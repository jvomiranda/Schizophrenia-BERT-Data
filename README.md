# Schizophrenia-BERT-Data
Dataset and Jupyter notebooks developed as part of a thesis project by the present author under the supervision of Prof. Cilene Rodrigues (PUC-Rio) and co-supervision of Prof. Emilio Vital (IBM). The project investigates linguistic patterns in schizophrenia using a BERT-base-cased model for text classification and linguistic analysis.

Repository accompanying the study on linguistic characterization of schizophrenia through BERT-based natural language processing. Includes curated Reddit data, preprocessing scripts, fine-tuning notebooks, and statistical analyses conducted to explore language markers of SZ and evaluate model interpretability.
