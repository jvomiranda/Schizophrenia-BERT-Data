# Schizophrenia-BERT-Data
Dataset and Jupyter notebooks developed as part of a thesis project by the present author under the supervision of Prof. Cilene Rodrigues (PUC-Rio) and co-supervision of Prof. Emilio Vital (IBM). The project investigates linguistic patterns in schizophrenia using a BERT-base-cased model for text classification and linguistic analysis.

Repository accompanying the study on linguistic characterization of schizophrenia through BERT-based natural language processing. Includes curated Reddit data, preprocessing scripts, fine-tuning notebooks, and statistical analyses conducted to explore language markers of SZ and evaluate model interpretability.

## Model Fine-Tuning Files

The fine-tuning files and model checkpoints used in this project are available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/jvomiranda/Schizophrenia_Manually_Curated_31k).  
You can access them there to reproduce results, continue training, or use the model directly through the Hugging Face interface.
