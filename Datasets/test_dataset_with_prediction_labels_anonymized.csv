I finally got booked in for a blood test, still had all the symptoms, was genuinely planning my life around the fact that I was now diabetic (including restricting my diet).

I'll try to make this too laborious but give a little back story.  My fh is about 20 years older than me (I'm in my early 40s) and had been divorced for a couple years before we met. He wanted the divorce; she didn't. They have three children together that are all in their 30s.  His children didn't know he was dating anyone until there was a medical issue and found out about me. 

Fast forward a year and a half later he's  planning to propose and he tells all of our children before he does. His children insist upon telling their mother BEFORE he proposes to me so that she doesn't find out on social media. (They don't follow one another). I was adamant she didn't need to know before as they aren't friends and aren't coparenting children. He explained he would tell her but on his own time. His children chose to tell her before he proposed anyway. I found this out while we were out of town, after he proposed. I was very upset that his children did what they wanted anyway and were completely disrespectful to his and my wishes. It has caused arguments between us. He is a rather passive person and doesn't like to address things; he's rather avoidant. I, on the other hand, would rather address something and let it be aired out.

We are now a few months before our wedding and it has never been discussed. What's done is done, and that can't be changed but I do feel a conversation needs to happen in regards to his children disrespecting us both by telling their mother even though we didn't want her to know ahead of time. I know without a doubt this man is my person but I struggle with this situation. To be clear.. it's not a dealbreaker or even close. I just need to get it off my chest.  So, am I the asshole?

Lost control of my thoughts, they raced away on random topics and I simply couldn't focus or stop. Had a panic attack for the first time when I realised what was going on.

It went downhill from there and too many things happened to go into detail. The episode lasted for around 3 months. I started hallucinating and became delusional. Heard voices telling me terrible things like commands to commit suicide. People were watching me and giving me dark looks, and they were also talking to each other about me either plotting against me or making fun of me. I could see a dark aura around people which are evil spirits influencing them in the name of Satan to antagonise me. Everyone in the world are psychopaths except for me. My mum had mind control powers. Its just utter terror mixed with confusion. 

Throughout all this my brain felt like scrambled eggs. I hardly slept and I felt delirious and brain foggy. When the racing thoughts are bad I basically become catatonic.

And it's NOT because we're weak, but rather because we lack the adequate neurotransmitters (dopamine and serotonin) to function rationally. It's all chemical. 

Unless you're neurodivergent - you'll never understand what an honest struggle it is to be ""functioning"" at society's standard. Schizophrenia is an evolving beast that you have to learn how to tame and regularly ""calm""... **It's not a fun disorder to live with by ANY means.**",1,TP,1

I asked her if there's anything I could change to make her more comfortable and she said everything's fine. But it's clearly not fine. What do I do?","She's clearly putting a huge amount of effort into tolerating things she finds off-putting about me, instead of telling me. And then her huge amount of effort spent managing, handling, lying, and avoiding has become another thing she finds unbearable about being around me. 

The way I'm used to relationships working is that people initially find several things off-putting or annoying about me, and at some point they tell me and I fix it and then we get along.

Annie seems to have found a few things off-putting about me around 6 years ago and just carried that burden quietly ever since. 

I'd guess she thinks that she like, owes it to my wife to never be in conflict with me or never say anything negative about me or something. But, uh, it's putting her in secret super awkward conflict with me. 

I feel unsafe around her, because I have nightmares I'm going to just do my best by her, get some stuff wrong because I don't know what she likes or doesn't like, she'll say it's fine, and then in 20 years from now she'll write a heart-wrenching expose about her nightmare brother in law from hell.

I've already overheard her saying to her friend on the phone ""Yeah Snapwillow is visiting and it's as unbearable as always. Rescue me"" and then a bit later got picked up by that friend and disappeared for the day. 

Two things that make this even weirder: 

First: She's super opinionated and outspoken about everything. Always speaks her mind. The one exception is me. Never has any kind of take on me. 

Second: When I see her interacting with people other than me, I think she's a really cool person. Like, she's almost role-model status for me (except about this issue obviously). If she had any kind of feedback, advice, or criticism about me, I'd be eager to hear it. And I've asked for her advice plenty of times.

It sounds like a bad quality audio of coins clinking together? Like a jangly noise? but more shrill & sharp, I can't really describe it other than purely annoying. I have crimson Nirnroot in my inventory but it definitely isn't that because nirnroot's ringing has more of a humming sound to it.

I thought I was losing my marbles, I assumed I was hearing things until I noticed it went away when I closed out of Skyrim or muted my computer. I decided to go into settings and mute the effects audio which made the sound go away (and only the effects slider, so it must be an effect of some kind), but I'd still like to know if anyone has a clue as to what the fuck it could be.

Could it be any of my armor/weapons or enchantments? [This is currently everything in my inventory.]( As for Misc, I just have a bunch of ores, soul gems (none empty), gems, heart stones. The usual things that as far as I can remember, haven't caused any noise previously. I have no mods installed. 

I also recorded the noise, although the video is jumpy because I had no clue if it was recording yet or if it was just messing with my screen for no reason, and apparently the hotkey for stopping/starting also loads a save in Skyrim, but the noise can be heard within 2 seconds of the video. [ Video is taken in Kolbjorn Barrow but the noise happens regardless of where I am.

username#00745,comment,,"If its PTSD then its gonna still be there. PTSD is not simply a psychological condition its whats referred to as a psychosomatic condition which means it has a physical presence in the nervous system (the body) which was created alongside the traumatic memory in the brain.

If time has passed, but there still hasnt been any effective treatment then its still going to be there in the body. One of the biggest misconceptions of PTSD is that any amount of time or psychological thinking is ever going to do anything about it on its own.

Remember that a trauma is a trauma when something which happens is too much for the mind to be able to process and so it stays stored unprocessed in both the body and the mind. If its still coming back 27 years later then its real, end of discussion.

For treatment I recommend researching somatic/emdr therapists, somatic massages, and mdma assisted trauma therapy. All are very different approaches but have significant medical evidence that they are extremely effective. For personal research I recommend learning as much as possible about poly-vegal theory as it is the foundation of understanding what has happened to you and why. The body keeps the score is an excellent book for laying out what this condition actually is.

As far as dealing with the government thats a whole other thing that I know very little about, I wish I had more to offer there, but I can tell you that no amount of time changes the legitimacy of the condition with PTSD in the eyes of someone who studies it.

Youre not crazy, and its not your fault that this is still going on. As someone whos been there before (non-military) my heart goes out to you. It is curable and I believe in you!

What man has asked God for forgiveness for what they did to His son and how they still, to this day abuse Christ and his sacrifice.

Girl at our school got caught fucking in the locker room, and now they keep it closed except when letting teams in. (DURING SCHOOL HOURS I might add)

Bathroom orgy. (Don't ask.)

Someone set off a stink bomb. (Last day prank.)

Someone threw around water balloons filled with bleach. (Also a last day prank.)

Someone got their nudes leaked to the whole school. (Literally overnight)

Some kid got caught getting ""action"" from two girls in the band hall. (Not the smartest idea.)

School shooting threat. (Ah, but that's normal in the US)

Players destroying the locker room. (They lost every game this season)

Some dude got taken out of class for having vodka in a water bottle. 

Someone threw baby powder/flour around at our home coming game. A TON of it, enough to choke everyone up.

Old theater arts teacher got fired for groping a girl and telling her ""how sexy she is"". (What the fuck.)

Dude smashed a window out of frustration of getting underclassmen pregnant. 

Someone burst into another class and started beating the shit out of another guy for touching his sister. (I don't blame him)

Announcer for another school used racial slurs against our school at football game. (Also called a cheerleader fat.)

School dances nearly cut because condoms kept getting found in the bathroom.

Big fight that ending up with a gun being pulled. (That gun was passed through five people btw)

I live in an area with a HOA (didn't have much choice, pretty much every neighborhood has a HOA in my area). Until I moved into a house, I thought HOAs were groups of catty old women that give out fines when people break their dumb rules like ""no lawn flamingoes"". My dumbass thought, I would just be able to take it down from the inside by joining the rest of the catty ladies. Apparently I was wrong. My HOA is a company run out of an office located in a completely different state. No catty ladies with nothing better to do, rather actual employees. So if they even have rules, not like they can enforce them, or really do anything at all. I guess it's not too bad because having an HOA that's not even local is like not having one at all, but it just feels like well what the hell is the point of the HOA fee then.

 I would cry everyday not wanting to go back to work. I've cried in front of customers, I've cried in front of my manager. Even as a cashier I was never able to go fast enough for their standards. 

I have chronic pain in my thighs, having to stand the entirety of a shift is just an 8 hour experience in hell (especially with the fluorescent lights most stores have, they'd mess with my head). Also because thanks to my health my body's so pathetic I have a hard time lifting things, I once had to carry a 20 lb turkey across the store because my manager didn't believe I'd struggle with that. Thank God the butcher saw me having a hard time with it and carried it rest of the way for me.  

I can work fast when it comes to what I do now, but not fast food fast. Used to be a sandwich/salad/wrap maker for Wendy's but making multiple meals (some meals including 10+ burgers) in 3 minutes was sadly outside my skill range. 

I'm shocked how people can have the ability to go back each and every day and put up with that bullshit. Managers look at you like raw meat, I once called to say I was going to the ER which was responded with ""do you **have** to do that now? Why would you ever have to do that now?""

He had always *wanted* to fall in-love (I'm saying that to differentiate between *having* love for a person), which he did - with me. And he was partially ecstatic to have it - this thing he had waited such a long time for, but also he felt ill being in-love. He broke up with me actually because he felt like being with me was like being on a drug, and he had no control and felt invaded. It's a terrible dichotomy because its something we want and long for but when it causes pain or makes one feel like they are taking drugs, it is understandable to push that [person] away. Extra difficult when it causes conflict, wanting the person, but not wanting to feel out of control or invaded. Equally for the other person to also be in love with this person while knowing that it causes them such difficulty. Sigh!

Being in-love or falling in-love is usually a pleasant experience, if not intense and sometimes difficult.

Germany's submarines are good, but absolutely not the ""most advanced,"" especially not when compared to the US Virginia, Ohio, and Seawolf class submarines, or even the UK Astute submarine, which is an incredible achievement. 

I would say the same about the Leopard 2A6. A good tank on paper, but not the world's most advanced. It has 100ms higher muzzle velocity than the M1A2 Abrams, but still doesn't match the Abrams in penetrating power because of the actual shell. The Abrams uses DU rounds that offer incredible penetration, while the Leopard must use Tungsten rounds because of environmental regulations. It has a slightly lower top speed than the turbine-powered Abrams, and doesn't have the same degree of armor protection. The greatest power of a tank though, is the crew, and I'd say the Americans have the most experienced tank crews in the world, because they can't seem to keep their asses out of a war every chance they get.

username#01188,comment,,"I play a lot of fetch with my pup indoors. He's a Bernese Mountain Dog, just turned a year today, over 100lbs. Neither of us do well in the heat *at all.*

For the special occasion, I had blown up a bunch of balloons and let him chase them around. He loved it. He was excited and confused at the same time.

He's got a ton of toys, so typically what I'll do is grab about 10 of his (current in time) favorites. I'll sit down (I have CFS so I have to be careful with my energy output) and I'll play with him. I'll let him have some tug-o-war time, but my primary focus is fetch. This gets him running around a lot more and burns way more energy than what tug-o-war does. When I can tell that he's good and worn out, I'll get one of his treat dispenser toys and fill it with some peanut butter. Typically, while he's trying to work on getting his treat, he'll fall asleep. But it's there when he wakes up and it gives him something stimulating to do for a while.

Thankfully, he's a fairly chill pup and has been since I'd gotten him. Not to say that he doesn't have the puppy energy... but not nearly as bad as any other I've had.

That being said, mind-stimulating tasks are just as important as running around. If you don't have any, I reccomend looking into some treat-dispenser puzzle toys.


Also. There are toys out there that are power-operated and will roll around and bounce on their own. I plan on trying one out myself, soon.",dogs,0,2024-06-24 03:05," I play a lot of fetch with my pup indoors. He's a Bernese Mountain Dog, just turned a year today, over 100lbs. Neither of us do well in the heat *at all.*

For the special occasion, I had blown up a bunch of balloons and let him chase them around. He loved it. He was excited and confused at the same time.

He's got a ton of toys, so typically what I'll do is grab about 10 of his (current in time) favorites. I'll sit down (I have CFS so I have to be careful with my energy output) and I'll play with him. I'll let him have some tug-o-war time, but my primary focus is fetch. This gets him running around a lot more and burns way more energy than what tug-o-war does.

username#00554,comment,,"I'm currently a freshman in college so keep in mind this could still change.

Since sophomore year of high school I've wanted to major in Musical Theatre (BFA) and I spend three years of high school preparing for college auditions with acting and singing lessons. Senior year of high school I auditioned for about 8 programs and got into 1 (CCPA) which I had to decline due to it being too expensive. 

So I ended up gong to the school I am at now because of 1.) money and 2.) the let people who didn't get into the BFA re-audition halfway through the school year. So I was feeling pretty confident about re-auditioning, and spent first semester taking dance, singing, and acting lessons to prepare for it. So the audition comes, I don't get in, but neither does anyone else who re-auditioned and it turns out the school never planned on letting anyone into the program in the first place. This pissed me off because when I auditioned they didn't judge me on how good I was but rather knew the answer was no from the moment I walked in.

So the next few months were hell. I had come to this school with the goal of being a musical theatre BFA and now there was no way that was going to happen, and if it did happen I would being going to school for 5 or 6 years which is something I did not want to do. I spent the next few months incredibly depressed and feeling like I didn't have a future anymore. 

So during this time I started watching a bunch of movies and reading a bunch of book which are both things I already did a lot of anyway but this time I was like ""oh hey, I really like these things. Maybe I like them even more than theatre"". I had always liked writing and I used to write a lot (I'm talking like one short story a day) and I stopped so I could focus on theatre and I was like, maybe I should do that again?

So at this point in time I've changed my major to creative writing with an emphasis in screenplays. Theatre is now my minor and since I only took theatre classes this year, it's completed and I can add another minor. I'm hoping to add Japanese so I can teach english in Japan after college, or add a film minor so I can have a better understanding of film. Best case scenario, I add both.

So obviously, things aren't doing in the direction I spent most of my life dreaming they would, but I'm still very happy with this decision. Going to school for theatre hurt my passion for it, I'm not really sure why but I don't love it as much as I used to. Going to school did however help me realize that theatre isn't exclusively what I love, it's storytelling in general which can include all sorts of different art forms I'm interested in exploring.",AskReddit,1,2017-01-26 19:03:15," I'm currently a freshman in college so keep in mind this could still change.

Since sophomore year of high school I've wanted to major in Musical Theatre (BFA) and I spend three years of high school preparing for college auditions with acting and singing lessons. Senior year of high school I auditioned for about 8 programs and got into 1 (CCPA) which I had to decline due to it being too expensive. 

So I ended up gong to the school I am at now because of 1.) money and 2.) the let people who didn't get into the BFA re-audition halfway through the school year. So I was feeling pretty confident about re-auditioning, and spent first semester taking dance, singing, and acting lessons to prepare for it. So the audition comes, I don't get in, but neither does anyone else who re-auditioned and it turns out the school never planned on letting anyone into the program in the first place. This pissed me off because when I auditioned they didn't judge me on how good I was but rather knew the answer was no from the moment I walked in.

So the next few months were hell. I had come to this school with the goal of being a musical theatre BFA and now there was no way that was going to happen, and if it did happen I would being going to school for 5 or 6 years which is something I did not want to do.

username#00647,comment,,"To be completely frank, I don't think it will hit a 10 year old, by law. And I think it's wrong to punish the victims in this. But my god, I see the seriousness I their faces, when I teach 13-15 years olds about this when I'm a guest lecturer, and I think it works more to have as a potential punishment than everything else. How many times has it happened? I have no idea, I just know that it exists. And that it helps children stop. I think it much more often hit 16 year old boys when they share revenge porn of their girlfriends. Which I've seen happen. 

Also, it *is* evil to punish children for sexual acts. However, I do think many children, from about the age of 12, do enter puberty with a lot of natural and internal curiosity. Girls bodies change so much from such a young age, and I believe it's not unheard of that some girls might take a picture of it because it's fun, different and exciting. Both cameras and their bodies are very accessible to themselves. Most of the next steps of sharing are often steeped in manipulation though. But we do have to recognize children's curiosity and how that is not evil, disgusting or bad. I believe that teaching children every sexual urge is evil, is just as much of an assault than asking them to share a pic of their body. Of course, direct assault and being an aggressor in many other ways are definitely worse, but I do think we need a balance so they can grow up to be happy adults with a healthy relationship with sexuality.",TrueOffMyChest,1,2023-10-18 05:19:41," To be completely frank, I don't think it will hit a 10 year old, by law.

I've been an atheist for about 2-3 years  now, I never told my parents, just my close friends and SOME teachers that I knew wouldn't tell my parents.

I became an atheist primarily after I had my first ""psychotic break"", I was having delusions about religion etc. So when I came out of that I got rid of religion all together, not saying that was the only reason, just a good reason to not go back to religion.

I also stopped being religious because I saw how utterly idiotic in my mind it was and it was quite delusional, so here I am now, non religious. These aren't the only reasons of course just some of MANY. 

So yeah, enough of my rambling, how do I open up to my religious parents? My family is a really religious family, even their parents were extremely religious, It's just how they were brought up and I'm scared incase I break their ""tradition"".

That is simply how ENBs work. Games are made in such a way that they use DirectX (Or vulkan or OpenGL or Metal) to draw out the graphics for them. Therefore, a dev decides that they'll add certain features that DirectX provides to them.

Along comes an ENB that adds in extra and advanced graphics that the game has no idea about. It will still draw them in, but it'll be more taxing to your PC since the game wasn't made with those features in mind.

Sometimes, ENBs don't add anything as much as they modify what was originally set up but it is still a bit more taxing to your PC. Hence the framerate drop.

Still got my 10k steps on the walking pad before noon, still did my 45 min of stationary biking (and by some miracle absolutely SMASHED my previous personal record!), still did day 8 of [Nick-E.com]( beginner's calisthenics routine, although I did not start with the kettlebells when I told myself I would for about the fifth day in a row.

Today I weighed 136.6 pounds, down from my previous low of 137.0 (61.96 kg from 62.14). That means that I've lost exactly 77 pounds, or 34.93 kg. Well over half my current bodyweight. Feeling good about that.",loseit,1,2024-06-17 10:28:48," Hello Europe!

username#01095,comment,,"The 46-year-old had been engaged in sexual activity with David Andrew Jeffers, 47, at a Stockport hotel in January when she was shot.
Jeffers admitted possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and was jailed for 10 years.
The two had been engaged in a ""sex fantasy"" when the weapon fired, the Crown Prosecution Service said.

When officers arrived at the scene they found the victim in a pool of blood and suffering from serious abdominal injuries.
She was taken to hospital and required extensive surgery, police said.
'Badly bleeding'
The woman, who was too unwell to be fully interviewed at the time, told officers from her hospital bed that Jeffers was a ""bad man"".
Police said Jeffers, of Berkley Terrace, Leeds, claimed to have found the gun in a pub toilet in Leeds. He said he took the gun to Manchester to dispose of it.
Jeffers was spotted on CCTV leaving the hotel and going to Piccadilly Station to catch a train back to Leeds.
Armed officers raided a property on Amberton Grove, Leeds, two days later and arrested Jeffers.
A search of the house found a partially scrawled note denying knowledge of the shooting, the court heard.
Det Insp Roger Edwards said: ""This was a horrifying incident that has left a woman with life changing injuries that will affect her for the rest of her life.""
He said the crime was ""one of the most shocking"" he had encountered, adding: ""Jeffers left the victim badly bleeding in a hotel room, showing no regard for her life.",MorbidReality,0,2017-08-04 21:32," The 46-year-old had been engaged in sexual activity with David Andrew Jeffers, 47, at a Stockport hotel in January when she was shot.

As a child, I believed that I was an inhuman spirit born into a human body with the sole purpose of fighting with other spirits for the control of the universe. ... I guess this is the kind of thing you think of when you're 4. However, this meant that I was always scared of my ""enemies"" trying to kill me, and I hallucinated myself as both victim and instigator of horrendous amounts of violence from a very young age.

I wasn't supposed to let anyone catch me eating or sleeping, even though, quite naturally, that is necessary for all children. As a result, I was undernourished and often sleep-deprived for many years until I started being left alone more in my teens.

From what I understand about Japanese culture, saving, losing, or giving face (*mentsu wo tamotsu)* is closely linked to avoiding shame. It's an extremely important concept in this culture. Another important concept is *tatemae,* or saying what you want your listener wants to hear.

The belief is that many will go to great lengths to save face - [sometimes even telling lies to protect themselves]( I've read [papers]( that talked about the [Japanese justice system]( and how it's much easier to get off with a less severe sentence if you admit guilt even though innocent (the prosecutors way of saving face from a faulty accusation). There was also the case of WWII and the Japanese Empire lying about the treatment of [American prisoners of war.]( There was lying about war-time medical experimentation. Even larger corporations (like all other countries) are guilty of lying to save face and avoid shame.

I had a trip planned with my girlfriend to go to Japan and one of the things my Japanese-native friend had told me was the importance of saving face and the experiences I could encounter with locals once over there.

Filipinos have another term *hiya* or shame. Koreans have their own term as well.

I'm Filipino and I've seen these concepts in practice many times. Aunties and Uncles saying ""Yes"" to avoid the shame that comes with hurting someone's feelings. I've lived with Korean friends and family who share similar experiences.

It's been tough as I was born in America and I now work a corporate job, so the idea of saving face always seemed foreign to me. Why would I tell a white-lie when I can get straight to the point? Who cares in the work place?

I'm definitely not condoning the behavior of the Chinese government. They've done terrible things and need serious reform (as does ours). However, when we look at the decisions they make through a lens of saving face and ""trying to look good to others,"" it becomes easier to find a reason why they do certain things.

Perhaps he doesn't want to start a relationship just before he leaves the country, maybe he has met someone else and wishes to pursue it, perhaps he doesn't feel how you do.

You can ask what he feels but it honestly sounds like he has told you already, and it doesn't seem like being together is in the cards for him. It won't feel good for him to oblige you, it wouldn't be honest and it wouldn't (really) be what you want - which is him to feel the same way about you. If he were to agree to a relationship, the problem would quickly switch from ""why won't he be in a relationship with me"" to ""why don't you love me enough"", ""why is he pulling away""...whatever, it would just turn into a different issue because somewhere a need won't be being met.

username#01008,post,I (F21) said very mean things to my ex (M29),"This is gonna be a long one. So please bear with me. 

My ex had sex with the day we broke up. We broke up at 2:30am and he did it at around 5:00pm. When he told me this on Friday, I told him very mean things. I knew his insecurities so I knew how to hurt him bad. 

Okay, that's not the only reason I said spiteful things to him. Here's the full context. We broke up on Monday morning. He did it Monday afternoon. On the night of the same day, he covered a song for me and edited a montage of our photos and videos and told me that that's gonna be the last video he'd send me. The next few days, we would occasionally chat and ask each other how we were. I found out on Wednesday that he added the girl that I was jealous of (context: when we were starting, he already told that girl that he was exclusively dating someone but she still sent a photo of her in an underwear so I made him cut her off). Throughout the week, we would call for a bit but I already told him that that was not how breakups work so he had to learn how to live without talking to me. 

On Friday, I finally decided that okay, I was gonna give this relationship another chance. We talked for hours about what we needed to improve on so our relationships would be better. When I found out that he added the girl I was jealous of, I also added back my friends whom he was jealous of (whom in no way disrespected our relationship by sending nudes to me while I was in a relationship, but they were previous flings). I also made an alter account in twitter (an alter account is an account where you don't show your face and oftentimes, the content there is sexual and suggestive). Last Wednesday, on the same day I made an alter, he found out that I had one so he asked me to deactivate it until we sort our things out. I did it apprehensively, as a respect for him.

So back to Friday when we were telling each other what needed to change for us to work better. One of his non-negotiables was my alter account so he demanded it in exchange for his account. He told me not to delete anything on my inbox there so I did not. So we exchanged accounts. Later on, I found out that he deleted three of his conversations with other girls because he was flirting with them. I got mad at him because that was unfair but we got past that. I am a vengeful person so at first, I told him to give me back my alter for two days so I could flirt with others just like he did. He was oddly okay with it, I knew him, he was an extremely jealous guy so it was odd for him to be okay with that. But then I swallowed my pride and decided that moving forward, I had to change that attitude. 

When we were almost done and we're almost together, he dropped the bomb. He told me he would come clean: he had sex with another girl. He told me he did it to get over me and after he did it he realized that he didn't want to do it with anyone except for me. He said it was his default reaction. To some extent, he justified by saying that I did not treat him well that's why he needed validation from another person to fill the gap I  left. 

I scrapped everything off and told him that we're over and that I'd ask my friends to cut him off entirely. I also hurt him by saying spiteful things to him about his insecurities. 

I told my friends about this and they were mad at him. They tweeted mean stuff to him, even messaged him that he was a ""sad boy manipulative"", etc. Maybe he saw their tweets so he made a poll on his twitter asking if having sex after a breakup is ok and his twitter friends validated that yes it was okay and it was cheating (which I never said it was, and that was not the point, the point was 1. he did it not even 24 hours after our breakup and 2. he asked me unfair things like deactivate my alter and not delete messages which he himself did). We had a groupchat where we tore him apart by saying mean things about him. I'm not gonna lie, every insult my friends tell stung me a bit. I mean I still have feelings for him, more hatred but some affection and possibly even love, a bit of it. Then he messaged me. He asked me to talk and clear things out.

I accepted it and called him. He was so calm about it. Sad and calm. He asked me to stop my friends from tweeting about him, which I did. At the end of the call, I realized that we were so mean to him. I asked him if he would still want to be friends (was that okay?) and he said that the things I told him about his insecurities were the most hurtful words he'd received from anyone so he wasn't sure if he would be ready to be friends again.

username#00731,comment,,"I think you're confusing 2 different concepts: ""Transfer"" and ""Release"".

""Release"" is what I think youre meaning. This is where a club wants to get rid of a player, but still has to pay said player. Lets say \[Club\] have signed a player for 100,000 a week for 4 years. This tells the player that he can expect to be paid a total of 20.8m (100k x 52 x 4). 2 Years into that contract, the club are thinking ""Look youre a shit player, we dont want you around anymore"", BUT they're still locked into a contract and (at that time) owe the player 10.4m in wages. The club will have to pay 10.4m to the player up front to ""release"" them from their contract. Now obviously they might agree it with a player for a lower fee (""We'll give you 6m, you can leave us and continue your career""), but the player is entitled to hang around and get paid to do nothing, see Jack Rodwell at Sunderland.

Then you have a transfer. A transfer is when a different club wants to buy the player. So same idea, the player is 2 years in/2 years left on his contract, and another club offers to buy the player. This does not mean that the players contract gets paid out, this would be more akin to a club selling *a thing* to another club. The player would agree a NEW contract with the NEW club, which would roll-over-to when he joins the new club, but they're not buying out an old contract.

username#00919,comment,,"My true story no one believes is that my college girlfriend assigned me to take her roommate on a date. 

It was annoying her that her roommate (who'd been her friend freshman year before they moved in together) had absolutely terrible boyfriends all the time. She always ended up with shitheads and my girlfriend didn't like having them around, and didn't like how they mistreated the roommate. Didn't like the drama, and thought she deserved better. So my girlfriend asked her why she picked the men she does. And long story short, the roommate had grown up in Morrocco with a highly misogynistic father and had been taught a really shitty model of men, women, and courtship. Including that she should never show any interest and that if a man was really interested, he'd violate her boundaries to aggressively pursue her. And that kind men were immature or not manly or some bullshit.

So my girlfriend came up with this crazy idea that the roommate and I were both talked into somehow, that I should take the roommate on a mock date to show her what actual kind and respectful dating is like.

So, given the rules that we were only allowed to talk flirty, compliment, and walk arm-in-arm but no more, I took my girlfriend's roommate to the mall to eat at a restaurant, window-shop, and see the Wonder Woman movie. And after we hung out chatting at a food court table and played some arcade games. 

I showed up on time. I asked her questions about her life. I complimented her outfit and her hair. I made jokes. I shared how I was feeling about my own life. I acted just like I would if I was on a real first date. We had a good time. I offered my arm and she took it as we walked. I asked for her input about things like where we wanted to walk and if it was time to move on and where to sit in the theater and etc. I got her to share her thoughts about things and listened and asked questions. At the end I told her this was fun, and I hope she has a good night.

What was very revealing afterward is that she kept saying things like ""but it wasn't really a date you were just being like a friend though right? If you were actually into me you would have [insert pushy obnoxious immature or demeaning thing here"" and I had to tell her a dozen times that no, really, that was how I would act on a first date with a woman I was actually interested in.

She was also surprised to hear that throughout the date it was unclear to me if it was going well, and that she seemed probably uninterested, and that I probably would've gone home thinking it wouldn't work out because she probably didn't like me. She didn't know she should show interest. When she went on dates she thought she was supposed to act disinterested for modesty, and an interested man would force things regardless of her feelings. 

This resulted in a second mock date in which she was assigned to act like she was interested in me. Which she actually enjoyed very much. Apparently getting to want things is fun. (though not to be too full of myself, she did say that was all an act because I'm not her type).

Her next boyfriends were progressively less shitty, kinder, and more mature. It worked.",AskReddit,0,2024-03-23 16:49," My true story no one believes is that my college girlfriend assigned me to take her roommate on a date.

This has been planned for two weeks now. I wont lie I didnt love the idea because my husband loves to drink and its been an on going issue for awhile. Hes not a mean drunk but hes annoying and mouthy. Hes also too touchy with me where hell stick his hands up or down my clothes in public without my permission and gets irritated at me when I ask him to stop. Theres been a two times in seven years where hes driven while buzzed up. Ill get furious with him because he could have wrecked or killed a family but he just says sorry I wont do it again. So I have major issues with this. 


He constantly tells me how he wants more nights with no kids so I can let loose and get wild if I drink.. I dont like to drink much and I hate when he tells me that because it makes me feel like Im not fun unless alcohol is involved. I come from an alcoholic mother so I have problems with it that go deeper. When I do drink its usually 4 beer max, if that. He gets defensive when I bring his drinking up so anymore I just dont to avoid an argument. 

Two days ago I came down with horrible allergies where my nose has been running constantly, my head is stopped up and my ears hurt. I told my husband yesterday if I felt like this today then I wasnt gonna go. Never once did I say if I cant go that means you cant either. But honestly, I dont want him to go. Because I dont want him to get drunk and do or say who knows what without me being there. I know I sound like a babysitter but I guess I dont trust him 100%. I didnt tell him that. 

He asked me earlier if I took medicine so I could go bowling. I said I told you yesterday if I didnt feel better I wasnt going. He immediately gets pissed and says so that means I cant go then huh? I said go then, I never said that. But if you get drunk then you can stay at friends house so I dont have to deal with you. He said I can tell by the look in your eye you dont want me to go. Stop acting like my babysitter like I cant do anything without you! I blew up and said I NEVER said that! 

I said that more out of anger because he automatically assumed I didnt want him to go when I never said that.

username#00635,post,"My [24F] brother [23M] has turned into a spoiled child, and is ruining our relationships with our family","My brother and I both grew up in a really shitty situation, we were dirt poor, we had an abusive father, and a lasseiz-faire mother. My mother has since divorced and remarried. We weren't really close as kids due to him being rambunctious and me mainly being quiet and shy.  

My mom and I sort of had a falling out (later repaired, ti some extent), and long story short, I moved with $300 to my name from the west coast to chase an now ex to the south. I met my best friend of 3 years, and now current boyfriend of a year [32M], made some money, and established myself. We moved in together about six months ago, and it's been wonderful, and shockingly easy. We fit into each other's lives just about perfectly, and we both come from shitty situations, so we've helped each other with a lot of trauma. My brother still lives with my mother on the west coast.

We were aware he hadn't had a job for more than a week or two, and he told me he was really trying to get on his feet, he just needed a push. So, we offered to bring him down to the south for a week or two, and give him that push. He immediately hopped on it, so we bought him plane tickets, made our spare room into a guest bedroom, and told him to plan for things he wanted to do. A month later, he's stepping off the plane. We immediately took him to dinner, he was polite, and then we got home.

He immediately seemed to change. He said he hadn't planned anything (we had some backups, luckily) and wanted to go fo his room. We figured it was just jetlag, showed him his room, and we all went to bed. The next morning, we got some breakfast, and showed him around our town. He complained about nearly everything. We decided to take him to dinner with a mutual friend of ours, who had just come out as gay to her extremely christian family. She was telling us about everyone, and how many people reacted positively, and he interrupts her with, ""Why are you talking about these people? I don't know ANY of them!"" During the dinner he proceeded to insult my job and our house. Miffed, we went home.

Over the next week, he manhandled our cat, screamed at me for talking when a song he liked was on the car radio, complained about everything we went to do, told us ""I've worked, you dont need to tell me what work is"" when we tried explaining our jobs, asked us to take him to a bar constantly so he could drink (neither of us drink a lot), slammed his entire body into the floor several times (we live in an upstairs duplex, I'm 120lbs, my boyfriend is 195lbs, and my brother is 300+lbs, and we tried lightly in worries of upsetting our neighbor), asked/joker about smoking weed in our home when we told him it was drug free, and after my boyfriend emotionally told him about the family members he'd lost, my brother proceeded to point to a vase in the house and ask, ""is that an urn?"" We explained it was a vase. He loudly asks, ""Oh, is the ""VASE"" full of human ashes?"" And loudly called it an urn and made suggestions that it was actually just full of ashes and we didnt want to tell him until my boyfriend was shaking and had to leave the room. We paid for everything while he was here, and the last day we learned he'd been sent with money to pay for himself, but had used it on DVDs and toys.

I want to help him still, but I worry he's past being able to help. Should I just call it all a loss and cut ties?",relationship_advice,1,2020-06-11 17:55:28,"My [24F] brother [23M] has turned into a spoiled child, and is ruining our relationships with our family My brother and I both grew up in a really shitty situation, we were dirt poor, we had an abusive father, and a lasseiz-faire mother. My mother has since divorced and remarried. We weren't really close as kids due to him being rambunctious and me mainly being quiet and shy.  

My mom and I sort of had a falling out (later repaired, ti some extent), and long story short, I moved with $300 to my name from the west coast to chase an now ex to the south. I met my best friend of 3 years, and now current boyfriend of a year [32M], made some money, and established myself. We moved in together about six months ago, and it's been wonderful, and shockingly easy. We fit into each other's lives just about perfectly, and we both come from shitty situations, so we've helped each other with a lot of trauma. My brother still lives with my mother on the west coast.

We were aware he hadn't had a job for more than a week or two, and he told me he was really trying to get on his feet, he just needed a push. So, we offered to bring him down to the south for a week or two, and give him that push. He immediately hopped on it, so we bought him plane tickets, made our spare room into a guest bedroom, and told him to plan for things he wanted to do. A month later, he's stepping off the plane. We immediately took him to dinner, he was polite, and then we got home.

He immediately seemed to change. He said he hadn't planned anything (we had some backups, luckily) and wanted to go fo his room. We figured it was just jetlag, showed him his room, and we all went to bed. The next morning, we got some breakfast, and showed him around our town. He complained about nearly everything. We decided to take him to dinner with a mutual friend of ours, who had just come out as gay to her extremely christian family. She was telling us about everyone, and how many people reacted positively, and he interrupts her with, ""Why are you talking about these people? I don't know ANY of them!"" During the dinner he proceeded to insult my job and our house. Miffed, we went home.

Over the next week, he manhandled our cat, screamed at me for talking when a song he liked was on the car radio, complained about everything we went to do, told us ""I've worked, you dont need to tell me what work is"" when we tried explaining our jobs, asked us to take him to a bar constantly so he could drink (neither of us drink a lot), slammed his entire body into the floor several times (we live in an upstairs duplex, I'm 120lbs, my boyfriend is 195lbs, and my brother is 300+lbs, and we tried lightly in worries of upsetting our neighbor), asked/joker about smoking weed in our home when we told him it was drug free, and after my boyfriend emotionally told him about the family members he'd lost, my brother proceeded to point to a vase in the house and ask, ""is that an urn?"" We explained it was a vase. He loudly asks, ""Oh, is the ""VASE"" full of human ashes?"" And loudly called it an urn and made suggestions that it was actually just full of ashes and we didnt want to tell him until my boyfriend was shaking and had to leave the room. We paid for everything while he was here, and the last day we learned he'd been sent with money to pay for himself, but had used it on DVDs and toys.

After he left, I texted him he was no longer allowed in our home, and that he had hurt my boyfriend and I, and that when he screamed at me my boyfriend had almost taken him out of the car and fought him, I said he really needed to watch his attitude before he got himself into trouble.

Im sitting in the doctors office as we speak, after just peeing in a cup. 

Last night around 11pm-midnight my lady bits started feeling strange. I kept having the urgency to pee. 

This morning into the afternoon, I feel ok but I keep having to pee! When I do pee, it feels weird. No pain, just weird. Ok, something is up. Im drinking water like crazy now. 

Around 4pm to currently, I started getting chills and the urge to urinate has been stronger. Now there is a tinge of blood in my urine. Omg! Still no pain when peeing or in my back/bladder. 

Off to the doctor I go. My temp was 98.6 at the doctor (after I had already taken fever reducer.) I just peed in a cup and there was some blood. (I did just stop my period the day before yesterday.)

I googled UTI symptoms and stories and now I wish I wouldnt have. 

Ugh. Im scared.

Well, honestly, the tax cuts are a hairy issue. My instinct is to say that a flat tax is the most fair (as long as it exempts those under a certain threshold), though, in reality that isn't the case. That said, I am not going to give a very straight answer.

I would like to see small businesses keep the tax exemptions. Under the Clinton administration, I saw many small businesses go under in the area that I was in because it was more economical for the owners (who were already rich) to just pull out and close shop than to keep operating. (My own mother was laid off for said reason). However, the rich tend to have most of their money invested where it's not getting taxed anyways. I'm not really sure how much people who are worth several million actually get taxed due to not really having ""income"" but rather just investments that just feed into themselves instead of being extracted.

Wed been together 2 years at that point and I felt blown away that this person who was supposed to know me and understand me so intimately legitimately thought that was what would make me feel better, when I felt like I was always painfully clear that talking about a fight or a problem is how I feel better. 

To be clear, I dont think theres anything wrong with sex to do a reset after a fight or anything, its just not my particular style, and him doing that still stands out as a huge exemplar of how wrong we were for each other.",0,TN,1

I'm on good medication now, every now and then I get the thought in my head that I should quit taking them, but I never let myself get that far and just force myself to take the pills quickly so I don't change my mind. 

I was also sexually abused as a kid. That's the big thing. The biggest thing in my world. When I realized what I had done to me.. it turns my stomach. I was apart of *that*. I still feel disgusting, feel my abuser touching me. Everything is broken.

I remember how little I was, 4 or 5 when it started, about 9 when it stopped, and on and off until I was 12, when he died(but not before he told me I was too old to play with him). 

My heart hurts for the little kid me that was so unconscionably lonely and craving love. I wish to save her, but that falls into my ""delusions"" about my abuser still being alive and everyone covering up for him.

I'm 25, a female virgin. I'm scared of sex. I'm scared it's going to feel like rape. I'm scared all the time people around me are pedophiles and can see through the adult me and want to hurt me. 

I get sexual urges. It makes me sick but I get them. I just don't know how to deal with them. My body does not feel like my own. It was taken away when I was a kid. Now since I developed Schizophrenia, I get therapy and medication but I can't take more than one class at college because if I take any more I'll get symptomatic, hear voices, and end up hospitalized for hurting myself due to the overwhelming strength of my symptoms.

About a year ago I had developed a serious case of diabetic ketoacidosis, as a type 1 diabetic this can have about a 3% chance of killing you and this was the 5-6th time I had it that year 

I had a bad habit of not taking my insulin as prescribed mainly due to self harm, I had control over something finally so I abused it 

I ended up with my blood sugars in the high 40s (mmol, the Australian measurement not the American) and my ketones at about 5mmol 

I went to hospital thanks to my mother who found me pale and looking like a corpse in my own puke 

In that hospital I was in ICU for about a day or two where I was in a diabetic coma, the doctor had told me my heart stopped and my brain started to starve itself, if that continued I would have been unrevivable I woke up feeling a rush of good feeling I suppose in my body, I felt so healthy, 

is this what feeling normal is like? If I keep my blood sugars managed will this feeling stay?

I had a bad habit of not taking my insulin as prescribed mainly due to self harm, I had control over something finally so I abused it 

I ended up with my blood sugars in the high 40s (mmol, the Australian measurement not the American) and my ketones at about 5mmol 

I went to hospital thanks to my mother who found me pale and looking like a corpse in my own puke 

In that hospital I was in ICU for about a day or two where I was in a diabetic coma, the doctor had told me my heart stopped and my brain started to starve itself, if that continued I would have been unrevivable I woke up feeling a rush of good feeling I suppose in my body, I felt so healthy, 

is this what feeling normal is like? If I keep my blood sugars managed will this feeling stay? 

The answer was yes 

Never again did I mess around with my insulin and never again have I been in DKA",1,TP,1

As someone whose career was in the beauty industry for 15+ years - it's the brands, the vendors, and marketing at fault.

 Advertising professional grade makeup to tweens is damaging because it has led to a new societal standard so exploited that women and girls alike are AFRAID to leave the house without at least foundation concealer and eyelashes (because god forbid they look less than perfect out in public).

Even though I didn't actually had any directly explicit materials made, I also edged a lot on it, from a very young age. And you know what? Now I'm almost 30, and that need I had for attention is much less, and much more fulfilled by my loving partner. It is the raging hormones that drives it, and it's the addictive feeling of knowing how and where to get it that potentially leads to unfortunate experiences.

Two things I have to point out:
1) this could have been a huge problem about 10 years ago. It was the fall of many girls. But so many young teen girls have been through the ringer at this point that no matter what you do, what you've done is not that special. Many girls have done it before you and you can try to find comfort in the fact that you won't be singled out as you would 10-15 years ago (this is to calm you, not to be negative). Much less social consequences, as everyone knows revenge pron exists and is wrong. That just wasn't a term back then

2) if you are under the age of 18, no matter what age of consent you have in your place of living, what you are producing is by default child pronegraphy (trying to avoid the bots here). Which means you are lucky nothing has happened yet, but you can potentially get a sex offender offence, even though you are the child depicted in the pictures and videos. So consider yourself probably lucky that nothing happened yet and please stop in order to avoid anything severe on your legal records.

""Is he going to pay for that?""

My mind wanders, a fissure shakes Walmart as my vision blurrs. My angel arrives, splitting the brimstone and the baker says something like,

username#00581,comment,,"Imagine you have a triangle that covers an area equal to 1, which represents an amount of energy. Each side of the triangle is labelled with mass, time, and speed, and the length of each of these sides is proportionate its related amount.

When you change your speed, the lengths of the other sides change. When you move faster, the length of the speed side gets longer and the length of the time side gets shorter. However, because energy must be conserved at all times and the triangle must cover the same area, the mass side will also get longer. 

In a faster than light scenario, the length of the time side will equal 0 and you would end up with a line instead of a triangle. Well darn, lines don't have area, they have length. So I guess that doesn't work. Okay, well what happens as the time side approaches 0 instead? As you extend the speed side and shorten the time side infinitely small, the mass side needs to extend as well to conserve the triangles original area of 1. This means the faster you move through space, the heavier you get.

As long as you have any amount of mass, you can not change the triangle in any way to get somewhere in 0 time. The only way to move faster than light is to either have no mass or don't experience time",explainlikeimfive,1,2023-09-15 11:25:10," Imagine you have a triangle that covers an area equal to 1, which represents an amount of energy.

We still lock up people for pot too. Which is why I'm so shocked at this outcome.

I had to call the police for a domestic issue within my own home twice in the past 48 hours. I'm a seasoned smoker, been doing dabs fairly medicinally for years now. I'm chronically anxious, I get very dark twisted thoughts and delusions, I get angry over small shit, Pot has **ALWAYS** helped me find my ground again. It keeps me from lifting off into the stratosphere. I know it can get a bad rep too, but weed genuinely is medicinal for me. I don't even use combustion, I vaporize. I try to just be both mentally healthy while also reducing the bodily harm.

Anyway, onto the point I was getting at. I have 2 very polite officers in my home for the second time and this time I had no time to clean up any of my mess downstairs, nor did I think of it. Lo and behold we're forced to go downstairs anyway, me, the 2 officers and the person I had to call for. 

So there we're standing in my basement with my bong, lime green and black light sensitive with the black light going, dragons, silicon bc my hands suck with glass **IN FULL CLEAR VIEW** 

the cop leans into my shoulder and says ""so is that like an electric bong that just uses electricity no fire or anything?""

I froze in absolute abject horror. I said the first thing that came to mind, a quiet, but affirming ^(yes, uh yea, it just uses electricity.)

I'm dead, I'm losing minutes off my life by standing here and doing nothing. I can feel life fading away from my body, I could pass out if I wasn't chock full of **adrenaline.** 

we move back upstairs and they are on their way out the door. I'm able to wave down the guy who asked the simple, but genuine question about the e-nail. I simply say: *I'm sorry to put you in that position, I would have put it away, I use it medicinally""*

You know what this **giga-chad** says to me? 

**Dude, it's just weed. I don't care.**

Was that the moment my entire conscious life had led up to? one officer telling me it's okay I enjoy smoking pot? Are we reaching a critical mass?

I'm preheating my rig now, God damn this shit just blew me away though. 20 years of fighting with police, hiding, all the hiding, the war on drugs, the jail time I personally have spent over it, I got kicked out of school for pot, no rehab, nothing, just gone, get lost kid.

But honestly, to me, it felt more awkward to do childish things as a teenager than as an adult. And if you look anywhere on the internet, it is widely recognized that many millenial adults do a shit ton of childish things and have a great time (like Legos, Disney land, etc).

But what this makes me think of is actually a term in my country called ""Curling Parents"". It's when parents try to sweep away every obstacle from their child and end up with a somewhat inept child who both have depression and anxiety because they have absolutely no idea how to navigate a world with responsibilities. It's really sad and a lot of people are affected by it these days, and their parents parents were *too* strict and didn't let them be a child. It's hard to find the middleground, but children need responsibilities to experience successes and to see they can easily handle it. Honestly, becoming and adult for me was fucking amazing, I can do all the shit I want to and nobody can really tell me no.

Here the other day at work, me and the other adults talked about tamagochis and how bomb they were, and as we have adult money, we all just bought one each and now we have fun playing with toys at work and we're having a fucking party. It's not impossible to keep your play and magic inside alive. And responsibilities are not really a problem when you're used to them.

No one understands me, I try and tell them how I feel, how I think and how I see the world but they will never understand and that makes me feel so alone. I've always tried to fix other peoples problems when I need to put myself first, but I just can't do that. I just can't.

It's that loneliness though that I feel even when I'm around people. I still feel lonely even if I'm in a group of people and I dunno why.

There's also the major issues of being unable to think properly, like I'll stop mid though about something and completely forget called thought blocking.  Echolalia is also a huge issue, especially with people that aren't used to it because they think I'm being a little pissant repeating everything they say.

Then there's the imposters, the fake people.  They aren't really there.  The shadow people.  Broken time.

The biggest overall issues are the negative symptoms like avolition and anhedonia.  Basically no energy nor motivation to do things to take care of yourself like brushing teeth, showering, shaving, laundry, chores, etc.  And there's no enjoyment out of anything in life, even if you love a certain thing.  I tend to mope around bored and lacking motivation to even get dressed.

Right now I'm still in my PJ's and it's 1:33 PM.

I can't enjoy any TV shows, movies, video games, nothing.  I scroll through TikTok, YouTube, Netflix, Crackle and other stuff, finding absolutely nothing to watch.  I looove cats, and can't even care about watching a cat video.

Going grocery shopping before delivery was a huge nightmare.  Too many people around, I was glad for the masking because it made me feel a little more hidden. I would see people's faces blur or distort, and I wouldn't be able to tell if a person near me was really there or not.

I once literally went psychotic in Wal-Mart near the bank waiting for my roommate and husband to meet back up with me.  The bank called the police about a suspicious person, gave them my description and location.  I had police with guns drawn on me and scared me shitless and believed the government was going to come after me to kill me and BOOM here they are.  I had to be held in Walmart in a tight hug for a while to calm me down before I could get myself to move.

The voices at that time were telling me that I'm about to be murdered, everyone is watching me, they expect me to rob the bank, they think I'm a criminal, you're going to be murdered, they're after you and then the police showed up.

One time I was talking to someone I found at the store that I've known for a long time, I'm in Alabama but he lives in Arizona.  I didn't think twice when I found him at the store and he started walking with me and chatting with me and people were just looking at me all fucked up and didn't realize why.

Any other questions?",oddlyterrifying,1,2022-04-05 18:39:21," I almost ruined my marriage because I believed my husband was an imposter and the real one was wisked away somewhere for several months, which terrified me to no end.  I also believed several times that my roommate was trying to poison me so I was super careful about food.

There's also the major issues of being unable to think properly, like I'll stop mid though about something and completely forget called thought blocking.  Echolalia is also a huge issue, especially with people that aren't used to it because they think I'm being a little pissant repeating everything they say.

Then there's the imposters, the fake people.  They aren't really there.  The shadow people.  Broken time.

#[Hello Reddit!](

My name is Ruben Major and I'm running for Secretary of State in California. I live in San Diego with my wife and three children. I was running for State Senate until I uncovered numerous and concerning security issues related to our election systems. That was when I moved over to the Secretary of State race.
 
Just to tell you a little bit about myself... I was born to a teenage mother in a dysfunctional home with an absentee father. But don't feel bad for me. When I was 14 I was able to move out and eventually received my law degree and a master's of military history. I have extensive training in counterterrorism which is required to keep our elections secured.
 
I am also a paramedic and the owner of an accredited educational organization that provides Emergency Medical Services Training for a variety of EMS and EMS related programs.

I am running a grassroots campaign from small, individual donations. I will not accept dark money or any contributions from SuperPACs or large corporations.
 
If I am so privileged to serve, I will usher in a new era of transparency in our elections systems that will ensure your vote counts. We will do this by eliminating the vulnerable and secret software which plagues us now and replace it with publicly owned systems and printed paper ballots. 

I'm looking forward to your questions today, so let's get started!

username#00586,post,Introducing two adult cats?,"Hello! 

I recently adopted a one year old kitty and I have a three year old kitty that I've known his whole life. I got new kitty on Thursday. 

New kitty is thriving and ready to come out of the bathroom. I go in to play and cuddle with him, and he rubs against me, flops over and shows his belly, is exploring, and eating/drinking. 

Old kitty has always been VERY shy, but has begun to come near the door when I open it to check on new kitty. No hissing, no anger at all, just a curious look. Old kitty was nervous at first, but now has resumed rubbing against me and walking around the house with no issue.

I scent swapped yesterday with washcloths and they both sniffed them eagerly. 

Are there next steps before allowing new kitty out? New kitty has a vet appointment scheduled next Wednesday for his last set of shots, but tested negative for any diseases.

Do I wait until Wednesday to let him out, or do they sound fine to meet each other sooner? Should I keep old kitty in the bedroom while new kitty explores the living room as a next step?

In my country, we have really good sex ed, and most of the older teenage girls/young adults/adults are intimately aware of the choices, and we are encouraged to have a good, healthy and consensual sex life. I have never met anyone who actually took the pill each day/had a IUD/used Nuvaring/had that thing they operate into your arm/had the birth control shots AND STILL accidentally got pregnant. Those stories are usually about people who forget a pill, or maybe puke it up or have very severe diarrhea for a week or something. The majority have sex without condoms with our partners in my country. Even those who use hormonal bc, rarely use condoms, but use diaphragms, timing and spemicide etc. Most hormonal birth control is pretty much 100% safe, as long as you take it correctly. I've had unprotected sex for more than a decade now, so have most of my peers, and I've only seen 1 accidental pregnancy, which was someone not using bc (I think it was a broken condom and she got an abortion, so no biggie) . And I've been close to people many people, and had many many friends who's had a ton of sex for more than a decade. No surprise babies.

And if we want to discuss fertility, I can tell you that I'm now in the age where all my friends are intentionally getting pregnant, and none of them have any issues except for one couple who was also very overweight, and then still managed in the end. It's like two weeks off bc's and babies are just shooting out everywhere.

I think the issue is mostly just bad sex ed and limited knowledge. Like, I fucking hate hormonal bc because it's uncomfortable, but I'd 1000 times over be hungry and moody all the time than have a baby.

All the stories about surprise babies is 99,9999% because people fuck up. Like, you have to take a bc pill the same time each day. If you forget a pill, you should probably hold off sex for a week. But other choices are easier. I have a plastic ring i just put inside me, and it releases hormones that creates three barriers of entrance for babies. So if one fails, another will probably succeed. They make a 'slime' blockage at my cervix. This is what happens, too, when you're pregnant, to prevent baby spillage. Semen cannot penetrate that.

username#01091,post,What is something negative you were told as a child that has hindered your spiritual and emotional growth to this day?,"Ill go first ...

I went to my best friends house after school to play and eat dinner. Ive always loved food. Ive always been taller/bigger than the rest of my classmates (I was a 5 foot 3 fifth grader (my moms height)). Anyways, there I was eating dinner with my best friend and her mom. I asked for seconds and she and her mom looked at me and laughed. Her mom proceeded to call me fat. My best friend agreed with her. There I was, a 10 year old, unaware of insecurities and such until that moment. From that moment on, I was self conscious in everything I wore.

I went to my best friends house after school to play and eat dinner. Ive always loved food.

I asked for seconds and she and her mom looked at me and laughed. Her mom proceeded to call me fat. My best friend agreed with her.

username#01089,post,Is it too soon to ask for mutual exclusiveness? Need advice.,"Ive been dating this guy for a little over a month. And even though I know its only been a month, I feel like hes perfect for me.

And let me tell you, this never happens to me. I actually get made fun of for having standards that are too high. I think about him all day and I truly have the best time when were together. He always takes care of me if I have some drinks, drives me home, and he calls me every night to tell me about his day.

Two weeks ago we were talking about where our relationship is going and he told me he didnt want to enter into a relationship just yet. I asked him if he was dating anyone else and he said no, but if Im out at a bar I do talk to girls. And I get that, it had only been 3 weeks of us dating. And I appreciated the honesty.

Fast forward to this past Friday, we went out to a bar. He brought two friends and so did I. It was the first time I had met his friends and vice versa. Our friend groups clicked immediately and it ended up being such an amazing night filled with drinks, him telling me how beautiful I looked and how lucky he was to have found me. I ended up spending the night with him. We didnt have sex but we did some other foreplay stuff.

The next morning he drove me home and texted me an hour later saying he already missed me. He then spent the entire weekend being super lovey dovey and saying how he had a great time this Friday and how it made him like me even more.

At this point, I would honestly be devastated if he were dating anyone else. Especially if hes sleeping with other people, since weve started doing some sexual things. I dont want him to necessarily meet all of my friends and family and put pictures of us all over social media. But I want us to exclusively date each other.   

Is it too soon to ask this of him? Im seeing him tonight and was wondering if I should just tell him how I feel. And if it scares him away then so be it. Obviously would be very upset but I want to be with someone who feels the same way, and him not caring if I date others shows he doesnt care about me as much as I care about him.

Or lazy. The doctors at the facility I work at rarely see patients at all, their NPs do.

Getting them to sign for anything is an uphill weeks long battle most of the time, they'll make up every excuse in the book (""just have the NP do it! What do you mean they can't? Have them do it anyway!""). 

Luckily the NPs are absolutely amazing. I don't have a bad thing to say about any of them. I know NPs get a lot of flack, but they're definitely great professionals.

username#01226,post,TIFU by putting my faith in humanity.,"This happened today, bit of some back story....there is this homeless fellow who I always see outside a local 7-11. He was a super nice guy, always smiling and making small talk before eventually asking for a few dollars. I have no clue if he actually wanted food, but it was probably drugs. I felt bad for the guy though, it can't be easy being homeless, especially in super cold weather. 

Then about a month ago I see him again, he does his little spiel and I say look, I have a bunch of leaves that I want cleaned up, how about you come over and take rake them. I offered some money, he came, did a good job and was super grateful. 

Fast forward to a few days ago, we had a snow storm, I saw him again and he offered to shovel for me. Told him sure, didn't set a date or time, just told him to come over and knock. While I fucked up bad. I am pretty forgetful and last night I carried in a bunch of groceries in the house  and I left my keys in the door. Yeah you can figure what happened. Also I was off today so I woke up and decided to play some newly released death stranding. I wear gaming headphones so I can't hear much outside the game. 

Eventually I get done playing and get ready to go get some dinner, open up my door to a nicely shoveled walkway and stairs and look across the street. My car is gone. I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure he came over, had the best intentions and shoveled and then knocked, but I didn't hear him so he wanted his drugs bad so he took the car. He probably sold it for pennies to get his fix.  I live in an unsavory neighborhood so I'm sure someone took it off him easily. Also time to change the locks.

TLDR tried to help a homeless guy with some yard work, but my dumbass left my keys in the door so he took my car as payment.

Edit: Update, I got a call three hours later, it was the police and they told me they pulled the car over and to come get it. Took an Uber about 5 blocks away and it was parked outside a store. I walked up to the car and the police guy rolls down the window and sure enough it was the same guy I suspected. The police saw the car parked and waited to see if anyone would get in into it and sure enough he did, them they pulled up on him and he go out immediately. He claims that someone handed him the keys, yet admits he shoveled which makes no sense at all, he was spouting off nonsense and screaming he didn't do it. Thank God nothing was damaged, he took a few small things from the console and did God knows what with it. Honestly he needs the be put in jail and get clean. Addiction will make you do crazy things.

While I don't play on the newer versions of Minecraft, I know that when mods were installed, it sometimes required a specific way of installing them and with the changes to the game, I haven't the slightest if the code has changed or not. So my question is:

If I wanted to create & install a mod on an older version of Minecraft, lets say for instance Beta 1.5 - Is it possible and is there anything that I should be aware of? Other than bugs which may cause the client to crash etc. * Edit - This would be for SP Only, so no need to worry about Multiplayer.",Minecraft,1,2019-06-07 07:21:17,"Question regarding older versions of Minecraft Heya all.

username#00432,post,When should I ask for a raise?,"I've worked at the same company since 2012, on and off because of medical issues(Schizophrenia & hospitalizations). I'm head Graphic Designer and in charge of various projects for the company, like our new website's portfolio, organizing all our internal files and getting them setup to go to a new place and backup, also managing our interns and making sure they have tasks to work on. 

Also note, this is my only job ever, I landed it at 21 and now I'm 24. I feel like I owe my boss so much.

After some time off, I started working again for the company in October or November of last year, after a hospitalization in September for a suicide attempt.

I got hired from an unpaid internship at the company in March of 2012, my rate being $9/hr, I got a .50 cent raise at some point, then in 2014 after I had been out of work for a while trying to focus on my health my boss welcomed me back with a $12/hr rate because the company was doing well. 

So here I am. The last time I missed work was this March when I was hospitalized for hurting myself.

My boss can be micromanaging and difficult to understand(English isn't his first language). He gets obsessive about unimportant things and makes everything seem urgent.

But he's also pretty great, because as many times as I've been hospitalized since 2012, probably at least twice a year, he ha always welcomed me back with open arms, knowing and understanding my Schizophrenia situation. 

So I'm afraid to ask for a raise, since he's done so much for me, always being wonderful and understanding.

username#00432,post,How to proceed with life...,"I'm 24, female. One semester away from my AA degree in Graphic/Web Design.. living with my mom. I moved back with her in September from a Sober Living home that I was in for my Schizophrenia(not an addict).

My mom is controlling, narcissistic, judgemental. It's very difficult to live with her. 

At the end of the year my dad and stepmom are moving to a different city and have invited me to live with them. They are wonderful, caring, loving people. Have some flaws, but they make me happy. Problem with this is that I'll be an hour and half bus ride from my work, where I do project management. It's not a total deal breaker, just a bit of a longer commute than I'd like.

My sister is moving back in June, she's pregnant with her 2nd child. She's asked me in the past to move in with her to help with finances, but this time she hasn't said anything, so I guess that isn't really an option. She's angry all the time and can be unhealthy so I'm going to leave that option as-is. 

I feel a sense of obligation to help my sister out financially, and guilt for not doing so.

I'm scared my mom will be hurt if I move out.

After writing this all, I think I just have to wait it out and live with my mom until my dad and stepmom get the new living situation in control...

Any feedback or anything?

She had her own family and I was nothing she wanted to remember. (not saying thats how you feel, I assume you feel the opposite) But she refused to give me any information about my father. She said he was a bad guy, he beat her, forced her to do things, ect, never wanted anything to do  with her or me. But it's 22 years later. And I have a right to know. I am not sure if I could ever forgive her for deciding for me that I don't need to know my father. How I feel about him is my choice. Maybe he is a dirtbag, most likely in all reality. But I am the one that gets to decide how I feel about him. What he did to her, honestly, I do not care about. I need to know him before I can care about that. And if he did do all that, then I need to deal with that on my own. Because to her he's just an asshole that she wants to never remember, but to me he's half of who I am. 

I would say talk to a counselor. Make sure you have someone to talk to. It takes a long time to heal and make sure you healing. Try to see you son if that is what you really want. As much as it will hurt and bring up the past and as much as you do not want to deal with his father, try to see him. And if you just cant right now, know that someday he will want to know you. I was in a closed adoption and had to wait till I was 19 to find my parents. It's a long wait. Not saying that you would, but make sure your son is never put in the middle. Don't tell him how you feel about his father. I would hope his father would do the same. Showing respect to each other in front of him will be good for him. The second it's parent vs parent he will pick a side. And thats not fair or healthy. 

I hope things work out and you are able to find some peace. I am sorry if that was harsh and I do not want to come across as mean. As the child of a similar situation I just wanted to tell my point of view. Lots of factors go into scenarios like this and obviously I can only speculate.

username#00581,comment,,"When math was formally ""discovered"" it was done by pattern recognition. The mathematician (Whoever it is) saw a recurring outcome by doing something specific. However, it did take thousands of years to invent calculus because sometimes these patterns are incredibly hard to see. However, after so many years, the human brain prevailed and thus calculus was born. We used knowledge of math that we have already to solve unanswered questions, and in turn used those answers to answer more unanswered questions. 

There is a problem though. The human brain -although quick as it is- is not nearly as fast as a computer. The circuitry of any device is between hundred of thousands to millions or times faster than we can unfortunately ever hope to be. The point is, if you had a self aware computer and you fed it some mathematical equations and told it to look for a pattern so it could quickly solve the problem given, it may only take seconds for it to derive a new formula for that specific problem.

The importance of creating AI is because it has the potential to be better than us at anything. Self driving cars have an incredibly low accident count. 

The beauty of creating AI is that we don't need to be able to be amazing at something to create a robot to do it better. I can't play chess to save my life, but given enough time, I could come up with some sort of algorithm for a computer to win 99% of the time.(Not actually but that's a popular example)

Here is the important reason to create AI:
If you can create an AI with roughly the intelligence of a human, and told it to go ahead and program another AI, it would do it better. Than all of a sudden you've got an AI better at making AI than you. So then the newest program writes another program that is even better than the last and the cycle continues. The AI will use the knowledge it already has to compute new answers to yet unsolved questions, implement what its found and repeat. 

This is an event called the Singularity. It is where computers become smarter than humans and solve every problem that has every existed or will exist; hypothetically. 

Ethics are called in to question here because our morals and laws apply to the human species. However, if a robot can exhibit all functions of a human, at a much higher capability, is it too a human?

I'm a bit off track, I do apologise. But the field of artificial intelligent design has an end goal in mind: to solve every problem ever. And thats why we keep making better and better ai.

3) I have a little bit of fat on my belly, but it hasn't changed or become flabby. If anything, my stomach seems less protruding by a small bit.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me! Obviously I can only share my experience, but I had a LOT of questions going in and my gyno had even more answers",1,TP,1

username#00643,comment,,"Hello Europe! 

I'm actually back in the States after getting to London Heathrow at 2 pm GMT yesterday and arriving  home at 6 am GMT this morning. Had a terrific fifteen days with my partner - I MEAN FIANCE - he proposed two days ago in London! I mean, it wasn't exactly a surprise, as part of the reason I went over was to give official notice at the registry office of our intent to marry, but he did a real proposal with the ring and getting down on one knee and everything! So now we're officially officially engaged and I'm over the moon. I love this man so much. 

Amazingly, upon weighing myself on my own scale at home, I found that I'd LOST three pounds since leaving for the UK on the 16th (145.2 - 142.2 lb so 65.86 - 64.2 kg). I was certain I'd have like 10 lb at least of water weight to lose and a few lb of fat after not sticking strictly to keto plus just eating a lot for two weeks! So that was a happy surprise. Maybe had something to do with all the walking we did - over 25k steps on Wednesday, for example, over 20k yesterday, etc. 

I plan to make June a fitness extravaganza for myself. I'll be switching up my diet to really focus on hitting my protein goals, which means more chicken breasts and collagen/protein powder and peanut butter shakes (will buy blender today). I'll be buying a walking pad and standing desk so I can get more steps in just by existing at my computer (won't be cutting out outdoor walks though, gotta get that vitamin D!), kettlebells for strength training, and iron and omega 3 supplements as well as reupping on my multivitamins which I ran out of.

The big thing for avoiding wrinkles and spots is SUN SCREEN. Put it on your face if its sunny. Put it on your face if its cloudy. Dont matter. If youve been outside for 2 hours, reapply. Start young. It will make you look like youre 40 when you turn 60.

username#00647,comment,,"OCD is a very misunderstood illness.

To give you a short rundown. OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder. People think this has to do with order and pensils that line up and stuff, but in reality, it's about obsessions and compulsions, and that can be practically anything.

An example was a young woman who experienced very intense images of physical exploitation of children. Everytime she saw a child, she would have a drive to assault this child. It did not make her sexually excited or turned her on in any way. She was extremely repulsed by the thoughts, but they were very intrusive and she almost felt pain from not engaging. In the end, she had an episode where she fell to her knees screaming ""I'd rather die than touch a child! I'd rather die than touch a child!"" over and over again. She didnt know why this was happening. She got admitted to the psychiatric ward and there she was diagnosed with OCD. She got medicine and all these obsessions and compulsions disappeared. 

Now she lives a normal life. OCD is actually a kind of psychotic illness, where you will get an obsession and you will feel a force from inside to act on it. (there's a documentary about this lady on YouTube actually) 

My one other thing I think about with you is how we people can crave food when we are lacking something. Like, do you have a tapeworm? One thing is to crave sugars and fats and junk, as that makes us high and thus we can get addicted. But meats, that's a bit odd. It could either be some sort of obsession and compulsion, but we ***know*** that meats are exactly where you can get parasites and tapeworms. And it's where we get iron. When did you last have a thorough checkup at the doctor?",TrueOffMyChest,1,2022-08-07 05:42:04," OCD is a very misunderstood illness.

Age- 26
Sex- F
Height- 57
Weight- 135
Race- Caucasian 
Duration of complaint- 1.5 years ago 
Location on body- Throat 
Any medical issues- None
Current medication- None (B vitamins, supplements)

This started about a year and a half ago, (it was a very stressful time in my life) my throat started hurting one day like I had scratched it from swallowing something sharp. The next day it felt normal again. I chalked it up to maybe eating sharp chips or stress and/or anxiety because I was having other anxiety related symptoms such as headaches at that time. 

Ever since then, that has happened with my throat about 5 more times since. 

Yesterday it flared up again. It starts with a lump in the throat feeling, turns painful to swallow for a couple of days, then goes away completely and wont happen again for months. 

It doesnt feel like a sore throat from a cold. It almost feels like my throat muscles are super tight and constricted. I even looked at my tonsils this morning with a flashlight and they looked fine. No redness, no swelling, nothing out of the ordinary. 

Ive tried to think back on anything Ive ate or done to cause the pain. I do get occasional tonsil stones that I tried to dig out last weekend. I also felt a tonsil stone in the back of my mouth early this morning when I had just got up. I do eat chips occasionally and I was kind of worried about something yesterday.

I think my biggest problem isnt finding the motivation or time to workout, its more about sticking to healthier eating. Ill be able to make it through the morning and half of the afternoon without too much snacking, but then I end up binging before dinner.

Ill definitely try out your adviceI think I need to break the snacking habit, since its almost like my bodys EXPECTING a huge amount of food right before dinner time.

username#00450,comment,,"Schizophrenia is not a multiple personality disorder, that would be DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder).  Their symptoms overlap, but one is caused by abuse (DID) and the other has a genetic component.  DID also splits or fragments a personality while schizophrenia is a whole unit or ""Singlet"".  It is possible to have DID and Schizophrenia though.

Generally I wake up in the morning and I lay in bed sometimes for a couple hours before I finally get up to empty my bladder, then I sit down on my bed naked and stare down at my feet for a while before finally putting PJ pants and a shirt on, then a few more minutes and I can get my fuzzy slippers on.

Then I stand up, take my meds and drink plenty of water and sit down at my computer.  I generally scroll through YouTube's recommended videos, Netflix, Crackle and other streaming services not able to find anything to watch.  Even TikTok is kinda meh most of the time.  Only a 15 second video?  Eh, scroll past that shit after 1 second.  Someone faking DID?  NEXT! Oh another tourette's faker, scroll.

I've lately also been sitting in the living room on the couch, just casually hitting my vape and just watching my little goldfish swim around and nibble at rocks.

It's been now 3 days since I've been able to get myself to bathe and probably a month since I last flossed and brushed my teeth.  Several months since I shaved.

I have all kinds of food to eat, including cheese pizza that I can simply microwave for a few minutes to eat and even that is too troublesome so I generally just open a can of condensed soup and eat it straight out of the can.  I know it's better to cook it properly with water and all that jazz but I can't be bothered.  Either that or I open a can of fruit to eat or drink a can of creamed corn.

I go to bed late at night, the voices tend to keep me awake.

Anyway, I'm in my 30s, if that makes a difference:

It sounds like she loves you, that's not under question. But, it equally sounds like she is dealing with something in herself - which is not anything a relationship can fix. The ""fix"" has to come from her. Perhaps she wants you to know that she does see a future for you two, but she can't give the kind of energy or focus that is required to be in a relationship *right now*. I don't think she is ""thinking"" about what she feels about you, rather if she can *be* with you.

That being said, the choice is yours: you can choose to wait and love this person perhaps from a distance, because she cannot be with you at this time, or you could find that she does have what is needed in herself to be with you, or you could find that waiting is, as you said, not worth holding on for because it's not going to happen. Any choice is a risk, which you'll need to make if not only for love but also for yourself. What can you deal with? Do you have limits?

username#00731,post,"Ive just lost most, if not all, of my gaming friends because im sure theyre gaslighting me!","So yeah ive just lost pretty much all of my gaming friends, and given that im a social recluse IRL, I basically have nobody now, so thats fun!

Backstory: For the last 10 years or so there was a small group of us on Xbox, and end of last year a few of us moved onto Discord and made a bigger group. As it stands, including me, theres 5/6 on xbox, and 15 on Discord. The Xbox group play every day, and the Discord group once or twice a week or so.

Onto the story: One of the guys from the xbox group and I do not get along. He basically treats me like  a piece of shit 99% of the time. Hes openly said to me that he doesnt value me or my opinions, and has told me to kill myself. He has never once taken responsibility for his actions, and never apologized to me for anything. He is a piece of shit. But its been 10 years, I should be used to this right.

Anyway, other night we're all on Discord, and a minor argument starts. He starts it, gets angry at me, leaves the group, blocks me, refuses to talk to anyone, usual childish bullshit. This would be absolutely fine if it wernt for the fact that everyone else in the group starts blaming me for this argument. Im the one thats kicked off, I need to apologise, blah blah blah. THIS is the catalyst which has snapped me, and made me realize just what a manipulative sociopath this guy is. How he's very easily managed to get people angry at me for something that HE did.

But it gets worse.

One of the group, who wasnt around for the argument, messages me the next day, and rips into me over this. Calls me a child, Im pathetic, I need to grow up. I asked what HE had told them. The basis of their conversation (of which I have screenshots) is that HE got angry, left everything, and its my fault. When confronted about his overreaction, his response was ""Excuse you? If you try to put this on me im going to flip"". So, very clearly this means it MUST be my fault, and I deserve these messages. I lost it, and told them exact who HE is, exactly what HE does, how HE behaves, the full truth. The response? ""I really couldn't care if he's putting on a mask. He's coming across as a nice person. Whether that's the real him or not I don't care. I don't care if this is because of last night. Or because of 10 years worth of feelings you've bottled up. You need to apologize, talk to him about this, and get over it.""

So already Im feeling gaslighted to fuck, but it gets even worse.

We move onto Xbox, today, and im asked by one of that group (who isnt in the Discord) what happened. I explain, and give the same full truth. Response: ""I know. Believe me, we all know. But you know full well we cant do a thing about it"" and off they all went.

So thats it. Im done. Thats all my friends gone. They made their choice, knowing that a manipulative sociopath has outcasted someone from the group. I cant go back to it, because I KNOW its more than ""just banter"". He genuinely sees me as sub-human, and everyone else in both groups is completely fine with that.

username#01082,post,AITA for calling a supervisor over a USPS worker because he was rude to me?,"I needed to find a box to ship a package today on my lunch break. I found a box at work that had product logos and some writing on it. I don't ship boxes often but I knew I probably needed to cover up the markings. I decided to call a postal service number and ask what I specifically needed to do so I could ship this box. When I called I was directed to the USPS number at our local college campus. A nice lady answers and told me I just need to get a sharpie and mark out logos and any writing and I should be fine. Enough enough. 

Once I finished, I drove up to a USPS location closer to me and went inside where I stood in line for awhile. More people started coming in and waited behind me. When I finally got called up, this older man who had been working there for years asked how he could help me. I told him I needed to ship this box. He looks at the box then back at me awkwardly and says ""you know you can't ship this box because of this label right?"" I evidently missed a small logo on the side of the box. I said ""well, the lady at the college USPS location said I needed to mark out the logos and..."" but before I could finish, he interrupts me and rudely announces to the people behind me (literally makes an announcement with a loud voice) ""folks, this girl here is going to listen to an amateur over a professional like me!"" I was shocked. I said ""you know what, forget it."" I grabbed the box, turned around to leave when he shouts ""go back to the college campus!""

I got in my car and was pretty upset and embarrassed how he deliberately tried to humiliate me and make me look stupid. I was trying to do the right thing with the box so it would be easy to just ship it and go, hence why I even tried to call beforehand.

I later found a better box with no markings at all, repackaged it and went back up to the same USPS store. When I walked in, that old man was helping someone else so another lady helped me and shipped the new box no problem. I asked her (with the old man close enough to hear me) if there was a number for a manager or supervisor for this store because of an issue earlier. She said yes and gave me a number that I later called and told my experience. They issued an apology but who knows if they'll even say anything to him at all.

So, with the normal Easter things, thought stopping encouragement, bad Christian rock, as well as a poorly played piano and a one man choir, the pastor said something that didnt sit well with me (aside from all the god bullshit).

Of course he Segwayed into how Jesus like people here to celebrate his return and blah blah blah, but you have to wonder, why count?

Im sorry? Are you so deep with your head up your asshole that the echo of yourself is the only thing you hear? What Atheists have you spoken to? Did you hear their thoughts? Their arguments? Were they 3 years old and unable to formulate an opinion?

I did get some humor out of it though. He mentioned holes in the story I hadnt even thought of, then proceeded to ignore them. He talked about how there was no evidence against Christs resurrection. Also confused Greece and Rome. He used them interchangeably. I heard the phrase The tomb is open, he is risen at least 25 if not 30 times.

username#00643,comment,,"For me it was when my boyfriend (now fiance) from England visited me in the States last year. I was a massive alcoholic and drank every day during the visit, getting absolutely hammered, (as I had been for nine months straight), wasting all my money on booze. I have (diagnosed) schizophrenia and always used booze as a crutch because getting drunk would quiet the voices and numb my anxieties and fears about my delusions, but after he left I realized that towards the end of the trip I hadn't wanted him to see me naked, my skin looked terrible, none of my clothes were fitting anymore, and I was bigger than I had ever been. It took about three weeks after his departure for me to get my act together and quit drinking for good. I weighed myself the next day. 213. 6 at 5'8/f. I figured I might as well start eating healthy too to help drop the weight. I've never been a big eater, even drunk, so portion control wasn't hard for me (the weight was ALLLLLL beer weight - I lost 22.4 pounds my first month), but I immediately switched to eating keto, which I've been sticking to and loving ever since.

The next big changes came about a month later when first, my psychiatrist found an antipsychotic that finally worked REALLY well for me (Caplyta), the fourteenth one I've tried since my diagnosis. I'm now on that and Haldol and it's made a world of difference. I no longer crave alcohol because the meds are doing what it once did for me. My voices are just dull, faint, background noises, my delusions no longer rule my life, my agoraphobia is gone, and I'm generally doing so much better that I'm trying to get a job and get off disability (which I've been on for 4.5 years). Second, I bought a stationary bike off Amazon for $200 and I work out on it every day, seven days a week, for 45 minutes. 

Finally, just two days ago, I decided to add walking to my routine in addition to the biking, and I've done over 10k steps both May 4 and 5, which I plan to continue every day. Before the Caplyta I NEVER would have had the courage to go for hour and a half long walks solo outside. That med really changed my life. I was never that super hyped on the stationary biking (although I'm proud of myself for my consistency over the months and I'm going to continue doing it) but I really see why people love exercise now! I feel great after coming back from a walk! 

Anyway, I'm at 149.2 lbs now, aiming for 135.

All I remember was that it required a log in and you had a personal character. If I remember correctly, you could visit different places and there would be other characters. Specifically I remember a beach scene. Maybe a shopping mall??? 

I also remember that there were mini games. I can only remember one that was either like, create a disease or eradicate a disease or something like that. That screen was outlined in red. 

I also remember that my character could have different hairstyles. I dont know if thats important, but Im trying to remember as much as I can. 
Lastly, for some reason I want to say it had wee in the name. However, I also owned a wii when I was a kid so I could be mixing up memories.

I used to play this game all the time when I was younger and I loved it. Its been driving me crazy for about a year that I cant think of what its called.

But. I was completely broken at 17. I thought all I had lost would be a pit of grief, disease and jealousy. I just wanted what everybody else had. But healing came with time, and some may have been lost, but time is not gone. You have so much time left, and it can be so much better. I wished I'd never been born so many nights, so many days, but healing came. It got better. I'm almost 27 now, and 10 years ago feels like a distant world. I barely recognize the feelings anymore. I sometimes feel pangs of pain. Jealously. Anger. But now, I generally feel good. I feel okay. Love came. Life came. Your childhood does not have to be your only recourse of life. Your inner child can be healed. New love, new memories. Being a adult does not have to limit the idea of growing up with love. You can heal later in life, and thus grow up, finally, with the love you need.

Why are others awarded a bearible life, a lovely childhood, and early success when I was forced to suffer so much of my youth? The time is lost and I will never get it back..

But. I was completely broken at 17. I thought all I had lost would be a pit of grief, disease and jealousy. I just wanted what everybody else had. But healing came with time, and some may have been lost, but time is not gone. You have so much time left, and it can be so much better. I wished I'd never been born so many nights, so many days, but healing came. It got better. I'm almost 27 now, and 10 years ago feels like a distant world. I barely recognize the feelings anymore. I sometimes feel pangs of pain. Jealously. Anger. But now, I generally feel good. I feel okay. Love came. Life came. Your childhood does not have to be your only recourse of life. Your inner child can be healed. New love, new memories. Being a adult does not have to limit the idea of growing up with love. You can heal later in life, and thus grow up, finally, with the love you need. I believe you have a chance of becoming okay ",1,TP,1

Some highly unexpected weight loss overnight - 138.2 lb to 137.4 lb (62.69 kg to 62.32 kg). New low. I'll take it! 

Went to the store yesterday at 6:50 am to get there for their 7 am opening time to buy Greek yogurt. Had it with breakfast to help with my digestive issues (definitely did help and I stayed under 20 g carbs even with the 6 from the yogurt). I got over 3k steps from that and another 1k-odd from puttering around the house in the morning, so I had 4400-ish by the time I got on the walking pad around 9 am and walked up to 10k. I ended the day around 10500 but only because I forgot to put my smartwatch which tracks my steps back on after charging it while walking to buy and mail a Father's Day card downtown or I'd have had more like 14000. 

Yesterday I posted that on Tuesday I had a new personal distance record (in 45 min at the same resistance I've been going at for a while) on the stationary bike. Well, yesterday, just the next day, I topped it with a \*NEW\* PR! Feeling great about that. 

My assisted pushups seem to be coming along. I feel the burn in my muscles and it seems like they're getting a little easier even though I've only been doing them for four days. 

My second kettlebell (26 lb - 12 kg) came yesterday. I haven't started doing anything with them yet. Maybe today!

What I envision: 

Say you are retired. Youve got time. Youve got money. Maybe you have an RV sitting in the driveway. Youd love to take that thing out again, but the driving, the packing, the maintenance, the camp set up, all of that is a total hassle. Too much. 

So, you call a personal concierge. The company hooks you up with a number of people willing to take you on your journey, and do all the hard stuff. Students. Young people. Gig economy types. These folks drive the vehicle, pack the bags, order the food, maybe even make the food, set up your camp or book the hotel room. You get to focus on the fun stuff. 

All of these people are pre-vetted, but you get the final choice from a series of resumes.

Elderly person gets to go on a vacation that he or she otherwise would not have been able to go on. Pays for the personal service. Younger person gets to connect with new person and gain a memorable experience. Gets paid a market rate. Company makes money by brokering the contract, much the same way Airbnb does.

""You're a fringe case and wether or not people have a disposition to having schizophrenia or not can be seen at birth."" 

Yeah, I know and the risk is that no one would know,. No one knew i had it counting me, this is the same with people who has it dormat that no one knows until it presents around 16 - mid twenties (average).

 What i'm getting at is that we shouldnt be treated like weed is good for everyone and that it does 0 harm. Maybe someone who got suggested to try weed to calm themselves down and rid anxiety may start using multiple times a day just to be in that state becaude ehen they feel anxious, they know the weed will help.
Just because you smoke responsibly doesn't mean thats how everyone smokes. 

 Smoking weed is just as bad in respects to lung health as cigarettes. Memory and cognitive function (for some) just get flushed dpwn the drain. You can look that up, and you can probably find more things it can cause. Even if the chance of it happening is a small percentage, it will still effect people out there, maybe not you, but I dont know what you mean by 0 harm.

Weed harmed me, it traumatized me to were if i forget what something is called i feel l like will never get better and it will come back. (Just an example, i have have many more triggers for this) 

Im not saying smoking weed is bad, im saying we need to be more educated and careful talking about these things. I honestly did not start weed because of my will, i started bc the internet was making it sound like a cool thing to do. I would read about people texting really funny stuff to someone whilse high (as posts on media), seeing how it was something that was okay for everyone.

It hurt me, and if my experience and trauma means nothing, you are ignoring everyone else.

username#00432,post,Need to know if I should move back in with my mother,"She.. has a hard time expressing her criticism nicely. As a kid she verbally and physically abused my sister and I. Dated a guy that abused her, he's still at the house but is no longer abusive as far as I know. 

But I'm 23, with Schizophrenia, living in a sober living as a safe place, it is ""dual-diagnosis"" so I can stay here, though I'm not an addict or alcoholic at all.

I've been at the sober living a whole year already, I have no privacy. 14 girls in one house, 4 to a bedroom. It's blahh, it sucks. 

I get SSI for my disability and inability to work full time or part time without having a breakdown.

So I'm working somewhat freelanc-y with a company I used to work full time for, I've worked with 'em 4 years, the boss understands my condition and has not fired me the numerous times I've disappeared for being hospitalized. He always welcomes me back with open arms, and I'm so grateful. 

Trouble is, my rent was being paid by my psychiatrists office, so that I could use my SSI money to settle some debts, and I have done that. So now that I have less debt they want me to start paying $410 for rent and they'll cover the rest(of $700 rent). 

It's fine, they've done so much for me, but I get around $860 a month. I want to save up large chunks so I can live in my own apartment by myself when I'm more stable.. 

The only way to save a lot in a little time is if I move in with my mom, because I'd be paying her only $200 since she lives in a low-incoming apartment. 

I just wish it was clearer. I feel like maybe the problem lies in me. Yes, my mom has been abusive and controlling, but if I step out of my shoes for a moment I can see the intentions clearer, she cares about me. She nags me about my hair and hygiene and appearance because she wants the best for me.

So maybe I gotta step up, realize that she is just a certain way and learn to live with it? 

Should I move back? If things don't work out, people in my sober living come and go ridiculously fast at times, I've been there the longest currently. So I know if I need a different place I can always go back to the sober living. Moving is annoying but that's fine.

Texas didn't just get cold/snow. We've had snow occasionally. Dallas-Fort Worth got record breaking amounts of snow, as did many small surrounding towns. We had no way to plow or de-ice the roads because snow usually lasts one day here, so we're all stuck at home. Not too terrible so far, aside from the lack of food or access to it.

And THEN power went out for millions. For a lot of them, it's been out for four days. Our houses weren't built for cold, so it seeped in. Our houses also weren't built for snow, some people had their roofs collapse due to the snow. Keep in mind these are below freezing temperatures, with windchill that brings it well into the negatives. So we're frozen with no power,  and no way to reach the places that do have power.

And then (there's more) many cities had their water shut off. And they've been without power/water for days. People have died. The areas that didn't lose water were told that they had to boil their water for it to be safe due to contamination. So, those of us without power are also now without water expect for whatever we might have bottled. I've seen people setting small fires on their stove to boil a pot of water. 

It's not us being weak and not used to snow, it's us being in a critical situation. People, pets, and livestock have frozen to death.

username#01090,post,I (25F) think I might be being taken advantage of by a homeless man (?M),"UPDATE 2: He came back and would not leave. I told him first that I could not help him and asked him to go, then that I would call the police if he didnt leave. Then he stayed, so I called the cops. I also told one of my roommates the gist of what happened (the other roommate is away) and she was upset but also quite kind to me. Ive been video chatting with my mom since a half hour after I posted this and started getting your answers and I am attempting to do my reading for my class tomorrow. Well see how that goes, Barthes is hard enough at the best of times. Thank you for your answers.

UPDATE: thank you all for confirming. Im currently going over my actions and realizing just how many mistakes I made because I was scared to say no. Im definitely not going to contact him again beyond a please do not contact me message and probably not even do that. Im gonna tell my roommates what I did and throw myself on their mercy. And Im gonna call the police if I need to.

Hi all. What the title says, I think I might be being taken advantage of but Im worried that I might feel that way bc of prejudice. Please help me sort this out.

Heres the story: Last week I went out for a drink with a classmate and at the end of the night I went back to my place in a lyft and was joined by a guy I met at the bar. I had too much to drink so my memory is fuzzy re: how exactly he ended up there with me but he needed a place to spend the night and we had talked long enough that I felt itd be safe to let him do so. He got up and left after a few hours. Before he left he asked if I could give him any cash. I offered $5 (Im a student and do not have a lot of money, my classmate bought my drinks bc he is nice and it was my birthday the next day) and he said he needed $20. I didnt have any cash so I went to the 711 across the street and I think I ended up giving him $15. We said goodbye; I thought that was the end of it.

Two nights ago he showed up at my apartment at 3:00 in the morning and asked if he could crash for a few hours since he had just seen his friend arrested and was freaked out. I said yes. He stayed until 6 and when he left he again asked for money ($20) saying he would pay me back after I told him I could only give him $5. I gave him $20. He left.

He called me later to say he left his portable phone charger in my apartment. I had to leave and spend the day on campus so I left it with the owner of the corner store (not the 711) and told him someone would be by to pick it up. I called the guy back and left a message saying where he could pick up the charger, but then I got another call saying he had borrowed someone elses phone to call me so he had no way of getting the message.

I got a text today saying that he needed to pick up the charger and I explained what I had done. He said he would be by to pick it up in the afternoon, but then called me at 7 to say he was on his way over. I texted him I was on the bus (bc I was) and have not heard back. I did not ask the corner store guy if the charger has been picked up.

Im wondering what if anything I should do. I know what I want to do, which is ignore him if he comes by looking to crash again, but I dont know if thats because Im being taken advantage of or because Im being selfish.

TLDR: homeless man crashes at my place twice, both times asking me for money I cant really afford to give him. I give him the money, he leaves. Am I being unreasonable or am I being taken advantage of? If its the latter how can I safely end the relationship since he has my phone number and knows where I live?

A portion from the Church of Satan website:

""What does the Church of Satan think about homosexuality?
We fully accept all forms of human sexual expression between consenting adults. The Church of Satan has always accepted gay, lesbian, bisexual and asexual members since its beginning in 1966. This is addressed in the chapter ""Satanic Sex"" in The Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey.

What about gay marriage?
We support the legalization of gay marriage. See this essay by Peter H. Gilmore, ""Founding Family,"" to understand why. Also this essay explores why allowing this civil right to become legal has found resistance.

Does the Church of Satan accept transgender people?
Yes. We have done so since the organization was founded in 1966. The Church of Satan's philosophy promotes individuals empowering themselves so as to seek personal satisfaction. Magus Anton LaVey embraced people from the entire LGTBQ spectrum wholeheartedly-and well in advance of most other religious organizations-and Magus Gilmore proudly maintains that position. We consider it intrinsic to Satanism to support our fellows' search for fulfillment so long as it involves other consenting mature, self-aware adults, even when our own pursuits are different. As Magus LaVey wrote in his essay Diabolica: ""Man prides himself on being the only animal who can modify his Nature, yet when he chooses to do so he is called a phony."" We in the Church of Satan support the decision to modify one's nature employing whatever means are available should one choose that path to attain fulfillment.

I (20F) was talking to my boyfriend (32M) about the idea of applying to Hooters, and when I asked how hed feel about it, he said hed find it icky. I understood his answer, but I pointed out that it seems hypocritical for guys to enjoy places like Hooters or Twin Peaks but then get upset if their partners want to work there.

He said its all about relationships and perspective, arguing that if youre in a relationship, you shouldnt be at Hooters unless your partner is okay with it. I told him that I think its unfair if guys who go to those places even when they were single and stopped after being relationship get to dictate whether their partners can work there when they support those establishments by eating there in the past.

He found my view odd and disagreed, saying just because a guy eats there doesnt mean he supports the jobs there or his gf to work there. He mentioned the guys could be just going there for the food not for the girls. I said that if youre going there knowing what its about and advertised as, youre supporting it. It feels hypocritical to enjoy the restaurant but not want your partner to have the same opportunity to be a worker.

Weve been going back and forth on this, and Im feeling frustrated. I know I might not be completely right, but I think I have a point. AITA for being upset about his reaction?

Unfortunately it gets tossed around way too much now and has kinda killed the legitimacy of it, which sucks because I've identified as demisexual since I learned the term in 2010ish. The basic thing is: you experience zero attraction to people without a deep emotional connection. Like a stranger is never hot to you. Or an acquaintance. It's like being gay and everyone else thinks this person of the opposite gender is smoking hot, and you...just don't see it. It does nothing for you. Once you become close friends with someone, it's like a door cracks open. You might find the attractive, you might not. I liked it because I could never identify with people who said things like, ""oh he's cute"" about some random dude. 


And then it turned into ""you can be demisexual and experience attraction to people! You're still demisexual if you have an ONS with a hot stranger! You're still valid if you experience aesthetic attraction to random people!"" And suddenly I was back to not being able to relate with anyone.

When i call her out, her arms stretch down the floor and she turns kinda goopy. Either that or shell just sends millions of tiny roach like insects to wiggle their way into the space under your skin but above the muscle and layer of fat. She sounds so melodic, like an angel ringing a bell. However the things she says are my past traumas over and over and over and over again. Ugh I hate her",1,TP,1

Lunch (1pm): Some rice, a little more cheese, avocado, dried raisins, second half of banana

username#01230,comment,,"My uncle who is a farmer posted this link on facebook and I was curious as.to if its true or not. Comtents of link: I have to admit, I melt at the creaminess of full-fat yogurt. It's an indulgence that we're told to resist. And I try to abide. (Stealing a bite of my daughter's YoBaby doesn't count, does it?) The reason we're told to limit dairy fat seems pretty straight forward. The extra calories packed into the fat is bad for our waistlines. That's the assumption. But what if dairy fat isn't the dietary demon we've been led to believe? New research suggests we may want to look anew. Consider the findings of two recent studies that conclude the consumption of whole fat dairy is linked to reduced body fat. In one paper, published by Swedish researchers in the Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care, middle-aged men who consumed high-fat milk, butter and cream were significantly less likely to become obese over a period of 12 years compared to men who never or rarely ate high-fat dairy. Yep, that's right. The butter and whole-milk eaters did better at keeping the pounds off. ""I would say it's counter-intuitive,"" says Greg Miller, executive vice president of the National Dairy Council. The second study, published in the European Journal of Nutrition, is a meta-analysis of 16 observational studies. There has been a hypothesis that high-fat dairy foods contribute to obesity and heart disease risk, but the reviewers concluded that the evidence does not support this hypothesis. In fact, the reviewers found that in most of the studies, high-fat dairy was associated with a lower risk of obesity. ""We continue to see more and more data coming out [finding that] consumption of whole-milk dairy products is associated with reduced body fat,"" Miller says. It's not clear what might explain this phenomenon. Lots of folks point to the satiety factor. The higher levels of fat in whole milk products may make us feel fuller, faster. And as a result, the thinking goes, we may end up eating less. Or the explanation could be more complex. ""There may be bio-active substances in the milk fat that may be altering our metabolism in a way that helps us utilize the fat and burn it for energy, rather than storing it in our bodies,"" Miller says. Whatever the mechanism, this association between higher dairy fat and lower body weight appears to hold up in children, too.As we reported last year, a study of children published in the Archives Of Diseases in Childhood, a sister publication of the British Medical Journal, concluded that low-fat milk was associated with more weight gain over time. ""It really surprised us,"" study author Mark DeBoer, a pediatrician at the University of Virginia, told us. So, where does this leave us, the rule-followers, who have complied with the skim-milk-is-best edict? Well, opinions differ. The recommendations that led to the fat-free dairy boom were, in part, born out of concerns about cholesterol. Whole-milk dairy products are relatively high in saturated fat. And eating too much saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease. So many experts would agree that adults with high cholesterol should continue to limit dairy fat. But it's also becoming clear that there are benefits to full-fat dairy too, at least for some consumers. As we've reported, in addition to the body weight association, organic whole milk contains beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. It's unclear whether more people are opting for whole milk products. Though non-fat and low-fat are still dominating dairy sales, the organic sector is experiencing an uptick in whole-fat sales. ""We definitely in the last few years are seeing a trend toward the whole fat products,"" George Siemon, CEO of the farmer-owned Organic Valley, told us. His company's sales of whole-fat milk are up 10 percent, he says. And sales of skim milk have trailed off. Also, there's been a boom in butter sales. So, stay tuned. Though it's a sounds-too-good-to-be-true finding, researchers are continuing to investigate how dairy fat may help people control their weight.
",AskReddit,0,2014-02-13 09:48," My uncle who is a farmer posted this link on facebook and I was curious as.to if its true or not. Comtents of link: I have to admit, I melt at the creaminess of full-fat yogurt. It's an indulgence that we're told to resist. And I try to abide. (Stealing a bite of my daughter's YoBaby doesn't count, does it?) The reason we're told to limit dairy fat seems pretty straight forward. The extra calories packed into the fat is bad for our waistlines. That's the assumption. But what if dairy fat isn't the dietary demon we've been led to believe? New research suggests we may want to look anew. Consider the findings of two recent studies that conclude the consumption of whole fat dairy is linked to reduced body fat. In one paper, published by Swedish researchers in the Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care, middle-aged men who consumed high-fat milk, butter and cream were significantly less likely to become obese over a period of 12 years compared to men who never or rarely ate high-fat dairy. Yep, that's right. The butter and whole-milk eaters did better at keeping the pounds off. ""I would say it's counter-intuitive,"" says Greg Miller, executive vice president of the National Dairy Council. The second study, published in the European Journal of Nutrition, is a meta-analysis of 16 observational studies. There has been a hypothesis that high-fat dairy foods contribute to obesity and heart disease risk, but the reviewers concluded that the evidence does not support this hypothesis. In fact, the reviewers found that in most of the studies, high-fat dairy was associated with a lower risk of obesity. ""We continue to see more and more data coming out [finding that] consumption of whole-milk dairy products is associated with reduced body fat,"" Miller says. It's not clear what might explain this phenomenon. Lots of folks point to the satiety factor. The higher levels of fat in whole milk products may make us feel fuller, faster. And as a result, the thinking goes, we may end up eating less. Or the explanation could be more complex. ""There may be bio-active substances in the milk fat that may be altering our metabolism in a way that helps us utilize the fat and burn it for energy, rather than storing it in our bodies,"" Miller says. Whatever the mechanism, this association between higher dairy fat and lower body weight appears to hold up in children, too.As we reported last year, a study of children published in the Archives Of Diseases in Childhood, a sister publication of the British Medical Journal, concluded that low-fat milk was associated with more weight gain over time. ""It really surprised us,"" study author Mark DeBoer, a pediatrician at the University of Virginia, told us. So, where does this leave us, the rule-followers, who have complied with the skim-milk-is-best edict? Well, opinions differ. The recommendations that led to the fat-free dairy boom were, in part, born out of concerns about cholesterol. Whole-milk dairy products are relatively high in saturated fat. And eating too much saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease. So many experts would agree that adults with high cholesterol should continue to limit dairy fat. But it's also becoming clear that there are benefits to full-fat dairy too, at least for some consumers. As we've reported, in addition to the body weight association, organic whole milk contains beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. It's unclear whether more people are opting for whole milk products. Though non-fat and low-fat are still dominating dairy sales, the organic sector is experiencing an uptick in whole-fat sales.

username#01082,post,Late period due to stress or pregnancy and I am freaking,"I got off of birth control about 5 months ago and have had regular periods since. I don't see my fiance often due to his line of work so when I do, we get it on, safely. 

He was home for awhile and left about a week ago. My period was supposed to come about 5 or 6 days ago (give or take) and still nothing. I have been super stressed with work and his work so that may be the culprit. However, my periods were still coming regular even with stress the last few months. This past month was more stressful though.

I mentioned our safe sex. We use condoms but are bad about waiting a few minutes (sometimes even halfway in) to put them on. That is what is concerning me the most.

I have yet to take a pregnancy test out of fear, but plan to soon. I know that will be my only way of knowing but it helps to vent!

username#01226,post,Worried about having loose skin? Take up a prevention method today.,"One of my biggest worries about losing this weight is all the excess skin I'll have to deal with when my journey is complete. I've lost over 150 pounds once before and the amount of skin I had left over was absolutely horrid. I looked all Jabba the hutish. Whelp I regained all of the poundage back plus more so I figured this time I would try to nip this problem in the butt before I'm nothing but a pile of loose skin when I am done.

With the daily routine I am doing every day now I can already tell a huge difference from the previous time I lost the weight. I dry brush my skin after I wake up, shower while applying coconut oil and afterwards I use a skin firming lotion. I repeat the process again before I go to bed. I'm sure any lotion will do but the skin firming was on sale. Also I'm not sure if the coconut oil is adding towards the firming process, but I like the way it makes my skin and hair feel and how its brings out the inner woman from within me (I'm a guy). My underarms and stomach which were/are my two biggest problem areas seem to be shrinking in not only fat but there doesn't seem to be as much skin hanging as there was before. We will see how I look when I am at my goal weight and I don't expect all of my skin to be all tight but hopefully it will make a significant difference. 

I can't guarantee you will have the same results as I am, but I thought I would share since I know this is a big concern for people like me that also have a fuck load of poundage to lose. If you are going to do it I would at least do the dry brush since its cheap and easy. You can find some tips on dry brushing online that you should follow and don't use a synthetic brush, them shits hurt.

I'm 23, go to school(one class at a time...) and work part-time as a graphic designer at a small web design company. 

I've been diagnosed with Schizophrenia for the past 2 years. It's been really really rough. Voices on and off.. delusions.. it's been like a nightmare. It gets better sometimes, and it'll be nice and I won't notice how good things are until they get worse again.

It's just mostly bad. I just want to live a good life and I'm starting to see my limitations.. I do get disability/SSI, and now I actually feel disabled. Because the stress of attempting to work more than part-time or to take more than one class at a time sends me into a terrible psychotic episode that lands me in the hospital. 

I hate feeling this way. Limited. I would like to be an illustrator, or do freelance graphic design and be able to support myself instead of living with roommates.. but I don't know if that will ever happen.

I'm feel stupid. Behind on life compared to others my age. 

I don't know how to be successful. I have these plans.. like, maybe I should move out of my group home and go back with my mom who is unsupportive, for cheaper rent and my own room again. Or maybe move in with stranger roommates instead of this group home that's actually a sober living but ""dual-diagnosis"" so mentally ill people can live here. 

I just don't know what's best for me. And I'm really really afraid of doing the wrong thing. 

Just last week I wasn't sure if any of the world around me was real, because I was experiencing severe depersonalization and ""delusions"" as they're considered. I'm still not sure. Not sure if I should end my 'verse with suicide or not.

username#00468,comment,,"Unfortunately it's not that easy. Other countries never had openly flowing guns the way the US has. 
There are more guns than people here and those are only the guns we know about. The US also has a lot of criminal activity (the cartels, larger criminal organizations), mostly in the southern most states and believe me they will profit majorly on firearms, just like they profit so much from drugs. 

Also, not to mention the fact that criminals don't follow the law. You can outlaw stuff all you want, but a criminal is a criminal, they don't follow the rules. 
You can't just suddenly make more than 300,000,000+ guns disappear, or suddenly take those way. 

I do agree that we need to get stricter on all of this stuff. It doesn't make sense that you need to be 21 to drink, or smoke, but you can buy a firearm, and join the military at 18. I think that that alone is insane, but for some reason no one bats an eye. I can be fresh out of high-school and purchase a long gun, but god forbid I grab a beer. 

Another issue is Healthcare, and mental health services are expensive, and a lot more taboo here. A lot of these kids need mental help. No normal 16 year old decides they want to kill others. Parents need to talk to their kids, and bullies need to have actual consequences. I don't know if you've looked into it, but bullying is more present in the US than almost all other western countries. Bullys in other countries seem to actually get jn trouble for their harassment. Here in the US the victim needs to stand up for themselves before the school actually gets involved which is absolute bullshit. 

Then there are the ""clout-shooters"" shooters that do it just for the purpose of being ""known"", again this is a mental health issue. Who in their right mind would want to be ""known"" in this way. Same as the Tumblr girls who fantasize school shooters, and serial killers. 

Also not to mention, even stricter background checks. I understand background checks now are considered strict, but let's be honest, most likely an 18 year old entering the criminal world isn't gonna have an existing record yet, which is why I believe they should push all legal gun purchases up to 21, and maybe set the drinking age back to 18. Just feels like the people have their priorities backward.

My boyf doesn't say it back every time. He says it every now and then, and it always holds a lot of weight, because he says it in lovey situations and it happily surprises me when he does. I don't mind that he doesn't say it all of the time. 

It's basically a difference in love language; while I might just say 'i love you' he might say 'stay safe.' 

I would definitely have a conversation with him about this. Maybe tell him this is how you mainly express love and while his love language might be different, this is yours.

username#00432,post,Should I go back to my old job?,"I'm 23, female with Schizophrenia. 

I worked for the past 4 years as a Graphic Designer for a Web Design/Marketing company. This was my first and so far only job that I've ever done. I got lucky, my passion was made clear during my unpaid internship at the company and they knew they wanted me. 

I have left the company a few times for health reasons, being Schizophrenic. I've been hospitalized a few times during work and my boss has been nothing but understanding. He's always told me to take the time I need and I'm welcome to come back any time. 

In March I left the company after a two week hospitalization for a suicide attempt. 

I don't *need* the money. I'm ok without it, I've adjust ed to be without it and the money I get from the government for my mental health disability is ok, I can live off that.

But damn, my life has no *purpose*! I'm doing a bit of freelance but it's going slow. I'd like to be able to save money for a future but I can't on government funds. 

The job can be stressful, but I've always loved it. It's always given me the sense of power I crave. I was in charge of interns and project management and talking to programers from India at 8 AM to work on website mistakes. 

There was always a rush that came from the meetings and servers going down and social media events for our clients.

It made me feel *amazing*. And now I'm nothing. I'm an attempting freelancer. Barely getting any extra money. I wasn't making major funds at the job($12/hr) but it was good enough because I got to work with great people. 

I'm just scared to go back and fail again, I'm scared to go back and then end up in a mental hospital AGAIN and have to leave AGAIN. 

I want to be more reliable than I am. But the illness holds me back, limits me. 

Should I go back to my old job? My boss will definitely welcome me, as he told me this last time that I left. I'll always have a place there. 

Or should I spend my time going to group therapy at my doctor's office and focus on recovery? 

I'm doing pretty good now, the medication I'm on has me feeling healthier. But that can change at any time and so I'm scared about working...

When I was at my skinniest, completely different people were into that. But there's always someone who'll find your body the peak of sexy if you just put yourself out there.",1,TP,1

My friends and I were OBSESSED with this in college. We would watch it and quote it all the fucking time.

It's not only hysterical and ridiculous, it's also one of the first and longest running inside jokes I have with two of my college friends.
