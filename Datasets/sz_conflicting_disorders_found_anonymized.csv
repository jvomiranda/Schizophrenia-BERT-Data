I don't really know the definition, can't really tell you because high functioning may be different for everyone. Some people can live normal lives, and are consider high functioning I guess, but positive symptoms may affect them in some way still.

I guess some can consider having schizophrenia is like being on a spectrum depending on the severity of your positive symptoms. I know how severe my positive symptoms use to be, and I've been able to recover alot over the years, but still have episodes and negative symptoms.

My functionality fluctuates alot depending on what my episodes does to me. And I find I'm affected by seasonal changes too. Probably taking care of your health like with exercise helps to become more functional as well.

Edit: If I were on antipsychotics I would definitely not be high functioning at all, because of how the side affects contributes to having more negative symptoms as well.

username#00402,post,1495416178.0,My friends making assumptions about how I should be when I'm unwell.,"I think a major issue with how other people perceive us is that they expect us to be really sad when we're unwell.

On May 1st, after 2 months of worsening symptoms, not eating & paranoia to the extent where I couldn't leave my room, I was advised by tutors and my mental health advisor that I should forget about university work and return home for a while.
(I want to add that during this time my flatmates showed no support or compassion while I was in this state of not eating/washing/isolating myself)

Since I've been gone, those on my group project (two of which are also my flatmates) have had to get on without me. In my defence the only input I have at this stage is my opinion on the edit of the film however I do feel bad that I've had to drop it for the past 3 weeks. The project is due 3 days after I return to uni next week so I'll have minimal input then.

From the messages on Facebook I've been getting from them I get the vibe that the group is angry that I've taken a break to get better. I posted a photo on social media that someone took of me smiling on the beach and I know they're going to think ""oh it's well for him having fun when we're stressed out finishing the project"". I just hate how people think they know how I should act when I'm unwell. If they bothered to know me at all they'd know that I have mania a lot more than I have depression. 

This is quite a rant. I'm just pissed off that I go through a lot with daily hallucinations and delusions and for people to make assumptions that things are easy for me and it's all good because I'm relaxing right now. And even though I'm trying to recover from the recent episode I've had they still pester me with things they could easily do themselves. ""Can you send me a list of the cast who were in the film?"". That information is available to them. It's written everywhere. It's as if they don't even believe that I've been ill. 

I don't know. I'm not looking forward to going back because I hate to feel like I'm being judged. Especially since I've worked my arse off for the whole year, even taking on other people's roles and just because it finally got too much I'm being made feel guilty for having to take a break.",schizophrenia,i have\s*(mania),

I have a really hard time with not wanting people to ever see me lose my marbles. I try to contain it as much as possible because I guess I fear that if the people I loved seen me at my worst they'd think differently about me, write me off as a hopeless case and leave me. 

Regardless I know that this hasn't really been the case. I've cried to people on the phone in frustration because I couldn't understand why the TV was sending me messages. I've apologised again and again for getting myself into trouble when I was psychotic. I often feel the urge to tell people just how much it means to me that they've stuck around.

username#00407,comment,1679926337.0,,"It can be very hard dealing with someone on medication in a psychosis. It can feel very isolating and thankless. Be proud of yourself for the support you've been and are providing.

&#x200B;

Have you ever evaluated the medication and it's dosage? Medication that treats psychosis can sedate, blunt emotions and sap energy.

When I was first medicated I became incredibly disinterested and sleepy. When a friend's father died she just wanted some support, and not be alone. But after some time, I just said something along the line of: ""Are you done talking? I want to continue my nap.""

Gradually decreasing dosage or switching medication, might help. It's best to find the minimum dose at which it's still effective, but has the fewest side-effects. Talk about this with a doctor/psychiatrists or other medical care provider.

&#x200B;

Beyond that what helped me is when barriers to do something and open up were as low as possible. I was in a confused state most of the time and had avolition (no, initiative/motivation), so planning and organising was something I could not do. I did have ideas for things to do, but could not actually execute it.

There are things I like to do but unable to get myself to do them. Doing it with friends helped. I went on walks, played games, or drew together with friends. Find something you both like and do it together. When doing something together you don't necessarily need to talk much but it does keep you feel connected.

Eventually my friends and me made set appointments. Things like: every thursday we call each other; every month we do x together. So I did not have to *think* about meeting up or keeping in touch, it was already set.

Or friends and family would just tell me when, where and what we were going to do; often picking me up so I did not have to go to them myself. 'On x date, we'll go walking in x nature park, make sure you wear x clothes, bring a lunch, I'll pick you up at x 'o clock, etc.' I kind of felt like a young child whose parents make all their appointments and decisions. But again it lessened how much of my coordination and planning was required.

It can still be hard for you, and feel unfair, as you put in all the effort for someone unable to show appreciation. But It may allow your partner to be a bit more active, physically and mentally and keep you non-verbally connected.

Initially I communicated poorly when doing things together with friends, but it gradually got better. My communication stayed on practical things pertaining to the activity for some time. But it gradually allowed me to talk about other things, and eventually about myself and actually talk to my friends.",schizophrenia,my\s*(communication),

username#01254,comment,1540241206.0,,"I found out I had Bipolar II around 2012 when I was still active duty, I think. This past February I was diagnosed with BPD. Once my psychiatrist confirmed exactly my feelings, thoughts and the fact my husband performed marital rape on me, I felt numb for the first several minutes. It wasn’t until I was waiting to pick up my prescriptions (at the VA) right after until it all hit me at once and I broke down in silence.

My (first and current) marriage feels like a sham. All my previous relationships feel like they were more reasons for me to be left alone. Every occurrence has been involved in a r*pe, sexual harassment or a combination of the both. I’ve always been a person to see the “good” in others but the more I think on that, I see I stretch that concept so thin that it’s unhealthy. My BPD in my last relationship deemed because we were together 6 years, it was time for us to get married. I thought I could turn a boy into a grown man. Ha. Learned the hard way when he forced himself on me, although I did run away and never looked back.

I believe my BPD forced me into my current relationship because my partner had this “super hero” stance after my ex raped me. We were both active duty and wanted to live off post, so that was the accelerant for us to proceed. Long story short, I always regret this relationship because I felt I rushed into it but at the same time I just couldn’t say no. I could never understand why I felt this way and it was literally eating me alive.

I am not happy but I am trying to make peace with myself. Out of this marriage I have a toddler so he is my world. It’s scary, rough and greyscale now that me and my husband are currently trial separated (I suppose) but I haven’t had the urge to kill myself or anything radically serious. However, I know the illness is real because I still get episodes. I’m going through one now and the worst of it is me being so physically tired, depressed and having mild auditory hallucinations.

Currently, I have long term goals to continue college. Short term goals are to begin a hobby collecting houseplants for my apartment and to look into meditation more. I utilize the Pacifica app and Headspace thanks to a sister that was nice enough to purchase a membership and share.

have you tried disabling voice chat or the text team chats and just playing with your intuition and pings? i've gotten far in multiplayer fps games with that & some music to keep me calm. 

i try to remember too when people rage or lose their temper, a vast majority of people using video games both for pleasure and for escapism tend to be on the more introverted end. i certainly started out that way in my time online growing up (before getting a bit more of a hold on myself & discovering that i'm actually super extroverted and love to meet new people!)

while it's good that spaces exist where people who are shy or don't have as many irl opportunities to socialize exist, it also definitely attracts people who are substituting games for their sense of self and stability and react poorly on others when they do anything other than fill the script for you in their mind. 

it ALSO means it attracts people who are aware that they won't receive any real consequences for their behavior. why would they care, when a new account costs twenty bucks or whatever? 🙄 
many of them i suspect ran out of people who tolerated their abusive communication in real life, and it now follows them into the virtual sphere as well.

unfortunately all of that stuff coalesces into the potential to run into some real rude people. 
judicious use of the block button, realizing that these people CANNOT harm you through the screen, and taking breaks is typically how i deal with flare-ups from people being rude on games and in online spaces in general. 

finding groups of people to play with who are like you, interested in the stuff you are, or have the same goals in games is easier than ever now too! 
every mmo or fps i've played has had groups/clans specifically for anxious players, specifically for women, specifically for the gays; wherever you feel like you'd fit in, being part of a group like that will mean that if anyone is weird, there will at least be (hopefully!) some modicum of punishment by that person not being around anymore, etc. 
it also means safety in numbers, if you happen to encounter a rude person.

username#00418,post,1694499423.0,I am not respected.,"I hate everyone. My little sister just barged into my room just to use my mobile hotspot while I was sleeping. I told her many times that she can't open my door like that especially when I'm sleeping. 

I have tourette's and I'm unmedicated for the time being and if I wake up without proper sleep then my tics get really really bad. I'm also sick currently and still recovering yet she can't respect me because being online is more important that my wellbeing. 

Everytime she does something disrespectful to me she blames her ADHD even though I don't see her doing this to anyone else. She always says that I use my autism to get away with things when I don't, the only times I use it as an explanation is when I explode on her or say things she finds rude and I always apologise. 

I don't dare speak when she is sleeping or knock on her door yet she always opens my door like I don't have a life too. This is making me so angry and I'm scared of having a meltdown. I hate this so much. Nobody respects me and I hate this a lot.",AutisticPeeps,my\s*(autism),X

My sister who is my caretaker has SPD and even though she tells me to let my tics just happen and stim freely, she leaves when I do that because it annoys her so much.

I had a fight with her as I told her to go live her life outside of our miserable house bur she said ahe wouldn't leave unless she was with me. She will get her first paycheck in 3 months and will take me with her to a new apartment. She said that she won't leave me but even if we leave together we won't be able to hang out without any of us feeling uncomfortable. She can't handle the noise and I make so much noise. She can't handle seeing me rock back and forth so I have to hold everything in. She said that she never asked me to do that but if I don't then how are we supposed to sit together? We both have different sensory needs and it's the complete opposite of eachother.

username#01255,post,1589304496.0,"Today I learned why I ask if people are mad. (Comorbid things, thoughts? Sorry it is a ramble).","Some back information, I have schizoaffective and borderline personality disorder as my main diagnoses.

I used to think it was a bpd thing for me to ask if people are mad at me when they're different, because that can be a BPD thing. However, I did further self reflection and realized it is deeper than that. Yes, I can perceive people as angry from a neutral expression. But it's not anger that's my first thought, but it's usually what I default in asking.

Today I learned when I ask someone if they are mad at me, it is not because I genuinely think they're mad. It's because they're acting different and I feel like they may be an imposter trying to get to me. It's just more socially acceptable to ask if they are mad or tired rather than accusing or asking that out right. It's sneaky how my brain tries to cover it all up.

Like I do things and say things just in case entities are listening and watching, but I hide it. I prod people sometimes discretely to see what's up. I also used to have a thing where I couldnt act out against the voices/entities in public because I knew a silent alarm would go off and they'd come fo me. In the worst of my psychosis, the filter broke though and I could no longer keep my composure. It's crazy how much my brain is sneakily trying to hide things. The only thing that's hard for me to hide is poor hygeine though, but that's better sometimes than others.

Can anyone relate?

It's strange how having these things comorbid, they're meshed together. One can camouflage the other, when they are working together against me. 

Does anyone else have secondary/comorbid disorders? If so, how do you think they fuel each other? 

I also have a hoarding disorder and OCD type symptoms but it's part of my schizoaffective moreso and did not warrant a formal diagnosis of OCD i think. I am a checker, and I used to have to check if my door is locked up to 12 times a day, more from the inside too which if I'm at home shouldnt he a problem in normal people. I'm also extremely paranoid of fire to the point where when I saw a firetruck in another city I was terrified that my house was on fire. I used to be able to throw out garbage and struggles with things that meant something cryptically to me, but because of my major paranoia I had stopped throwing out garbage too, resulting in my apartment being tended to by a deep cleaning organization. Part of this also is not the hoarding by itself, but the fact I have poor executive functioning. 

My BPD thrives on routine, but my sza makes following a proper/beneficial routine really hard. 

The hoarding issue never got better, only worse. But my injections (invega trinza) helped my other obsession/compulsions and effexor helped when I was on that too permanently I feel as I no longer take effexor. I still pick at myself obsessively though (dermatillomania and acne excoriation).

I was just wondering, as well, if it's common for schizoaftective depressive to become schizoaftective bipolar type 2.

I just feel the high I experienced was too much for bpd. I know none of you are doctors but I'm genuinely curious.

I spoke really fast, was very talkative and unafraid to tell people off. I felt like I was on drugs (as I'm a past substance user) like meth. I walked fast and felt I couldn't come down. I did some socially unacceptable things which I felt I couldn't stop myself. It happened before to a lesser degree but this time around was the worst it's been. 

I went back to being depressed, then to a middle ground as I find my antidepressant to be effective, so I never get as low for as long as my depressive episodes lasted in the past.

I am still self distructive in my impulsivity (spending, eating at times, anger) even though I no longer self harm (cutting, for me).

I don't really fear abandonment as much anymore but that could be because I don't get close with anyone new and try to push the people I am close with away at times.

I have two conditions, and their comorbidity can be controversial to some psychiatrists but all I have seen as an adult agree I have both, as far as I know. I am diagnosed with schizoaffective depressive type and borderline personality disorder. So it's difficult for me, determining if the depressive side is due to my borderline and I actually just have schizophrenia or if the psychotic illness is schizoaffective. My psychotic symptoms aren't transient and can be more severe and I have other symptoms which is how it was determined I did fit the criteria for a schizo illness.

 I really only had one severe and long depressive episode but it was shortly after getting diagnosed and them telling me the beliefs I had for many years were all delusions meaning I wasted my life. I have now been off antidepressants for years and never experienced the same thing ever again like that depressive episode. So I really think all the things I thought were depression before it, and the things I experience after it, were all just negative symptoms. Idk.

username#00420,post,1668163929.0,Mania the good the bad and the ugly,"I have to say sometimes my mania can be a good thing. Being able to conquer fears being the only good thing. I'm talking being able to go to the dentist, but not only that, getting the process started for fixing my teeth after years and years of neglect. But not only that having an emergency tooth removal with only some numbing and a yank. Something I could never do and any dentistry was strictly under general anaesthesia. If only I could have the benefits like these without the negatives like impulsive spending and shit that's detrimental like drug use/abuse and risky behaviours. Something else I conquered recently was getting the COVID jabs without fainting and being a big boi. That alone is a huge feat for me, but then I also was like fuck it I'm getting a bloodtests for the first time in a decade. Went in and got full bloods done without fainting. You know your boi treated himself with a maccys hotcakes and frappe for brekky that morning. Just thought I'd post now the numbing agent has worn off and I don't look like I had a stroke. Booked in to get wisdom teeth removed in a month. Which is under anaesthesia but I'm glad I got one other tooth removed to know what the process after is like. Basically helping remove any anxiety. Plus the poor dentist had to drill and hammer and pull out all the bloody tools to get this one tooth out so I know if I need work, as long as they numb and don't go too far back with the tools I'll be sweet. Popping a valium might've helped. I'm not sure. But I went safe and took a 2mg tab just in case. Only meant for sleep but because it was under the guidance of the dentist he was happy to provide a note saying yea had to get tooth removed and op took 1 2mg tab just to help.

Ie going from daily migraines and headaches, maxing Panadol and aspiran, to maybe a full headache daily, and monthly migraines that last a few hours. I also take Candesartan and an injection called ajovy for my migraines. But the headaches are like pop 2 Panadol and the headaches are gone and won't be back for 8 to 12 hours. 

The Cymbalta was ineffective for my mental health. As in it didn't make things worse, or make things better. I just got diagnosed with bipolar so chances are I'll need to have an antipsychotic/mood stabilizer instead of antidepressant for my mental health to be less severe. However being on Cymbalta was never detrimental to my mental health. If you feel like you can get through the weening off of Effexor and the initial normal side effects of starting Cymbalta, I'd recommend giving it a shot.

I have spoken with debtors, If I get into a big pickle where I need money for food, or fuel, I can call the bank of the unsecured loan and zippay for deferrals from repayments like I have with the bigger secured loan. This will atleast ensure I can pickup a week's worth of 2 min noodles to survive. 

The car is a Hyundai i30 active 2021. I just commented on another commenter with the issues Im struggling with, but basically I don't meet lending criteria to get a debt or credit card to cover the shortfall, the car yard can't buy the car with the shortfall covered, same with a private buyer, the bank is saying you need to cover the shortfall, and the car is getting offers of 25k privately, 20 to 23k at a car yard. I do not have a support network that I can call upon to assist me during this time. If I did I'd be wanting to basically ask them right before declaring bankruptcy in the first place. 

The financial counsellor said for the amount of assets and debt currently, it's not a bad thing to start fresh, it's not ideal but it's not the end of the world. I'm young and can use it as a massive learning opportunity. The other thing is I can voluntarily surrender my car to the bank, and then I work out a repayment plan based on the remaining amount. I can then if the debt is significant (the car sells for under $15k leaving me with a $13+K debt) I voluntarily enter bankruptcy clearing all 3 unsecured debts. I'd like to point out I do not want to, but each time I pick up the phone I'm edging one step closer due to something unable to be achieved. I might sound a bit blasé but it's just because I'm so exhausted from this.

For example, we thought we all developed around age 21, and only a few months ago found out 80% of us have been around before age 10, and 50% of us before age 5! 

Also, ""amnesia"" refers to traumatic amnesia, too. You literally don't need to forget normal days for it to count as annesia. If you've literally ever forgotten a traumatic experience, that counts. Not being able to remember how you were thinking or feeling during an event also counts. Remembering only ""most of"" an event counts. Not remembering who you were/who was fronting absolutely, 100% counts as amnesia. Not only does the confusing nature lead to distress as people incorrectly believe themselves to be ""faking,"" but also nobody seems to explain what they mean when talking about what happens. 

What you described is called passive influence. Sometimes, alters ""flavor"" you a bit. It's super duper common, I honestly haven't heard of a single system (DID/OSDD or not) who hasn't experienced passive influence. And again, the lack of information about DID/OSDD causes distress.

My stimulants affected me positively (concerta at first, Adderall for a brief stint, then Vyvanse), and helped with my negative symptoms that have always been my biggest struggle since my schizophrenia developed around ages 10-15. I've always responded typically to stimulants, in a very textbook way, and that combined with just generally fitting most every common ADHD experience means I have full confidence, yes I do have co-morbid ADHD and schizophrenia. 

In contrast, I was diagnosed with autism when I was 16, and have always doubted it, because why did I suddenly ""become autistic"" in the past few years? And while I've identified with autistic experiences, they were always ADHD or schizophrenic experiences, too. I've just realized I got off topic, I'm so sorry, let me try again. 

I have been off stimulants for most of my 20s, and my positive symptoms have actually gotten worse. But there's also a lot of scientific evidence that suggest the 20s is just a time where some people's brains get worse, so I wouldn't necessarily say they're related, but you're free to draw your own conclusions. I never really noticed my positive symptoms being better or worse on days I would forget my stimulant, but I also only recently realized my ""eyes playing tricks on me"" constantly have been hallucinations, so my memory may not be reliable. Not the greatest data, but it's data, yeah? My psychosis is constant, but so are my negative symptoms, and I've honestly never struggled with my psychosis as much as the negative symptoms. But I've also supposedly been hallucinating since I was 10 or something, so maybe I just learned to cope. 

The potential connection between ADHD and schizophrenia is fascinating though, as is the one between bipolar and schizophrenia.

I used to really struggle with staying on topic when talking or even thinking. It made things very difficult for others to understand me but also for me to understand others. When I was first assessed, I had a three hour interview about my experiences and part of that length was probably related to my communication difficulties.

Like you, I also experienced delusions. I also experienced hallucinations, but I know those aren't required for a diagnosis. Another symptom, which affects roughly half of people with schizophrenia, is called anosognosia, which means lack of insight into your illness. People with schizophrenia are often inhibited from understanding that they are sick in any way or from accepting a diagnosis. Think of it this way: if you break your arm, a signal is sent to your brain which tells you that you are hurt and that you might need help, but if there is a break in your brain, then there might not really be a place to send the signal to tell you there is something wrong.

What I really want to say, though, is this: we are not psychiatrists, and even if we were, reading your posts on reddit isn't a great way to get a read on somebody and make a diagnosis, so we can't tell you whether you have disorganized schizophrenia. That psychiatrist who has been suspecting it for the past 2 years, though? He has had lots of time to get to know you and your struggles and is probably the most qualified person in the world at this very moment to make such a diagnosis. I know it can be hard to accept. I know you can feel all alone when thinking about all this. But you are not alone.

One thing that really helped me was knowing that my diagnosis had a label. If something has a label that people throw around like that then it can't be that rare, right? Also, having a label means this diagnosis has been studied and often that means that there is a treatment developed and a reason to hope that things can get better.

Sometimes I feel like I could identify as neurodivergent because I believe that my schizophrenia has made me markedly different from others growing up despite being medicated. I used to wish that I would get diagnosed with autism so I could accept the strangeness of myself as not a symptom of a disease like schizophrenia but the way my brain was wired.

Partly the reason why I see my schizophrenia like this is because it developed early and I had felt positive feelings about certain parts of the illness. I was happy to feel like I had superpowers, that everything meant something, and that I was communicating with the universe. But I don't want to sugarcoat schizophrenia either, since aspects of the illness were very distressing as well, such as the intense paranoia and debilitating negative symptoms. Disclaimer, I am not advocating for going off meds if they are helping, please don't stop taking your meds if they are treating your psychosis well.

I feel like my schizophrenia factored into how I see the world. It feels like a part of me that I can't change, and I know that other people around me definitely noticed I was different, (in fact, many times I had been asked if I was diagnosed with autism or ADHD) so sometimes I feel ashamed and sad that it feels like I can relate to neurodivergent people when in actuality I just have ""a psychiatric illness to be treated with medication"" versus my brain being wired differently in a way that can't be completely medicated.

username#00444,comment,1689225458.0,,"Thanks. I appreciate that.

I sure hope I’m higher functioning. It’s hard to tell sometimes. My language skills are still pretty good and I can ignore hallucinations for the most part but delusions and negative symptoms are what really get me. Of course those are hard for a doctor who only sees me every six months to evaluate.

The good thing about all of this is, I was at the doctor to check if I’m fit to drive. He thinks I am. Looks like I legally get to keep my license.

I have to keep drilling it into my head that meds are for preventing relapse. I forget that sometimes. It’s hard to remember that relapses happen, and when they happen they’re bad for me. It’s easier to convince myself that I’m cured and don’t need them anymore.",schizophrenia,my\s*(language),

username#00446,post,1649426551.0,How to get help without loosing my freedom.,"20F, I am currently not taking any medication but I am prescribed anti-psychotics and anti-depressants which I stopped taking months ago. I have been diagnosed with ASD, depression and OCD.

So I will start with when this started which was in January when I had a psychotic episode and I believed that my family had been replaced and I went to hospital voluntarily because they said that was the only way that I was allowed to leave my house is if I went with them to hospital but I was not there very long as I asked to go home even though they advised me not to because they wanted to get to the bottom of what was going on. I promised to take my medications but stopped taking them again due to thoughts that they are poison and I still have those thoughts so taking them again is not really an option. 

Ever since then I have not been able to tell what is real and what is not and sometimes I end up believing completely crazy things, right now things seem a lot more clear but it never lasts and I do not know how long I will have the awareness that something is wrong so I am trying to figure out what to do now before I spiral again. It is not just beliefs either I experience strange things like bugs under my skin, seeing impossible things happen, hearing footsteps and breathing when no one is there. 

Right now I have the awareness that something is wrong, I have written it down but I did that before when I was in hospital and after that I believed that I did not actually write that or the doctors had mind controlled me to believe that or something like that. 

The problem is that I don't know what to do. I still think the medication is poison and I do not want it and I still do not trust the doctors, I still think that they want to hurt me and even if that is not real the possibility of being sent back to another awful mental hospital is real so what do I do!? I don't want to take pills that cause brain damage but I also don't want to live in fear that people are coming to get me and are watching me and seeing and hearing strange things that scare me, it seems like no option is good...

Is there anyway that I could speak to a professional without having the danger of being imprisoned or having poison forced in me? Is that even possible!? I just want to get help but be safe at the same time.",AskDocs,diagnosed with\s*(asd),

username#00447,post,1719644542.0,What Clancy means to me as someone living with schizoaffective disorder,"(Trigger Warning: Mental health, suicide)

I know that Clancy has many connections to the Trench lore, but to be honest, I've never really kept up with the lore too much. Part of it is the fact that I love Twenty One Pilots music as is even without the addition of all the lore (my favorite album was Vessel, might be Clancy now), but if I'm honest a larger part of it is the fact that I do not like dwelling on conspiracy theories and things of that nature because I am afraid of how much my mind might cling on to patterns. However, this album made many very deep and intimate connections to my life and experiences even without the context of Dema and the rest of the lore. I thought I'd share what this album means to me not because I have some new theory about how the lyrics or symbolism tie into the lore, but because I want to share just how much impact this music has had on me, if nothing else to justify why I'll be breaking down while jamming out when I see them live for the first time in a few months. 





**Overcompensate:** This actually might be the song that spoke to me the least. Not that it's a bad song by any means, but because it is so lore-heavy and talks more about Twenty One Pilots's professional progression it is a song that I did not connect too much with. I realize much of this may be because I'm missing so much of the lore, but as I've said the lore is not something I want to get lost in due to my brain's tendency to obsess unhealthily on patterns and hidden meanings. I will say, though, that it is an excellent hype song. Every time I listen to the album, this song gets my blood pumping and gives me the energy for the journey ahead. 





**Next Semester:** This song has no right to hit me as hard as it did the first time I heard it. It is simply too energetic and fun to have me break down the way that it did. That's true for almost every single song on this album, but to be fair that's what I love about TOP, they always manage to find a way to have me jam out while I'm breaking down. Before I get into the specifics of this song I need to give some background as to why listening to this song when the full album released really had such an impact despite having been released already some time ago. 



You see, when Overcompensate first came out I was excited, but after listening to it I felt a bit conflicted. I loved the music itself, but lyric-wise I was afraid that this album was going to focus too much on the lore and not be as relatable to me as the older albums were, especially given the name of the album. Because of this, I had low expectations when Next Semester came out, so I only listened to it once when it came out—while driving. Because I was driving I didn't pay nearly enough attention to the lyrics and thought it was a great sounding song, but I didn't really put too much importance to it. Additionally, because I am in what is called the residual phase of my schizoaffective disorder, I still have minor symptoms, but no active hallucinations. Because of this I often experience anhedonia, which is the complete lack of pleasure in activities I used to love. So given that I didn't pay attention to the lyrics and given that it was nearly impossible for me to like anything at the time I sort of erased Next Semester from my memory after the first listen. So when listening to it again while reading the lyrics the day Clancy dropped, it felt like a completely new experience. 



The lyrics about remembering certain things about the day he prayed the headlights would take him home hit me in a way I wasn't prepared to be hit. My own memories of suicide attempts and other terrible days flooded me and I was transported back to how I felt during those experiences and I felt lost trying to navigate the new wave of emotions. That's when the line ""Can't change what you've done/ Start fresh next semester"" brought me to tears. I had those words said to me almost verbatim the first appointment I had with my university therapist after being hospitalized seven years ago. That pragmatic hope of—yeah, what has happened is terrible and what I've done is terrible but it's happened and there's nothing anyone can do to change it, but it doesn't have to keep being like this and there is hope that I can start anew—really spoke to me because it is a hope that took me years to be able to come to terms with. When I finally decided I had to give up, that no amount of effort was going to change my reality, that I have to accept it and make the best of it with this disorder and start fresh, that's the moment my recovery truly started. That moment of hope after being transported to such a tumultuous time in my life really made me fall in love with this song. It is probably my favorite of the whole album, but it sure wasn't the end of my emotional rollercoaster for the night. 





**Backslide:** Again, I need to give a little bit of background of what was going on in my life that gave this song such a powerful context for me. May is usually a very tough month for me, and this past May was harder than most. In Apil a coworker of mine attempted suicide. He passed in the first week of May after being in a medically induced coma due to his attempt. My mental health had been going pretty well, but this event really shook me. Besides the grief that I felt, I also had to be on the lookout for signs that my mental health was crumbling down, and there were plenty. I began to feel depressed and even began to hear voices again, voices that said I should do as my coworker did and relieve my friends and family of the burden that is my existence. I am currently on medication, so these voices were not too intense and largely manageable for the most part. I also no longer believe I am a burden, not with the same conviction at least. However these were the things I was dealing with as May 12th approached. The twelfth of May is an important day to me because it is the day I was hospitalized in 2017. Every year since it is a painful reminder of where I've been. Finally, the 24th of May is an important day to me because it is the International Schizophrenia Awareness Day. This day is often a reminder about how much schizophrenia spectrum disorders are still stigmatized and how much work still needs to be done to reduce that stigma so that others have better access to care. Coincidentally, it is also the day that Clancy dropped. Now, I don't mean to start any conspiracy theories about whether or not this coincidence means anything; it was most likely a logistical business decision. For me, however, it felt like Clancy was a gift for people like me, and it is a gift I cherish very much. 



Given this context of my deteriorating mental health, I think it's fairly straightforward why Backslide, a song about not wanting to return to darker days, hit very close to me. The lines ""Benefit from a shoe with no lace/ Take the seat with the crease in it"" to me really reminded me of being in a psych ward. Having to have shoes without laces as a safety precaution while in there is an experience that is hard to forget. On the one hand it felt degrading that I couldn't be trusted with something as commonplace as shoe laces, and yet I understood that they were right—at that moment I may have been convinced by my hallucinations to use those laces to harm myself. The seat part brought back a very specific memory of my time in the psych ward. Unfortunately there isn't much to do in a psych ward. They do try to provide activities to pass the time, but at the time I did not feel like engaging in any of them. As a result, I spent most of my time in bed or sitting on a chair. This line made me remember just how uncomfortable the chairs at the psych ward I was in were. They had no cushioning and the ones at the ward I was in didn't even have any contours to make them more comfortable. That's why this line made me laugh thinking about how if there had been a seat made of materials that could get a crease, I would have no doubt sat on that one every chance I got. Most of the song builds on this memory of being in a psych ward, ""I don't mind if it's lonely/ I don't mind if it's fair"" but one that really got to me was ""I'll take anything you have if you could throw me a line"". This made me remember my first appointment with a psychiatrist that I saw for a couple of years. I really liked that every time she prescribed a new medication, she first gave me 4-5 options, talked about the pros and cons of each medication, and ultimately let me decide which one to take. I came to really appreciate this approach because it really made me feel like I had the power to make decisions in my own treatment. However, in that first appointment I really didn't care about making a choice. I just wanted her to give me something, anything, that could assuage my suffering. I feel like in that moment I lived those lyrics. The words then transition to ""I should have loved you better"" which refocused my attention to my partner. Then the words ""Do you think that now's the time you should let go?"" hit me in one of the biggest insecurities I have in my relationship. Thankfully, I have been doing pretty well these last few years. Although my partner has certainly seen me struggle with my disorder, I am thankful that she has never had to see me at my lowest. To me this is no coincidence. I've managed to keep my head above water because she keeps me afloat. I love her and I want to spend the rest of my life with her and I never want to loose her. Yet I am constantly reminded—by the voices and by the facts of my disorder—that things can change drastically. I have no history of violence, and I know that my disorder makes me much more likely to be the victim of a violent crime than the perpetuator, and yet the stigma of violence that is often associated with schizophrenia spectrum disorders still get to me. I fear that one day, whether it be in two months or in two decades, I may loose my sense of reasoning and do something that may harm my partner or the potential family I hope to have with her. I am terrified of being that person, I am more terrified of the pressure that my partner may feel to stay with me. She has had her own challenges with mental illness and trauma, and just as I say she keeps me afloat, she also says the same about me. I am terrified that if I ever hurt her in any way, our love will make it harder for her to leave me. This has brought me to a very hard and emotional conversation with her where I asked her that if I ever lose myself and hurt her in any way, I want her to leave me and not look back. It hurts so much to say that because I love her and I can't imagine my life without her, but at the same time that love makes me want to give her the future she deserves, and if I get in the way, then I want her to be able to let go of me. I don't want to be an anchor weighing her down. I don't want to be a burden. So to me, this line is me asking her if she should let go of me, and needless to tears it gave me a knot in my stomach and brought me to tears. 





**Midwest Indigo:** I know that this song is Tyler Joseph's letter to Ohio, but when I first listened to it while listening to the full album the memory that came to my mind was being discharged from the hospital. My family didn't pick me up, instead I managed to get a friend from college to come get me. That alone made me feel isolated from my family, but even the ride back to my place with my friend felt cold. Looking back I can't really blame my friend. He tried to be nice and ask how I was doing. I said I was fine and left it at that. I didn't really feel like I could talk about how I really felt, and he wanted to respect my privacy, which I am thankful for. I don't think either of us could have done anything different, but that interaction resulted in the car ride being full of small talk and awkward silences. The whole time I was torn between wanting to reach out and talk about my time in the hospital and being too ashamed to do so. I know my friend tried to be supportive, but neither of us knew what to do in that situation, resulting in the car ride being very cold. 



Another line that I related to was ""I requested counsel with the counselor/ And he cancelled twice"". I think that anyone who has had prolonged experience with mental health care has had a mental health provider—therapist, psychiatrist, case manager, et cetera—cancel an appointment. This is completely understandable as these providers are humans too and have many potential reasons to cancel an appointment, not least of all having to attend to another patient's emergency. However whenever that happens it leaves you feeling like absolutely nobody cares, not even them. As I said, there really is no reason to take a cancellation personally, but when someone is at their most vulnerable a simple cancelation can feel much bigger than it is. 





**Routines in the Night:** This song is pretty straight forward as to how and why it relates to mental health, but two lines back to back really stood out to me. The first one is ""I'm testing the limits of what a mind can do/ I'm keeping my eyelids up no matter what"". This line specifically reminded me of the summer of 2017. That was my first summer I spent with the voices. Having lived with schizoaffective disorder, I am wary of ever saying anything that romanticizes psychosis. However, now that I am doing better and have taken an academic interest in psychosis and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, I can’t help but admit that it truly is incredible how the brain can form all these hallucinations, delusions, and other symptoms. So that first line, “I’m testing the limits of what a mind can do”, to me makes me think of how much the brain and mind push themselves to the limit when creating these terrible experiences. The next line, “I’m keeping my eyelids up no matter what”, is what really takes me back to that summer though. That summer I was still in my college town because I was suffering from asociality, which is the lack of motivation to socialize, and did not want to go back home with my family for the summer. The other people I was renting an apartment with had left for their own homes for the summer, and so I was completely alone. During this time I spent three days without food, water, or sleep. I can’t say why I did this, I don’t really remember. My mind was so jumbled up with all the hallucinations and the racing thoughts that I was incapable of taking care of myself. I knew I was sleepy, hungry, and above all, thirsty; I simply could not get myself to sleep, drink, or eat. Part of it as I said: that was my mind was too disorganized to do those things. Part of it was that the voices, my delusions, and my depression had all convinced me that I did not deserve any of those things. Ultimately, my survival instinct kicked in and I was able to drink water and go to sleep and eventually eat, but those three days have been seared into my memory as one of the lowest points of my life. 



Another one of my lowest days comes to mind when I hear the lyrics, “So beautiful, the space between/ A painful reminder and a terrible dream”. This one is quite a bit darker, so if suicidal ideation/attempts are a trigger for you, you may want to skip to Vignette. At one point, the voices I heard every waking hour had convinced me that I was a burden to all of my friends and family, that they would be so much happier without me, and that they all wanted me to die. They told me that they only way I could ever hope to make my loved ones happy was to kill myself, and I believed them. The voices told me I had to kill myself, and they even gave me instructions on how to do it. One night I grabbed a knife and attempted to slit my own throat. I pressed the blade against my neck for about 90 minutes, but ultimately could not go through with it. During that hour and a half the voices were overjoyed and encouraged me to do it. “Do it for your family,” they told me. Then they got frustrated and angry that I was taking too long. Then they became abusive and belittled me for being too much of a coward to make one simple motion with my wrist. Once I put my hand down and was it was clear that I was too afraid to go through with it, the voices had another plan, “Cut yourself until you build up the courage to slit your throat!” I began using the knife to cut myself in my arms and legs as practice. However, seeing my own blood and feeling the pain of the blade slicing through my skin amplified my survival instinct, and I stopped cutting relatively quickly, deciding instead to endure the ridicule and the hatred of the voices and the guilt of believing that I was too weak to make my loved ones happy. I may not have cut myself too much or too deeply, but a few slight scars did form, a few of which I can still make out on my skin if I look hard enough. Those scars to me are a painful reminder of the terrible dream that I tried to make come true that night. I have made so much progress since then, but I still have those scars. I hesitate to call anything that happened “beautiful,” but I do believe that my path to recovery and commitment to life is beautiful, and that is what lies between my scars today and that terrible dream.





**Vignette:** I think that this song is pretty clearly about substance abuse, but I was still able to find some some lines that still felt very relatable despite the fact that I have not experienced any challenges with substance use. The first line to connect with me was, “Testing what is real, what is good. Man, it’s been a long night”. This line reminded me of times I have had to do something called “Reality Testing” which is when I try different techniques to see if what I am hearing is real or not. If my partner or anyone I trust is near me it is fairly straightforward, I just have to ask if they heard it. However, sometimes I am not next to people I trust and I have to find other ways of testing reality. I check my surroundings to see if anyone else is reacting to the noise, and I also have an accessibility feature turned on in my iPhone that notifies me of any loud noises and levels what it thinks it might be, e.g. a child screaming. 



The lines that really got to me were “He’s thinking, ‘There’s no way I’m headed there’/ Always sure-footed, educated, and was never scared/ Now he can’t hold out his hand without it shaking”. I really relate to these lines because it almost feels like the story of my life before I began developing my disorder. I graduated high school as valedictorian and got accepted into the honors program of one of the top five public universities in the United States. My first year in college I finished with a 4.0 GPA and was projected to graduate in three years. Of course, that all fell apart my second year in college, but sometimes I think back at who I used to be and mourn the potential of who I could have been and wish there were something I could do to stop what happened or at least prepare for it. The line about having shaky hands also drives that point home. One common side-effect of antipsychotic medications—the medications I take to calm the voices—is shaking and twitching. Sometimes these medications can cause tardive dyskinesia, which is uncontrollable movement of muscles, particularly in the face, and is often permanent. The most common side effect is sedation, often making me feel like a zombie. Because of this, the sentiment of having a seemingly bright future devolve into shaking hands felt very personal. 



**The Craving (Jenna’s version):** Oh boy! Here come the tears! I’ll try to keep this short since I have already typed quite a bit. This song dug up an insecurity of mine that I brought up in Backslide. I love my girlfriend more than have ever loved anyone—more than I ever thought possible. She is my rock and my light. She is my world. However, because of my condition, I am terrified that one day I will hurt her emotionally or worse. Because of this I often find myself subconsciously holding things from her. I feel guilty that by making her fall in love with me I am making it harder for her to leave me if she ever has to. I know it doesn’t make sense, I know its self-sabotage, but sometimes I can’t help but want to keep some distance between us so that she can leave me. Nothing scares me more than having our love chain her down to me as I am sinking. I am terrified at the idea that one day she needs to leave me but can’t because she loves me too much, and I end up hurting her more. I do this because I love her and I want to protect her, but this song reminds me that this way of thinking isn’t fair. It isn’t fair to her that I keep my distance because I am afraid of something that will likely never happen. It’s not fair that I don’t give myself entirely to her when I know that is all she wants and that she has given herself entirely to me. It’s not fair that I make this into a self-fulfilling prophecy. It’s not fair that after nearly five wonderful years of being together, she is still my girlfriend and not my wife. It’s not fair that I am too afraid by what might happen that I can’t get myself to propose despite knowing with all of my being that she is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. I used to say I want to die before I am old, but because of her I might think twice. My desire to protect her from me is getting in my own way, and I hope I can communicate to her how much I love her and how much I crave to be with her the rest of my life. This song reminds me that I need to let go of my fear and just love her, here and now. In perpetuum et unum diem.





**Lavish:** This song is a much needed emotional break after sobbing so much during the last song. By itself, this song is probably my least favorite of the album (but by no means a bad song), but when taken in as part of the album as a whole I think that this song really serves a purpose of resetting the emotions back towards baseline. The song gives me the vibe of looking your best at your worst, like wearing a three-piece suit while at the psych ward. The line that really drives that feeling home to me is, “Got that penny loafer squeak, across linoleum”, given that every hospital I have been in has had linoleum floors. Easier to clean up spills I imagine. The line that really got my attention though was the proctologist line. It was so out of pocket and so out of character for Twenty One Pilots and this album specifically that I couldn’t help but laugh out loud the first time I heard it. I’m thankful for that, there’s something very therapeutic about laughing after crying.





**Navigating:** This song is a banger, first and foremost. That being said I think it is pretty straight forward as far as how it is relatable not just to me but to so many other people as well. It touches on themes of trying to explore and understand the things that are going on in my mind, as well as how the connection with loved ones can make me feel at home and at peace despite all the turmoil in my life. It’s a great song, and for me it is perfect that it doesn’t hit too close to home because it sort of eases me back into introspection after the break provided by Lavish.





**Snap Back:** Aaaand we’re back! This track brings back a lot of the themes that I already went over, particularly in Backslide. However, the line “Is it even good for my head to keep track?” Really felt personal to me the first time that I heard it. As I already mentioned, the day that Clancy released coincided with Schizophrenia Awareness Day, and earlier that day I was reflecting on my journey since first being diagnosed. As a part of that trip down memory lane, I actually looked up how long it had been since the last time I had been hospitalized and I saw that it had been almost 2,600 days. That brought me a sense of pride that I have been able to stave off going to a hospital for so long, yet it was a bit of a mixed emotion because it brought back memories of that time in my life, and fears that I am headed there again. It really made me wonder if it is even healthy for me to be so obsessed with that day, is it even right for my head to keep track of long it has been since that terrible day? Hearing that line just a few hours after having that exact same conversation with myself really made me feel like I was being called out, like this song was specifically meant for me that day in a way. That line was also shortly followed by “Running from a thing that I kicked in ’17” which also connected with me. That hospitalization was in 2017, and although I wouldn’t exactly say I kicked my symptoms to the curb back in 2017 (I still have some symptoms from time to time), the fact that the song singles out the year I was last hospitalized still made this song feel very personal to me. 



The stanza that starts with “Oh, it’s you, well, welcome back to the show” also made me think of different points in my life. Throughout my journey I have had times where my medication works better and I have fewer symptoms and feel better overall. These periods are often followed by periods of remission where I slide back to more difficult times. I guess it’s just the ebb and flow of life; not just my life, but everybody’s life really. The times where I can feel myself sliding back to psychosis are often accompanied by visits to therapists that I haven’t seen in a while. This stanza very much feels like a conversation I have had with different therapists when I see them after a while of doing alright. The line that really gets me is “It’s a new adaptation/ It’s a backslide”. I have heard therapist use that language of how new behaviors are just new adaptations to the problems brewing in my mind, and as much as I understand that to be true when I am doing well, when I am at my depths it feels like fancy, overly-positive language used to cover up the fact that in reality it is just, well, a backslide. 





**Oldies Station:** This one may be one of the most meaningful songs to me in this album, if not the most meaningful one. The line, “And as you move about, you learn to tune them out/ But they say they continue to grow” takes me back to a very specific day a few years back when I was walking through campus on my way to class when I realized that I was still hearing whispers, but they weren’t as loud or as intense and I was doing a good job of ignoring them. I don’t know exactly when I started to tune them out, I just realized that although I could still hear them, I wasn’t actually listening to the voices. Of course, the voices felt threatened by this and they would tell me I was getting worse and that they were getting ready to hit me with more intensity than they had ever before, but for the first time I wasn’t scared. I didn’t believe them, and honestly, I didn’t care what they said. The lines, “Make an oath, then make mistakes/ Start a streak you’re bound to break/ When darkness rolls on you/ Push on through” really do a good job of instilling hope in me—not a naive, overly-optimistic hope, but a realistic hope that brings me feelings of warmth. It’s an understanding that things will go wrong, that there will be some steps backwards, but that isn’t the whole story. Two steps forward, one step back may sound like a chore, but it is progress. I may one day very well break my streak of days outside a psych ward, but not today. For now I will keep pushing forward. 



Another line that has special meaning to me is “Found your capacity for love and tragedy/ Embracing how things always change”. I was raised in a household where mental illness was seen as a weakness and a personal failing. I was brought up in a hispanic household, and being a hispanic male I have had plenty of expectations of machismo placed on me. I was raised to believe that mental illnesses are not real, that they are excuses weak people make for not getting their life together. So in a way, I see it as a form of poetic justice that someone with such cold-hearted believes as me was suddenly struck with my own mental health challenges. Having lived through these experiences myself really tore apart my understanding of myself, the mind, and other people. What I built in its stead was a belief system founded on love and compassion. One of the ironies in my life is that I truly do believe that in a way, going through everything I have been through has made me a better person. I don’t like the person I used to be, and although I wish I had never had to go through the tragedy that is schizophrenia, I am grateful for the person it has helped make me.



The other line that really speaks to me is “In a season of lessons learned in giving up/ You learn what you can and can’t take”. As I have mentioned before, I used to be a very successful student before my illness struck. That is why when I first faced the challenges that this disorder brought I found it really difficult to accept my new reality. I desperately wanted my life to go back to the way that it was. I desperately felt the need to meet the expectations I had learned to put on myself. At times I didn’t want to take my meds or go to a therapist because my upbringing told me that it was all a waste of time and I was ashamed that I was even a position where others considered it the best thing for me. I desperately tried to fight to regain my ability to concentrate, read, write, and comprehend all by myself and fought against the proposal of getting accommodations. Ultimately I failed my classes and was dismissed from the university. It was the first time I can remember ever getting a grade other than an A, and it destroyed my self-image. Thankfully I had a great psychiatrist that I saw through the university, and she was able to get those classes retroactively withdrawn from my record and got me back into classes under one condition, I had to go to the Student Disability Center for accommodations. The SDC got me private rooms in which to take tests with added time, additional unexcused absences with paid note-takers in all of my classes so that I didn’t have to stress about going to class on days when the hallucinations were too much, and a smart pen that recored audio while I took notes, so that I could listen to lectures again if my hallucinations interrupted my classes. It wasn’t until I gave up on reliving my past life that I was able to begin the fight for my new life. It wasn’t until I accepted that I couldn’t perform the same way I used to that I began to be successful again. It was a hard pill to swallow, and it took me over two years to come to terms with my new reality, but now that I did I graduated with a bachelors degree from that same prestigious university, have a great job that I am proud to show up to, and best of all I have someone very special in my life that loves me. We often see being relentless and never giving up as a virtue, but I’ve learned that you have to pick your battles, and that giving up may be how you finally start to fight.





**At the Risk of Feeling Dumb:** This song is pretty unique in that it managed to put me on both sides of being in a support system. On the one hand I related to the sentiment of wanting to be left alone in my lowest points, despite the fact that that’s when we need support the most. On the other, it reminded me how important it is to not just reach out for support when we need it, but also how important it is to give that support to others when they might need it. I have had that conversation about having easy access to weapons (knives in my case) with my roommate whom I asked to hide them from me. I know how difficult it is to bring those topics up. But I have also learned what it means to be there for someone in their time of need through my job in which I provide peer-support for others going through a mental health crisis. However, this song made me realize that I do not check in with my friends as much as I would like. Something about knowing them makes it harder to approach them about these things than it is to approach a stranger. Maybe its because they have given me so much support that it is hard to reverse the roles, maybe its because I fear making our relationships awkward, maybe I’m afraid that only I go through these things and am afraid of feeling dumb when reaching out to others. Am I the only one I know waging my wars behind my face and above my throat? I realize how difficult it is to reach out, and it only makes me appreciate those that reach out to me more. That makes me realize that I want to be that person who checks in on their friends every once in a while, even if I feel dumb and awkward doing so.         





**Paladin Strait:** I know that this song is mostly for the lore, but it still managed to be the perfect end to my journey with this album. I realize that the fictional Paladin Strait may represent many different aspects of the Trench/Clancy lore, but for me it represents all the struggles I have had to overcome with this illness. The water ripping with rage, the hurtling storm with its endless row of angry waves, it all is a perfect metaphor for the anger and hatred that the voices have had against me. The abusive self-hatred that they brought into my life, the self-hatred that could surely have drowned me many times over. Yet, in the midst of such a terrible storm I have managed to stay afloat. Not because people in my life have kept me afloat, but because people in my life have given me the hope and self-belief that I can still push on through and cross the strait. Above all is my partner whom I love. As I said before, she is my light, she is my world. I hesitate to say that I would gladly go through everything I have gone through ever again, but I realize that if my life hadn’t developed the way it did, we most likely would have never been together. I am forever grateful that I found my partner in my path, and in that sense I would gladly swim across my own Paladin Straight time and time again just so I can be with her. I have learned that it is an important distinction to make between her saving me and her giving me the tools to help me save myself. That’s why I love that the song doesn’t say that the person on the other shoreline saves Tyler/Clancy(?), but rather that them being in their life gives them the strength to swim the Paladin Strait. To me, putting all of my struggles and all of my challenges into one seemingly insurmountable obstacle and reminding me of the hope and the light that she gives me to be able to overcome all the obstacles is a perfect summarization of all the experiences that this album made me relive, and all the new experiences it brought me. The long pause towards the end also feels like the peace and serenity that I have been able to experience when I take into account not just the struggles I have had to overcome, but the blessings in my life that have helped me get where I am now. It feels like the end of a good life-changing therapy session. I also like the very end, because although I am sure it represents many different things in the lore, the way Nico(?) isn’t completely defeated and is still present in the end is also a good representation of the fact that I am not “cured” from my schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. I may be better able to manage it now than I was before and I may be able to keep it in check for the most part, but it isn’t gone. That is not to say that it is a hopeless battle, but rather a call to accept that this is my reality and that this will likely be a part of me for the rest of my life. However, armed with the hope and the love that those close to me bring me, I am not necessarily scared of my voices. The tide may be coming back in at this point in my life, but just like every angry wave that came before it, I know the tide will eventually subside and go back into the straight. Hope. That is what Clancy means to me.



Feel free to tell me what this album means for you, and if you see somebody ugly crying while singing their hearts out at one of their upcoming concerts, be kind to them. It might be me.

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia for 10 years until early this year my psychiatrist told me he's 100% sure its bipolar 1. Honestly, I have a hard time believing it.

My delusions are bizarre, paranormal, paranoid, and extremely horrifying to deal with. When I get stressed, my psychosis gets triggered for months. 

I am recovering from my latest psychotic episode, and I now find myself elated, irritable, and coming up with huge business ideas all the time. I have repeating thoughts that just won't stop. I have had insomnia for 2 months but this was related to my paranoia, otherwise I sleep for 12 hours until 1pm.

username#00451,post,1561720277.0,I may have started properly hallucinating..? Fruit fly won't leave me alone,"I posted a week and a half ago regarding my cognitive decline and negative symptoms worsening. In summary: I had a big psychotic episode in 2013 for 9 months and when it ended, I haven't had a big episode since. A few days after my last post, I ended up getting hospitalised while at my university hospital placement. I had a migraine with aura for the first time, and ever since then, things have gotten weirder. I started to see and react to a single fruit fly. This fruit fly keeps following me everywhere and is at the hospital, inside buildings, in the tram, and at my house. I react to it because it flies in front of my face and then disappears after 5 seconds. It is very vivid but sometimes looks strange (looks diagonal?). I just saw it again 10 minutes ago. I'm not sure if it's real or not because it's winter and my husband says he hasn't seen a fly in months. People at my placement look at me weird when I react to the fly and try to swat it away.

I don't know if it's real or not because flies do exist.. does anyone ever hallucinate things like this? I'm convinced it's real but my husband thinks I'm hallucinating it. I've only ever dealt with intense bizarre delusions, never hallucinations this vivid and random. Stress triggers my delusions, and I have been extremely stressed lately (hence why the migraine) This fly pops up at random times of the day.

I have a final placement coming up soon working in a mental health clinic for 4-5 months doing counselling and therapy, as I am striving to become a mental health social worker and to get my AMHSW accreditation in 2 years).

I have bipolar 1 and unfortunately got psychotic during my first placement and had to cease my placement but I wasn't medicated at the time.

Now that I'm medicated, I'm somewhat fine!

In regards to your analogy of going to a 600lb person for fitness advice - I think this is better:

A fitness advisor who used to be 600lb but is now fit/ on their journey to be fit is a good option for fitness advice because they have lived experience.

A mental health professional who has gone through/is going through some mental health struggles of their own but is now medicated and relatively stable is a good option because they have lived experience and can relate to their clients' struggles.

This doesn't mean that you're not going to relapse sometimes, but honestly most social work departments are extremely supportive of their workers and accommodate to their mental health needs. Some workers without prior mental health issues get PTSD and depression while on the job; therefore they have to be understanding of all mental health issues.

Most people with psychosis are bigger threats to themselves than others, but the trauma around dealing with an angry moody unmedicated person is A LOT to deal with. 

Confronting a person's delusions is a weird one, because she could potentially turn on your SIL and FIL if they confronted her and start thinking they're one of ""THEM"". Then she wont trust anybody and will probably never get help until she gets arrested and involuntarily hospitalised. I'm not defending their enabling behaviour though, at all.

I don’t have much contact with my parents (they’re embarrassed by the fact that their child’s life has stagnated since highschool) so he’s really the only person I have communication with on such a basis. He’s such a trooper, and the ways he’s helped me are definitely not something “most” people would be able to handle in a relationship. I was really worried since my disability does make the relationship that much more difficult, especially since I just don’t have the energy to do all the things regular people do since technically I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder depressive type, so I spend a lot of my time in bed. But he’s a homebody who prefers to spend the majority of his free time playing video games. And when I’m in the mood/have enough dopamine to be able to concentrate and play, we play Runescape together. Bless his heart. 
I know in clinical settings, there’s a huge focus around family helping out us schizophrenics, and for me, he’s definitely stepped up to the plate and taken on that role in many aspects. And for those reasons, I trust in him when I’m being controlled by my hallucinations and delusions.
I believe most schizophrenics would be SO much better off with the support of loved ones.

I'm 17, which may complicate the diagnostic and treatment process, here in Australia anyway. I'm on a steady stream of antipsychotics (albeit ones that don't work) and have been for a few months, and for the foreseeable future, after I was given a psychiatric evaluation about a month ago. However, despite being on antipsychotics, and going through the diagnostic process for schizophrenia, I received no diagnosis. Not just no psychotic disorder diagnosis, no diagnosis period. Nothing was changed in my medical records. I was diagnosed with ASD a month prior but my ASD is not the irritable kind, which would otherwise explain my medication. I'm afraid of having to bear such a heavy label, but I'm also confused as to what exactly is going on. I know during my evaluation my parents tried to downplay everything I said to anxiety, and that probably had some influence over my psychiatrists decision, but not even any kind of anxiety diagnosis was added to my record. I have a treatment plan for something which I don't even know the full extent of. All i have to go off is my psychotherapist frequently bringing up paranoid schizophrenia and schizophrenia in passing conversation, and discussing positive and negative symptoms with me. And my hospital discharge from August where I was discharged with delirium of all things. I'm just confused as to my pretty much soft diagnosis from my therapist, without any real answer. Being placed on antipsychotics long term would indicate a psychotic disorder, but neither my psychologist nor my psychiatrist will confirm nor deny that this is what it is, in fact they won't confirm or deny that anything is the cause. Is this normal? I'm not asking to be diagnosed, I have a feeling i'll figure it out once i turn 18, i'm just a bit confused, is this normal? I would call my psychiatrist directly but apparently here in Australia that is not possible. Any thoughts on this?

I'm not sure whether to call what I'm experiencing, but I feel like I'm going to do something stupid. I suddenly felt extremely happy and hyper on Thursday it's now Sunday here in Australia, since then I've slept less and less to the point where I've slept about 5 hours in the last 48, briefly falling asleep only to arise 1-3 hours later and staring at the ceiling extremely restless and agitated. My friends have noted that when I speak I talk extremely quickly and sometimes my words mix together to the point where my friend said I was speaking gibberish. Even I reflected on it and realised after not making contact with a single one of them for weeks possibly months I suddenly talked to a few of them for an hour straight until my throat hurt and I nearly lost my voice. And I did literally the exact same thing the day after. I'm worried about doing something stupid because all of a sudden people don't seem to be who they say they are, I'm also aware that I am now EXTREMELY fucking hostile and very impulsive and violent. It doesn't seem bad enough for a hospital visit, I haven't acted on anything but I have really violent and racing thoughts as well as extreme rage at literally nothing. I have barely eaten anything and I don't get hungry or thirsty and I'm not even sleepy. I feel like I can do anything and I want to do all of my work right now but I can't focus and I keep getting distracted and jumpy at things that nobody else seems to notice. I don't think it's bad enough for a hospital visit, nobody else has noticed, at least not yet. Does anybody know what to do? I have psychotic tendencies and something like this has happened before but it hasn’t been this intense.

username#00453,post,1626133404.0,Coming to terms,"I've been struggling with what I believe are psychotic experiences for just over a year (gangstalkers, shadow people, incomprehensible whispers) as well as negative symptoms like anhedonia, loss of motivation and in rare cases even some kind of catatonia. I've been assessed for autism and treated for it, with no success, assessed for anxiety, treated for it, again no success, I only recently became aware that what I was experiencing wasn't normal and certainly wasn't just a panic disorder like I originally thought it was. I'm getting a psychiatric evaluation in just under a month and I'm both relieved and scared, scared that they'll ignore me like they have before, or that I'll get told I have a psychotic disorder because even when I haven't been professionally diagnosed thinking of my experiences as psychotic makes me dismal. I don't even know if it may be schizophrenia or not, I've spent some time on this sub, shared my experiences, as well as other mental health forums. I realise that until I get assessed nothing is for certain, but it's slowly going from ""What could I have?"" to ""What ELSE could I have?"" I don't think the realisation that what I experience is indicitive of psychosis has even set in and I don't know what I'll do when it does. For now my doctors are working on a process of elimination, they eliminated autism as they already know that I have it, they've tried therapy and other methods to see if I was manifesting the symptoms myself, it didn't work but at least I know I'm autistic. They then thought it was anxiety, and that I was anxious about normal experiences that may lead to schizophrenia, since I originally went to a doctor and said that I was worried I may be developing some kind of psychotic disorder; That didn't work either, I have had a history of panic attacks and anxiety, but once psychosis really seemed to set in that went away. I'm not sure if I'm really psychotic and I don't really want to be, but the more I seem the think about it when I'm lucid, the less and less sense anxiety/autism makes and the more and more sense schizophrenia makes.

username#00453,post,1623195033.0,Difficulties in diagnosis?,"TW // Drugs, Self Harm

If it makes a difference I am a 17 year old male living in Australia.

I have been seeing my psychologist for a while, I originally went to him after my friends informed me that what i was experiencing was not normal and indicative of schizophrenia, I didn't really want to go, but I went anyway. I started trying to log my experiences and look back over them or show them to other people. I've showed other people said journals, including other mental health forums when asking general questions and they ask whether I have ever been diagnosed, the answer is, I don't know. I was hospitalised for hearing voices, but discharged after the registrar declared it underlying anxiety. Since that point I had what I believe to be a major psychotic break that lasted almost two months (Start of march to mid-late april) in which I saw shadow people, heard the voice of god telling me that if I didn't cut myself other people would get hurt, I heard whispers telling me things and the very deep voice of a man who insulted me at every chance he got. I still have all these things, I saw one of them earlier and I've locked myself in my room since. I told my psychologist about these experiences under the guidance of my former partner and friends. He tried to tell me that ""my autism spectrum diagnosis was making me fake symptoms of schizophrenia to avoid punishment for my poor school performance"" but something about that doesn't sit right with me. I admitted myself to hospital after having what they said was acute psychosis a few months and was reviewed by a team, but a psychiatrist apparently told my mother that it was just aspergers, and that I was fine. However upon seeing my regular therapist, it was strange. After months of seemingly downplaying my symptoms, he all of a sudden expressed great concern for me. 

""Anon, these delusions and hallucinations have been going on for quite some time, I'm very concerned about you""

Me: ""Oh, thats what they are?""

""Yes, thats what they are""

Me: ""What now?""

""I can't do anything, I'm just a child psychologist, I can help little timmy who is afraid of the dark but schizophrenia and psychosis is for psychiatrists to deal with. I have previously worked on psychotic patients but I don't anymore, this is out of my hands, paranoid schizophrenia isn't something that I can deal with, the treatment plan is at the pointy end of the stick""

Me: ""Oh, okay""

It sounds as if they are beginning to take my experiences as legitimate, but I'm still confused as to whats going on, Im aware I may be schizophrenic, but I am no doctor. Has anybody else been told that they have underlying anxiety or autism, prior to diagnosis with schizophrenia? It sounds like he is saying I have schizophrenia, but he only ever implies it indirectly, is there some kind of legal binding that prevents doctors from informing a patient of their condition? At this point in time I'm just confused.",schizophrenia,my\s*(autism),

username#00454,comment,1660283046.0,,"Never been hospitalized for it. Should've been a couple times but they refused. Meds have been 95% unsuccessful. I tried I think 6 meds before landing on Vraylar which helped for a while. I definitely still had symptoms, and episodes, but it was manageable. Oddly enough it did entirely stop my manic episodes so... The problem is, it only worked for about a year and a half and then just stopped. I tried going up on it but that caused a dystonic reaction. They tried putting me on Cogentin to counter that side effect, but I reacted to it with a rash. So we moved on to Thorazine. Thorazine worked wonderfully up until I came off of it recently. It probably still would if I'd take it. I had almost no symptoms of schizophrenia any more on it, just the tv in another room or sirens in the distance sometimes. Even that was a lot less often. I came off it on my own due to having no psychiatrist at the time (I have an appointment on the 16th with a new one), because the nightmares it caused became unbearable. I knew for a while the nightmares were bad, but didn't realize until recently it was the Thorazine causing them. I probably shouldn't share details here bc nsfw, but I was afraid to fall asleep at all. Which sucked even more because of how much the Thorazine made me sleep.

Basically, overall therapy is quite helpful, but medicine is not. I've had side effects on every antipsychotic I've been on, and most didn't even help me. Still hopeful enough to try something else though, because the reason I even started meds was being suicidally paranoid, and that's something I'd rather never experience again, or let anyone else experience ever, thanks.",schizophrenia,my\s*(manic),
username#00454,comment,1660280049.0,,"I find not many coping mechanisms work, and the ones that do, don't always, but distraction from the psychotic symptoms generally helps. Sometimes games can distract me, or music, or drawing, but sometimes none do. Then I just call mom over and ask her to keep talking, as I find listening to a real person's voice soothing. Or I'll hug my cats. I find that feeling a living thing breathe is consistently helpful unless I'm paranoid about them specifically. If mom isn't available I try to get on a discord call with someone that knows what's going on, or if that fails too I like to watch Jacksepticeye's old videos. There have been moments, though, where instead of distraction, releasing the thoughts and feelings was better. Talking to someone about it or writing it all down may help. Any combination of these things could help or make things worse at different times, but especially sound or touch stimulus may scare me more, though I think that's due to being autistic too.

As for symptoms, hoo boy they've been all over the place. I don't remember most of my actual episodes, but 3 stand out. 1 I was seeing demons and thought they were going to kill me. Another I was so terrified of everything that I wanted to kill myself to escape. That's the one that made me start medicine. Both of those I had some degree of awareness of what was actually going on, and was able to talk to mom about it and figure out what would help in that moment. The suicidal one I wound up just sleeping it off after getting mom to make the old man put his guns in the safe. The last I kinda just curled up rocking and crying on the couch. I thought the cats were some sort of giant mechanical beasts that physically couldn't fit into a cat's body, and that mom was a scientist or doctor or something and was controlling them. I thought if I said any of that to her she'd have them attack me. I think that's the only time since knowing I'm schizophrenic that I just lost all touch with reality. 

For paranoia about being watched: this sounds weird, but it's actually helpful for me to know that it's absolutely possible I am being watched in this era, and consider 'who would bother with me specifically though, out of everyone out there'. I do understand that'd probably make most people worse though...sorry if it bothers you. I almost always am experiencing some sort of hallucination, but it's usually nothing more than annoying. Figuring out if it's real or not is about all I can really do for it. The most common auditory ones are hearing a tv being played in another room or ambulance sirens in the distance. The tv one is honestly irritating. Even growing up I pretty much always had it and would sleep with a fan on, on high, because of it. I also hear dishes clanking, the toilet lid being closed, or my name being called. Visual ones used to mainly be shadow animals, that got bigger with time until it was mainly panthers. Now I see patterns and shapes of light, or sequences of letters and numbers, in the walls and ceilings.

On a last note, I have one major trigger for psychosis, and it's whispering. When people whisper I get very mad very fast, start hallucinating, and want to harm both myself and others. Unfortunately, most people are assholes that will do something more if you ask them nicely to stop, and find it funny when you freak the fuck out.",schizophrenia,being\s*(autistic),

There were activities though. I remember there being a swimming pool. I swam laps once. I also threw up a few times because I started feeling like food tasted like burning plastic and I made myself food that didn't taste very good. I was supervised. I made something with cream cheese that was sweet. It turns out you shouldn't spread it so thick. I felt sick after that. Also I managed to injure myself. I fell down stairs. That was embarrassing because I started crying. I cried for hours. It didnt even hurt very bad. After those incidents I was supervised more closely. The worst thing that happened though is when I felt anxious, homesick, shaky and disoriented. That was my 2nd night. I started pacing and thinking about how I wish I could get the taste of burnt plastic out of my mouth. I started puking a lot. I woke people up. I went back to bed and all of a sudden I was standing outside of the shower crying. I really didnt want to shower. Well, I had unknowingly peed myself and I really didnt want a shower.

I dont fully understand this situation either. I remember going to therapy a while ago. I thought it was therapy. My mom was there though. I had to talk to a lot of people.

My mom was tense during this. I tried to lighten up the situation. I felt so uncomfortable because she was acting stressed out. I started feeling like I create stress. I just started apologizing. I didn't know what to do. Well, It turns out that was some kind of psychiatric evaluation. I've had a few of those. That one was just more recent. I had a few when I was a child.

Today I drank some wine to help feel better. I got money and bought rum and wine. Yesterday night was rough. I couldn't sleep. Sleeping is hard these days. I get agitated. 

My parents dont know what to do with me. They said that. They said they want me to get my shit together. I find that hard to do. I can tell how frustrated they are.

People tell me that I must be very high functioning a lot. They don't understand that some days I just cant function at all. I will probably not be able to live alone. Yet some people think I can. They don't think I need all of the support that I get. Someone even told me that I dont have autism or schizophrenia because I can hold a conversation. Most of my conversations are scripted and repeats and mashups of old conversations to be honest. I mask a lot I guess. 

However it's also weird when someone acknowledges my struggles because I feel embarrassed and like there is something wrong with me. I read my IEP in Grade 12. I read my mental health assessments. Those make me feel like I'm not like most people my age. It makes me cry sometimes. Sometimes I wish I was neurotypical because then I wouldn't struggle as much with things that NTs find easy.

Then people laugh at me for being different or people are uncomfortable around me. I made some teen girls uncomfortable because I started crying at the library.

I just get super frustrated. Also my siblings get annoyed with me a lot. They think I ruin moments. They dont include me a lot of the time.

I know a lot of people my age who live on their own. I wouldn't even know where to begin. Both my siblings are more independent than I am. They do a lot of things alone. This is embarrassing but I still cant sleep alone in a dark room sometimes. Sometimes I need to sleep on the floor in someone else's room. I also have a hard time figuring out the bus schedule. I'm terrible with directions. I have a hard time shopping and avoid it whenever my relatives are going shopping. 

My family tells me I need to be more mature sometimes. They say I should handle my emotions better. They want me to do more things on my own. I'm scared of the idea of that. But I want to be independent. 

Sometimes I wonder if my family is trying to get rid of me. They always get mail from respite services. I looked it up. They also go to support groups but try to hide it from me.

I feel like I have a lot of weaknesses that need to be fixed. I had an IEP in school and it listed my weaknesses and what I need to work on. I needed to work on a lot. I read both of my psychiatric assessments and it made me feel upset. My parents go to support groups because of me. I found a worksheet my mom had to fill out at one. It was about stuff she wanted for me in the future. She wrote that she wanted me to be happy. That's all I remember. I mostly feel weird because hygiene is hard for me. I'm 21. It seems like most people my age can take care of their basic hygiene needs. I'm still working on that. Brushing my teeth is hard and so is showering. I'm working on a morning routine with my support worker. I'm seeing her again today. I live in a small city where I run into people I know a lot. I think they know I am with a support worker. It makes me feel weird. 

Also in school I always had an aide with me. They would sit next to me in class and help me with my work. Someone in my class once said that special ed students are spoiled and behave badly and that they shouldn't recieve so much help. It made me feel weird. Also I dislike when my teacher would vent about how teachers dont like teaching lower level classes because the students are badly behaved. Another time a teacher accused me of skipping school because I wasn't at the same math level as other students in the class. Also once during a field trip I went on, a special ed teacher went to support me. People  asked each other about it, wondering why she needed to go because it was a university level class and apparently she didn't need to be there.

I have emotional regulation issues. So if I feel a way I have a hard time calming down. People think I throw tantrums. Honestly I dont because for me it's a loss of control. I've gotten better though. I have better coping methods. I tend to rock back and forth or pronounce words backwards. It really helps. I had a ""tantrum"" in front of my cousins friend because I lost a good luck charm. I honestly could not control myself. They looked shocked. But my relatives acted calm. I feel bad that they are so used to it that they know what to do. I haven't had an outburst for a while now though. 

I feel like I go forwards or backwards depending on the day. My parents get frustrated with me sometimes. They will think everything is going well and then suddenly it isn't. They want me to be ""normal"" sometimes. Also I have read stuff on caregiver forums about how people feel like their child having Autism or Schizophrenia is an awful thing. They vent and say things that makes me feel sad when I read it. Like how their kid is annoying or that its embarrassing to deal with. I get it, it must be hard. I'm worried that my parents think I'm annoying. 

I was a troubled teen. I started trying to encourage my friends to skip class. I felt miserable in grade 8. I talked to much older men online. I got blackout drunk for the first time. I felt this darkness in the world. My friends thought I was weird and one of them even disliked me. Their parents didnt like me either. Then in grade 9 I started popping pills. I thought i discovered a secret escape. Nobody knew. I thought everything was getting better. Then grade 11 happened. Then grade 12. Those were the worst 2 years of my life 2nd to grade 8. 

I had my first spiritual experience in grade 12. It was great but very weird. I didnt see a psychiatrist until after grade 12. I have since had 2 spiritual experiences. I guess my relatives are right, I cant live alone. I think it's because I'd fall back into old habits and I'd probably make bad decisions. I'm worried of ending up homeless to be honest. My parents might get tired of me. I dont really want to live in a group home or care home. But those seem to be my options. It even said that in my transition plan. I feel like living in a group home has a lot of stigma attached to it. Also I might not want to tell people I know from school that I live in a group home because some of them are judgy. My old friend would definitely judge me. Sorry for the long reply. I just am feeling so many emotions right now and just drank a big glass of iced coffee.

My grandfather who was diagnosed with Dementia for a year now passed away three days ago. Two days before his death we all had to say our goodbyes due to him waking up with blood in his mouth, and the nurse giving him 2 weeks if he was lucky. 

Everyone took turns saying their goodbyes; holding his hands, kissing his forehead, etc. 
He never knew who I was for the week that we stayed there. As I got to his bedside and reached for his hand, and looked at him he withdrew his hand, and said something mean (I couldn't exactly hear what he said since he was deaf, but his tone was all I needed to hear.), he then leaned a little bit away from me. Once I realized that he didn't know who I was, and he didn't want me near him I broke down in tears and ran out of their assisted living home.

You could pick another natlang you'd like to emulate, or there are simpler ways like getting a word generator for something more unique and randomized, though I don't know much about those or how to customize them. 

First I use regular (stupid) google translate to find the closest match I can. I find maybe 2-5 letters I like for a root depending on word type, but it can come from any sensible part of the word (ignoring their own terminations of course, trying to avoid most prefixes when noticed).

I used to have an almost photographic memory, I would read several books in a week, and I was very intelligent, particularly when it came to maths and English. This was all when I was 7 - 13, now at 19 schizophrenia has seriously damaged all of these. 

I was talking with my mum today and asked her about how old one of our pets are, and she told me they died a couple months back. I live at home, in the same house as this pet, and until now I still thought they were alive. Apparently my mum did tell me when they died and I was very aware of it, but I have no memory of any of this. I can't read anymore, my ability to take in any of what I'm reading just isn't there, I'm useless when it comes to maths, and even the simplest things I can't seem to do mentally. My memory in general is completely fucked, I struggle to remember what happened half an hour ago, I forget major life events, faces, names and personalities of those I'm close to, I forget my own name, important dates, what day, month or year it is, I almost feel like i have dementia or something, it's like the last 6 years never happened, and nothing is ever retained, it's seriously damaging my life. Other than that, I'm very confused constantly, I often stumble over my words or just make no sense, I also struggle to stay on topic and people find it difficult to hold a conversation with me as a result.

I know I have generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder (both diagnosed by a psychiatrist), but I was referred to a psych ward a month ago with a diagnosis of bipolar 2 with psychotic symptoms by the same psychiatrist, then when I was there they diagnosed me with psychosis and said they don't think I'm bipolar, but they also mentioned something about a subtype of schizophrenia. I'm a 16 year old male if that helps at all. Basically, I've had anxiety issues ever since I was 5, I also had a lot of experience with having auditory hallucinations at the same very young age, they went away eventually but my anxiety stayed and began getting worse. I was bullied physically and verbally on a regular basis from the age of 5 to 12, when the regular bullying stopped but my closest friend began verbally putting me down in front of everyone we knew, which escalated to him throwing me into walls, pulling chairs out from underneath me, stealing my stuff, and other things. When I was 12 my mum was also diagnosed with breast cancer at the same time my grandmother died from the exact same illness, leading me to believe my mum was going to die. I developed depression at this age, but kept quiet, thinking I was going mad. My depression and anxiety kept getting worse, until year 9 when, for a period of 8 months, I was sexually abused on an almost daily basis at school. After this ended I began cutting myself to cope, I had been getting therapy for a few months at this point but I never mentioned the sexual abuse. I also began getting bullied pretty badly again for a year and a half, carrying into year 10. My cutting worsened and I began having mood swings. I would scream and jump on tables and throw stuff around, talking very fast with all these thoughts running through my head, then I would crash in a heap, feeling worse than ever before. I also began getting fluctuating emotions towards others, either feeling an extreme attachment to them or hating them and wanting to be left alone, I was constantly wanting to run away from home, I was flirting with death, tying a noose and hanging myself only to pull out just before I lost consciousness, taking too many pills after an anxiety attack to see what would happen, standing on the edge of a 5 storey carpark and crying my eyes out, praying for the strength to throw myself off, crossing roads and stopping in the middle, screaming for the cars to hit me, I was losing my mind and I was so scared. My grades plummeted, I began missing more and more school, I was cutting and burning a billion times every day, eventually my parents found out from a friend I had spoken to that I had a noose in my room and I was so close to using it. They kept me off school for 6 weeks, in which time I went clean from cutting, eventually relapsing and carving words into myself for the first proper time. My cutting came back into full force, I was cutting deeper and more and carving words more often, my emotions were everywhere and I was losing it, I kept worrying that I was being filmed, I kept thinking my parents were fake, actors who planned to kill me, every time a car came by my house I thought it was someone planning to gun me down, eventually this year I went to hospital, I got out a week ago and now I'm still as confused as ever about my mental illnesses. I don't know what I have, I don't know if I'm psychotic or not, but I know what I'm going through is much more than just depression and anxiety. Does what I've been through sound familiar to anybody?

username#01261,post,1665396089.0,Reese is ADHD-coded,"As someone diagnosed with autism and ADHD, I definitely see ADHD in Reese. He is hyperactive to the point of being destructive and constantly shows dopamine-seeking behaviors that get him into trouble. He's always trying to push the limits to do crazy stuff. He does poorly in school partly because of this and because he never wants to do his homework. He doesn't learn the material because he can't focus, or because he is focusing on something else. He is highly interest-driven and impulsive, and lacks restraint/impulse control. He does things to hurt other people because it makes him laugh and brings him satisfaction.

Dopamine-seeking is one of the main biochemical mechanisms behind ADHD. People with ADHD don't receive the proper amount of dopamine from doing daily tasks like self care, chores, or homework, which makes it incredibly hard to do those things or focus on doing them. Often, we'd much rather do the things that bring us higher amounts of dopamine, like certain hobbies, video games, or spending time online. ADHD people are usually very interest-driven and can lack impulse control because of this.

Reese just does whatever sounds good to him and whatever will give him the most satisfaction. He doesn't make any time for the things he deems boring, like personal hygiene and cleaning his room, which is super textbook ADHD in my opinion.

I know many people also speculate about Malcolm and Dewey having autism. It's honestly fun to speculate stuff about fictional characters. Personally, I don't see any of the characters being autistic. They might have a few traits, sure, but a few traits of something doesn't mean they have it.

username#01261,post,1620976127.0,Having misconceptions about panic attacks,"I want to preface that I just recently was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. That is my first diagnosis so far, but I have always had issues with anxiety and take meds for it. I thought it was just generalized, but now I'm not so sure. I'm of course going to discuss this right away with my psychiatrist, but I just wanted to hear other's input or similar experiences.

Basically, I think that what I've always considered ""anxiety"" may actually be smaller panic attacks. My heart beats fast, I get a severe anxious feeling in my chest/stomach, I feel like I'm going to die, sometimes I get dizzy or shaky or feel like I'm going to throw up. Then that feeling fades and I will usually still feel anxious after, which is why I thought it is all just one continuous stream of anxiety. Someone else in another recent post described exactly what I've been feeling regarding experiencing all this as soon as you wake up. I don't feel this every single day, and sometimes when I don't have many stressors in my life, I hardly feel anxious at all. But when I do, I feel this relentlessly for more days than not.

I've had a small handful of really debilitating panic attacks in my life that lasted for hours. Uncontrollable crying, body tingling, room spinning, the whole 9 yards. I thought up until recently that every panic attack had to be that bad in order to qualify as one. Now I know that's not true and I am really evaluating how I experience anxiety. I've had 2 distinct panic attacks alone today, but thankfully they were fairly mild and lasted around 20 minutes. They've been getting worse lately and that's why I think I've finally noticed it instead of just brushing it off as regular old anxiety.

Anyway, my question is has anyone else taken a long time to realize their panic attacks because of misconceptions about what the attacks truly are? Any words of similarity or advice would be much appreciated.",panicdisorder,diagnosed with\s*(bipolar),

Obviously none of us here can diagnose or undiagnose you, but I would highly, highly recommend seeking a second opinion.

Neither of those worked for me, but another antipsychotic, Seroquel (Quetiapine), has worked wonders. I was prescribed it for non autism-related reasons, but it's had the unintentional benefit of helping phenomenally with my autism symptoms. I rarely get meltdowns anymore, my severe sensory issues are more moderate, I hit/scratch myself much less, I'm calmer in general, etc.

I definitely recommend talking to your child's doctor/finding a pediatric psychiatrist who works with autism. Of course, meds affect everyone differently, but the right ones can be life-changing. A professional would most likely start with either Abilify or Risperdal, but if those don't work out, there are plenty of other options.

username#01261,comment,1695022525.0,,"The autism level system isn't about how much you personally struggle, it's about your specific needs in 2 domains: social communication, and restrictive/repetitive behaviors. Most autistic people struggle greatly, no matter their level. Struggling a lot doesn't necessarily make you a higher level.

It's also very important to remember that needs vary within each level. Some level 1 autistics don't need much support at all, while others need more in order to live independently. Some level 2s can live independently with a lot of support, while others need constant help just to stay alive. Some level 3s can read, write, and post on social media, while others can't use an AAC board and have no functional language whatsoever.

I am diagnosed as level 2 because my ability to read social cues is cognitively on the same level as a toddler's. I pop blood vessels all over my body from scratching during meltdowns and give myself ear infections from hitting myself in the head. I can't work, can't drive, can't feed myself, can't attend school, and can't live alone. I have uncontrollable echolalia which means I repeat things others say that I have no control over. I am visibly autistic to everyone I meet. It is incredibly hard for me to make and keep friends. I physically cannot read if I'm not also flapping my hands and rocking. As a young child, I could not be kept in daycare because I'd have severe meltdowns. I had to be homeschooled all the way through high school.

To me, level 2 feels isolating and like no one understands me, but I can't really understand others either. I have to take high doses of antipsychotic medication to control my autistic outbursts, irritability, and /severe/ sensory issues. A lot of days feel like I am in a living hell due to my autism.

But, I still possess immense privelege over level 3 autistics. I can sometimes mask my autistic behaviors for my own safety, I can often carry conversations, and I can maintain a few close friendships. I don't need the constant watch of a caregiver in order to stay alive. I have learned how to sometimes tell when I'm hungry or need to use the bathroom. I'm no longer incontinent like I was for a very long time. I could attend school even though it was homeschool. I possess and can utilize functional language, and so on.

So, just a reminder, the levels are simply meant to describe the kind of support someone needs. It's not a gauge of how much a person does or doesn't struggle. I know it's hard not to compare yourself to other level 1 autistics, but needs can vary quite a lot within each level.

username#01261,comment,1694601335.0,,"For months during and following my last psychotic break, I had pretty severe alogia. I was constantly slurring my words, mixing things up, stuttering, being unable to speak in complete sentences, or not being able to talk at all. Months of being stable on a high dose of Seroquel and I still stutter and struggle to respond, but no longer slur my words. My speech is overall a lot better, and time has been the main factor in my speech improving.

I am incredibly lucky because I have been in my relationship long before my most recent psychotic break, and I have a very kind and understanding partner. During the psychotic break though, it really put a strain on our relationship because of my extreme communication difficulties. It required a lot of patience and understanding from my partner. So to directly answer your question, yes I have been able to maintain a relationship while struggling with alogia. But, it was very difficult.

My best advice to you would be to explore alternative forms of communication that you can possibly use whenever you need to. It may seem strange at first, but it could help you communicate whenever you need that extra help.

I also have autism, and in the autistic community, it's very common for people to use AAC: Augmentative and Alternative Communication. AAC is for ANYONE who thinks they would benefit from it, no matter who you are! People with all kinds of conditions use AAC. Sign language is even considered a form of it.

Some forms of AAC include:

Communication cards - this is a physical deck of cards that have common words on them. You can choose one or point to it when you need something, like water, or want to communicate an emotion, like happiness or fear. These can be purchased almost anywhere online. Amazon Prime has tons of options.

Text to speech apps - this is just any app that reads text out loud. I personally use this one a lot! I often type better than I can speak, and this option solves the speaking problem for me. You can type whatever you want and it will be read out loud. Also, you can input common words or phrases to save for later when you need them.

AAC boards - This one is hard to explain, so here's an example to show you what I mean. [Communication Board Example](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.communicationcommunity.com/how-to-make-a-communication-board/amp/)
An AAC board can be a physical piece of paper/cardboard that has common symbols, actions, words, or letters on it. This is very similar to communication cards. You just point to what you want to say.
An AAC board can also be digital. There are plenty of apps to choose from. ""Coughdrop"" is a great free option. You just download the program onto your phone or tablet and make selections that are then read out loud. You can also customize the options to fit your needs.

username#01261,comment,1694589569.0,,"As someone who's suffered from bipolar 1 since adolescence, I'm in the same boat as you and I appreciate you making this post. It's an important message you're spreading. I've said and done a lot of incredibly unhinged things while manic, most of which I have no recollection of. I was absolutely out of my mind.

That being said, comparing bipolar disorder to schizophrenia and saying nothing else gets that kind of poor treatment is just not fair. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia in addition to bipolar disorder and trust me, I'm not treated any better by people for my schizophrenia. People don't cut me any slack for either of my conditions. To general society, we are all just ""crazy people"" with no distinctions. We need to stick together.

Schizophrenia absolutely, without a doubt, gets this same exact kind of disdainful treatment. I have posted publicly ONE time on Instagram about having schizophrenia in the name of spreading awareness. Following this, I have received countless DMs from trolls saying horrible things and making terrifying threats to try to trigger me into psychosis. I have also posted multiple times about my bipolar disorder prior to this, and while I've got a handful of ableist responses, they are not on the same level of the hatred I've got for simply talking about my schizophrenia.

I have (now deceased) family members with much more severe schizophrenia than I do, who have spent their entire lives in and out of institutions facing life-threatening abuse that has sent them to the ICU on the brink of death.

I am not trying to play a game of ""who has it worse"" because that's also harmful and unproductive. All I'm saying is please don't discount schizophrenia just because you have not personally experienced it. Schizophrenics do not have it easier and most of the time we don't get the vital accommodations we need, either. Bipolar and schizophrenia share a lot of similar struggles and stigma.",BipolarReddit,my\s*(bipolar),
username#01261,comment,1654839849.0,,"Responding to each of your questions:

- I grew up not having any clue I was autistic and this really made my life so much harder than it had to be. Most of all, I just wish my parents had told me ""this is why you feel different from everyone else all the time."" It would have saved me so much heartache and loneliness.


- My diagnosis was eventually straight up given to me by the professional who diagnosed me. I actually preferred this, but everyone is different of course. I will note: how those around him initially act toward his diagnosis, how they talk about it, etc. is incredibly crucial in shaping his feelings toward being Autistic, his self esteem, and more.


- I'm not sure about resources for children, but for parents, I could not more highly recommend listening to #actuallyautistic voices online. There are many great Instagram pages from autistic creators, for instance, where they explain what autism is from someone with lived experience. Learning from these creators has been incredibly helpful for myself in understanding and accepting being Autistic. It's just a great resource for anyone wanting to learn more or better understand autistic traits, struggles, and strengths.

My top 3 recommendations on Instagram are:

a. neurodivergent_lou

b. stimmy__autie

c. neuro_divers (they have a recent post titled ""processing a diagnosis"")


- I can't think of any funny stories right now, sorry! But something that helps me excel in my field of interests is how passionate I am. I am very passionate and get so excited about my special interests when I get to tell someone else about them. (Special interest is another term for the ""repetitive/restricted interests"" criteria.)


- What makes me feel better is ranting to a close friend about how I feel, someone who validates my feelings and helps me move past them. Every autistic's communication is different though, so what helps me may be stressful for others.


- The few friends that I have love me for who I actually am, which means the world to me. It means that I can have meltdowns or sensory overload or go nonverbal or stim in front of them (rocking, hand flapping, etc.) and they know that this is just who I am and accept me for it.


- In my personal opinion, it would be great for the parents to help their son realize and pay attention to when someone says something that makes him feel bad. That's something I still have trouble recognizing until much later after the situation had passed, and I realize that I did not stand up for myself at all. It's hard to catch in the moment, but when you learn to recognize it, you can communicate it to others (whether that's through speech, ASL, AAC, communication cards, anything).


- I grew up going to church and religious high schools. I've found that Christianity is just not for me and I've never been truly accepted for who I am in that kind of religious environment. So I don't feel that religion has empowered me or my perspective. That is only my experience of course, and everyone is different.

Something for parents to watch out for is people in the church ""praying for their son to be healed"" and that sort of thing. Autism isn't an illness or something to be fixed. If a higher power suddenly ""healed"" me of my Autism, I would not be ME anymore, because Autism is a fundamental part of my identity and how I see the world. While people who say these things usually mean well, the message autistic people internalize from this is a harmful one that makes us feel like who we are is fundamentally wrong.
So anything along the lines of being ""healed"" or phrases like ""people are autistic as a result of sin, just like other sicknesses or disabilities are made by sin"" are very icky beliefs that are ultimately harmful and something to watch out for.

Also, thank you for encouraging your friend to stay away from autism speaks! I'm sure her son will start off on the right track with good advice and people looking out for him, and continue to grow as the amazing Autistic human that he already is.

Of course, most people hate my reaction to arbitrary rules and requirements like that. I'm not rude about it, but I think a lot of allistic people find me questioning the rule or my bluntness rude. Situations like that are sometimes a lose-lose for me because of communication differences.

I really don't see this kind of thing as a lack of emotional maturity. I feel like enforcing arbitrary rules and saying ""because I told you so"" for their reason seems pretty pointless and immature. It's usually a power structure thing, and you get in trouble for questioning it. At least, in my experience.

username#00491,post,1655760649.0,"I grew up enduring maternal abuse, bullying, sexual molestation, and now schizophrenia. This is my story","Long story and my memory is awful so I’ll try to keep it as short ap as I recall everything. I’m(26m) a struggling artist trying to even find the motivation to keep going in my artwork and life as a whole. I was born to a couple trying fertilization therapies because my mother wanted a baby after suffering repeated miscarriages before and after I was born. 13 total miscarries. So fast forward a few years I was always treated as both the “miracle child” and the disappointment. Anything I did wrong was met with extreme screaming to the point of her eyes becoming bloodshot and her face a deep red. I was a bit of a bed wetter, so that was met with screaming from that as well. She would throw my toys around and at me when I left a mess. Lock me in my room for hours at a time at her random discretion. Particularly so I wouldn’t “bother her” one example I had an obvious UTI had trouble peeing and made frequent trips to the bathroom so she locked me in my bedroom until the morning because I was “bothering her.” She called these rages “momma meanie attacks” she would sometimes apologize to me afterwards and at this point in my life I’m unable to forgive her for any of them despite having said I did in the past. Because none of it ever changed. 

Transition to the sa: When I was around 4 I went to a new pediatrician and was sexually molested by him privately until after I started puberty and was moved to a gp. I only know that I said no to him the first few times and was ignored every time. Thats all I can remember besides flashes of moments when it happened.

I should also mention that the day-care center I was placed in while my mom worked there also acted in an abusive manner. Excluding me from activities, neglecting basic needs, and allowing other children to bully and pick on me. Added onto that I was bullied in school up until high school for being different. I was always quiet, acted somewhat uniquely to other kids around me due to having an ADD diagnosis around 3rd grade

Now back to my mom:
Her pattern of praise->neglect->abuse->apology would continue while my Dad was away on frequent business trips for work until I was about 13. He has always been always a good dad, stern, but fair and loving and had no idea the extent of what she had been putting me through even when he was home. She would spend his money to the point of extreme debt on mostly herself, the house, me, and movies she would watch while in her depressive states. Around 13 it was discovered by my Father that she was cheating and he kicked her ass out. But for some reason I kept a relationship with her. She lied to me, manipulating me into thinking he had cheated on her and caused strain between me and him. That has since been repaired with a lot of effort on my end.
Ff to schizophrenia: I was beginning training to become a cop with my goal set to becoming a homicide detective and around 20, I experienced my first hallucination. I was working at my local grocery store and cut myself while slicing a watermelon. Before I realized what was happening, blood began pouring from the walls, the ceiling, the floor. In my panic, I ran to the bathroom to wash up, looking in the mirror only to be met with blood coming from my eyes, mouth, nose, fingernails. Etc. then the screams started. Disembodied Voices cursing my name and everything about me, surrounding me with hurtful words and angry thoughts that were not my own. I hid in the bathroom until the end of my shift still haunted with these auditory hallucinations. It only got worse and more frequent from there. After a few months and some psychiatric treatment, I was placed on permanent disability and found myself unable to work, making $500 a month from disability checks and thats it. I haven’t been able to gain a reasonably functional life since. I am trying. I’ve been with my fiancé for 5years now trying my best to live normally, but I’ve got no clue what to do next can’t find an affordable therapist that accepts medicaid or medicare in my area. I take my meds but they don’t work. So idfk what to do. I did find out my mother was diagnosed with BPD and after some more bs and strain from her ignoring my boundaries and needs/refusing to accept I even have them, I went full NC with her and even clapped back some in a harsh way on my way out.  

If anyone has any idea on how to help find a therapist in my area, I would love a dm.

I'm a huge liar. I lie all the time, about pretty much everything. Just yesterday, my therapist called me (as we agreed) to make sure that I had done the thing I told her I would do. ""Yeah, didn't even take long!"" -- so that was a fucking lie. And then later, when the nurses who come over to my apartment to make sure I take my insulin and stuff (type 1 diabetes) I lied about my blood glucose levels. They were high, which is bad, like really bad, and I was just like ""Yeah, they're 12.4"" or something that's in my target value.

I have no reason to do this. My therapist will not scorn me for not being able to do the thing, and the nurses would probably not scorn me as well for having high blood glucose. I just want to please them. It's weird, like in my only relationship (which ended like one-and-a-half years ago) I lied all the time.

Next day I did nothing but threw up until I had to be taken to a hospital. 24 hours of intravenous drip and I was free. At this point the festival was basically over, all I could do was go pack up my stuff and go home.

There was still a light, though. I was invited to a friends cabin that evening when I got home, and most of my closest friends would be there. And I went. And then I came back home, because there I was overwhelmed by a horrible feeling of being an outsider. Of not belonging there, to be with my oldest friends. They all recounted some funny things that had happened when they were together the last time, but in absolutely none of these storied did I have a part in.

I had criticized myself too harshly, and hadn't noticed how well I actually work with people. The only exception being people of the opposite sex.

username#00505,comment,1697866569.0,,"100%. I’m a PhD in Neuroscience working mostly on neuropsychiatric pathologies and development of treatment for them. And I am diagnosed with schizophrenia, so I’ll try and attempt to explain my opinion on this question from my experiences and help out here. 

Unfortunately for me, my relatives are heavily diagnosed with bipolar and schizophrenia, so it only seems fair to assume that I had a strong genetic predisposition. But the horrid degree of abuse in my early childhood lead - or I believe at least have been a strong contributor - to me developing early onset schizophrenia, having my first episode of psychosis when I was 9 years old. And even more unfortunate, my little sister developed early onset paranoid schizophrenia when she was only 6 years old, who I then had to care for while trying to hold my shit together handling my own severe psychosis. While I think it’s difficult to know for sure, but I believe that we most likely would have developed schizophrenia at a more appropriate age later in life given our genetic ticket being so robust. My understanding now is that as the previous statement is most likely true, the trauma and ever-present violence at home definitely brought about the early presentation of schizophrenia for both of us - and lead us to have the traumatic sequence of experiences representing just how difficult it is to develop and then live with schizophrenia as a child, especially with no support other than each other. So all in all, I think trauma of that magnitude can epigenetically trigger the early onset of schizophrenia and similar pathologies, leading to a child having to suffer through psychosis while they are still in the process of developing as a human being, and for me that very process was absolutely brutal to battle and live through that, if the condition were to be developed as an adult, one that wouldn’t have to become a lived experience. So all in all, the childhood abuse can trigger early onset of schizophrenia and traumatized a child by forcing them to deal with psychosis before they are an adult - I hope that sort of makes sense.

It’s an amazingly interesting progression and experience now looking at it all from a neuroscience perspective looking for treatment strategies, this is definitely something I could talk a lot about with my weird combination of neuropsychiatric pathology and expertise in neuroscience haha",schizophrenia,diagnosed with\s*(bipolar),

I’m a 24F, and I’ve never dated or had any romantic experience even though I’m athletic and fairly attractive. My autism is a man-repellant.

Whenever I have a crush on someone, I act cold; as if I dislike them. The more emotions I feel, the more “blank” I seem. The advice I was given on the dating subreddit was, “Just tell him you like him!” 

That’s easier said than done when you have difficulty speaking coherently in stressful situations. All masking goes out the window. When I like someone I find it really hard to even make eye contact. I don’t know how I can confess my feelings without breathing hard, looking away, and stuttering incoherently (trust me it’s not cute).

Men in real life aren’t interested. I don’t think it’s my looks, because I got a lot of interest when I tried online dating apps (that’s something I can’t deal with now). 

I think it might be the fact that I cannot flirt or express interest without appearing weird or crazy, or fearful. I never learned to mask due to homeschooling. Maybe I also never get interest because I dress for comfort more than looks. And maybe mostly because I would spend a lot of time in my room for studying. 

I did go on one online date and I got along really well with a guy who said he didn’t care about my autism or other mental issues. He really liked me and even talked about taking me to meet his mom in the near future. But after our first date, he ghosted me.

From what I have seen, autistic men tend to have this problem more. It’s rare that I find an autistic woman who has this problem. But I could be wrong. If you are an autistic woman who is dating someone, how did you get to meet? How do you express interest?",AutisticAdults,my\s*(autism),
username#00509,post,1693084706.0,The case for self-diagnosis (from a former critic),"I’ve seen a lot of people discussing the ethics of self-diagnosis, and I wanted to share my perspective as someone who was formerly an ardent opponent of self-diagnosis. This will not be an exhaustive essay, since the same points are constantly rehashed. I want to share both my perspective and some issues I do not think are often considered.

I saw a lot of people on Tik Tok discussing autism, and I assumed it was one of those weird fads like the Tourette’s fakers and DID roleplayers. I was disgusted. I used to think that “real autism” would always be detected from a young age, and that it would be obvious to any parent and professional. I didn’t believe that someone could make it to teen years undiagnosed. But now I think these people are onto something… there seems to have been a lot of people being missed, and part of this realization was that I am one of them.

A benefit of self-diagnosis of autism is finding an online community where you can share tips and experiences without fear of judgement or being fake-claimed. So much of the research I have done with the understanding that I have autism has been life-changing.

I often see folks talking about how self-diagnosed people are taking away resources from diagnosed autistics… but this just isn’t true. The only resources being taken by the self-diagnosed are fidget toys!

Self-diagnosis means a more efficient and fair use of resources: I see a lot of people getting a diagnosis for the sole purpose of validation. I do not think this is wrong (I think there needs to be more resources), however this does cause problems for people who need a diagnosis for accommodations. It is now very hard for people to get a diagnosis since wait lists are so long. It’s ridiculous to expect people to get a thousand-dollar assessment, and a diagnosis that will increase your life insurance payments, just to be allowed to make posts about autism on Reddit.

Self-diagnosis can correct professionals, who are currently not the best at spotting neurodevelopmental disabilities in anyone who isn’t a young child. People are being medicated for anxiety and depression without getting to the root of the issue. And bipolar is a favorite diagnosis. My meltdowns were described as a bipolar symptom, despite me never having had a mood episode.

Lastly, normal people do not want to be unique. I used to think people diagnosed themselves because they were “boring neurotypicals who want to be special,” but in reality, no NT craves being different. And really, self-diagnoses don’t want to be different or special. We want to know that we AREN’T special, or alone, or the only person in the world who struggles a certain way. There will be fakers, but fakers always have some sort of psychological issue going on.

If you still think self-diagnosis is wrong, I respect your opinion. I don’t care if people think I am a fake autistic person or a liar, because I know myself well enough now to know I’ve been through enough.",autism,i have\s*(autism); diagnosis of\s*(autism); diagnosed\s*(autistic),

A lot of autistic people are into LGBT and more tend to be into some more uhhh “creative” religions. I think there are spiritual advantages and disadvantages to being autistic.

Disadvantages: I can see a lot of us being hurt by the church. I was alienated by my peers at church because of autism. I was also gender dysphoric from a young age (I grew out of it thankfully), and my first feelings were for girls so I was SSA for a while as well. I have schizophrenia (comorbidity) and both that, meltdowns, and self-harm can be quite a spiritual hurdle. 

Advantages: Apologetics was a special interest for me. It turned out to be a way to bond with other autistic Christians with the same interest. Since I’ve been alienated as a default, I’m not a “friend of the world,” and I can preach the gospel without fear.

This past year and a half has been the most crushing of all the years of my life.

I used to be angry at God for what He allowed me to go through. I didn’t understand why this was necessary for His plan, and I felt tortured by Him. But I have found their is a purpose in our suffering. God promises Christians that all things will ultimately work for our good. There are many verses all throughout the Bible that speak on how God uses suffering to strengthen us in the faith. Paul says “in my weakness, He is strong!” Job is an excellent book to read. The basic idea is that we cannot understand what God does. All of humanity probably doesn’t know 1% of what there is to know in the world, but God does.

You might feel broken down, but sometimes that breaking part happens right before you become much stronger spiritually. Right now I’m suffering and humiliated more than I have in my life, but I am also more trusting of God, no matter what happens.

Lifes been hard recently, my dads away for months, I’m sick and dealing with migraines from past head trauma, and my mom is constantly overwhelmed, stressed, and repeatedly shuts down throughout the day. She’ll get in her car sometimes and just drive somewhere, leaving me home with my siblings to care for.

My brother, also, has just been a pain in my ass. We’ve never had the best relationship, I don’t view him like my brother- he’s just a guy in my house. I don’t hate him, atleast I don’t think so, but he’s just been getting in my nerves so much.

He pisses his pant, his bed constantly this past week. He knows not to, but he does it for attention. He hits his head, throws himself in the floor, destroys his room and wails and moans when doesn’t get want he wants.

Yesterday, when my mom was in the shower and my brothers throwing a fit. He’s throwing himself on the ground and crying. I tried to console him and give him his milk and pick him up, but that’s when in happened. He grabbed my hair, kept yanking it, and as I screamed and tried to get him off me, he bit my arm near my wrist. It felt like a dog almost, and in the moment I punched him in the  face a few times and stomped on his leg so he’d let me go.

My sister got my mom, explained what happened, and now I’m in trouble for it. If I’m honest I wasn’t even thinking, I just acted on reflex. I was scared and my brother is much bigger and stronger than me. And he’s fine, I know his nose was bleeding a bit and he has like some bruising on his leg but he’s fine. 

I don’t know what to do, at all. I’m scared to call my dad because I know he’ll be angry at me, my mom is upset at me and my sister is always siding with her. I don’t think what I did was wrong, and I don’t feel bad about it at all, but I feel like I should.

username#00526,post,1659788821.0,Since my diagnosis at 28 I'm now realising how much sensory seeking I've been doing throughout my life & how allowing myself to find what I like has benefited me immensely,"When I was preparing for my assessment several months ago I had to fill out a lot of forms with the relevant background information in each category.

There was a category for self stimulatory behaviours. I started at around age 2 because that's as far back as I remember. Even throughout my assessment at times I was struggling to think of all the ways I feel like I stim but only recently have I realised how stimming is actually integral to who I've always been.

I would always rock my waist, legs and feet to help me fall asleep, something I still do now and can't not do it. I would hold my ear close to certain sounds such as the buzzing sound my lullaby frog made when I held my ear close to where the motor was located in his head. I got more satisfaction from listening to a monotone buzzing sound than I did from the actual lullaby the frog played. 

I thought about all of the other stimming behaviours I had as a kid. I used to spin around a lot, bounce on my feet & put pressure on different body parts especially my hands. I also used to love to skip & pace. As I got a bit older there was a lot of vocal stimming (mostly repeating lines from the TV).

My stimming, when in the presence of others, became quite subtle in my teens. Shaking my leg, using my hand to put different pressures on my other hand and fingers, things like that. When I was at home though I felt more comfortable to let the vocal stims out and to an extent the more ""bouncy"" stims.

So anyway, I was officially diagnosed with Autism and since then I've slowly been processing what it all means for me. These last few months I have been making small changes in my life so I can accommodate my needs better and this has included exploring stimming a bit more.

The other day I was feeling particularly anxious when I was in my room so I took my wolf figurine off my desk and began rotating it in my hands in different directions and at various speeds. I can't really explain it but it felt really really good to do this. I think it was probably a combination of the fact that the wolf is one of my favourite things I have in my room & the fact that I'd forgotten I used to stim in a similar way as a kid. I would stare at objects & move them around (closer or further from my eyes) in a repetitive way.

This was an amazing discovery for me because I had forgotten and didn't think I had much of a reaction to visual stims.

Another example of exploring stimming lately has been paying more attention to my environment on walks. I realise now how much sound & visuals can transport me to another world in my mind. I would go so far as to describe it as a meditative state when I find the right source of stimulation. There was an airshow down by the beach/cliffs last week so I took my dog, honestly not thinking I'd enjoy it. But watching the planes, helicopters and emergency vehicles navigate the sky and even doing tricks was incredible and I stayed for over an hour. As I watched the planes I was also tuning into the sound of the waves, the wind and the rest of nature.

I've noticed when I'm overwhelmed I definitely seek out certain sensory input and the sounds of nature seems to be the one that calms me the most. Getting my diagnosis has meant I now understand these feelings and needs so now I can address them & I find that overall I am less overwhelmed these days because I know that stimming is something that regulates me.

I just wanted to share this because I feel that even though I always suspected I was autistic I'm still learning so much about what that means specifically for me and how I navigate the world. It has not been an easy journey being so different (especially socially) from everyone else but discovering all these other parts of myself has been rewarding in its own way.",AutisticAdults,diagnosed with\s*(autism),X
username#00526,post,1658433763.0,I'm struggling to not get involved in imaginary arguments in my head,"I've had this issue for a while now and I'm not sure whether it is intrusive in nature or whether it relates more to perseveration of thoughts (or both)

Basically I have a hard time letting things go. People's words stick in my mind long after they have said them. Sometimes I will remember a specific event where someone else upset me and then imagine me responding differently.

However this isn't 'exactly' what I've been dealing with lately.

My problem is that my mind has been creating imaginary scenarios and then I find myself getting involved in these imaginary arguments in my head. I know though, that these imaginary arguments are inspired by feelings I have in real life.

For example my parent, since I've been diagnosed, had continued on as if I were never diagnosed. They continue to make decisions spur of the moment and expect me to immediately start doing whatever they've suddenly decided, without any time for me to process. I always do it anyway however it effects me really badly and literally hurts my brain. I become mute and overwhelmed and it can ruin my entire day.

So this kind of situation has created a lot of frustration in me & lately I've found myself imagining confronting my parent in various different ways. Explaining things from my perspective. Having them actually listen and consider that this experience (that doesn't effect them) effects me greatly because of my autism. That I don't choose for certain things to effect me the way they do. But at the end of the day my imagination does not reflect the reality (unfortunately) and expressing my needs usually ends in invalidation and hurtful things being said to me (which start this cycle all over as I replay the words in my head)

I'm just really really exhausted. I can feel my mental health getting worse which is bad because I've been doing so well for 9+ months now.

So I want to ask. What can I do? There's a part of me that feels these imaginary arguments aren't entirely voluntary and they come to me in an intrusive nature and once they start they loop in my head for a long time.

I also want to ask is this common? Do other people do this? They get hurt in real life or they are constantly invalidated so they imagine the other person actually listening to them for once?

I know it's a rant but I need to get it off my chest.",AutisticAdults,my\s*(autism),
username#00526,comment,1666911621.0,,"I highly recommend the podcast. It's called Being In the Way and I listen to it on Spotify but I think it's also on YouTube, Apple etc.

It explores the Alan Watts archives which has 100 hours of taped recordings from his lectures. There's usually an intro by Alan's son Mark Watts and some episodes I believe have other people speaking on the subject too.

But honestly discovering Alan Watts changed my life immensely. I used to go for walks for hours and listen to his lectures as I walked in nature. Not only is his voice really soothing but the way he explores his ideas and conjures up imagery and connections is just beautiful.

Another work by Alan I'd recommend is Out of Your Mind. I downloaded it on Audible because although I'd like to read more of his books I love listening to him speak. And it would definitely be a good pre-bedtime listen too.

I hope you hear back about your psych testing results soon. I only got my autism diagnosis back in May (at 28 years old) and although I pretty much knew that would be the result, having it confirmed changed a lot for me and overall improved many things I had been struggling with prior. I always think it's great to explore and learn as much as you can about the particular way your mind works and functions because then you can implement changes to make things work better for you :)",AutisticAdults,my\s*(autism),

It is absolutely fine to celebrate your differences & find the good things about how your brain works but not at the expense of shutting down anyone who isn't always enjoying or embracing being autistic.

If you're having difficulties in life because of your autism, speaking about those things does not mean you are saying autism is an inherently bad thing.

Once I said ""I have autism"" instead of ""I am autistic"" and other autistics sent me literal essays explaining how wrong I was. I don't get it. It's my preference to say I'm autistic or I have autism I'm not going to start considering every possibly interpretation of my words before I say them.

I know this particular example isn't what you are referring to but for me it was the beginning of me realising that sometimes the community itself does not feel inclusive. I find that there is little space for discussions because the majority or the loudest voices have already decided what the right views are.

It's one reason why I had to step away from the main autism sub. It's that kind of toxic positivity you mentioned.

I think my shutdowns can last much longer than the event that triggered them (unfortunately) and when I have an episode where I am mute it can actually take a few days for that feeling of being stuck inside my head to pass. 

Shutdown and going mute as part of that probably makes more sense to me than selective mutism even if they can seem like the same thing, the cause is based around my autism rather than my anxiety.

Another one was ""autistics can't feel empathy"". Even though I can be emotionally cold which people often mistake for a lack of empathy, I consider myself to be highly empathetic.

It was only when I started talking to other autistics online, that I learnt that the spectrum is vast. From there I began to learn about all the ways someone can be autistic and realised many of the little things I've done throughout my life turned out to be part of my autism. So because of the old views professionals had an how autism manifested I went through many unnecessary years of never seeking a diagnosis because I convinced myself that the absence of certain behaviours disqualified me.

username#00549,post,1642634701.0,I'm pretty sure I delayed getting proper treatment by misunderstanding EDS & denying I had it for years,"I'm autistic & was fully aware that EDS is fairly common among people on the spectrum. Strangers on the autism related subreddits have even suggested I might have EDS whenever I'd bring up symptoms. But when I Googled it, I saw pictures of contortionists & thought ""Yeah, I can't bend like that"" & immediately wrote it off. And I'm a fan of RuPaul's Drag Race, so I saw Yvie on there describing EDS & watched them doing all of these crazy moves & it just cemented the idea that I didn't have it.

But a few days ago a stranger from the aspergers sub messaged me after seeing a comment & going through my post history, encouraging me to look into EDS again. So after an annoyed groan, I did. And the more I read, the more plausible it seemed. And when I finally understood what constitutes as hypermobility, I realized that I had it, but it was only noticeable in my hands, feet, jaw, knees, & waist. I always thought it was weird that despite chronic pain & stiffness, I could still bend over & touch the floor.

Other obvious but missed signs: I used to dislocate my shoulders & chase other kids for fun. Another favorite past time was cramming my body into tiny spaces to show off. I remember when I was 16, one of my friends bet me I couldn't fit in his dryer & I totally did.

I've also been going to chiropractors since I was a teenager & managed to baffle every single one when they'd fix a subluxation & 2 days later the joint would slide right back out for no discernable reason.

Baffling doctors. Story of my freaking life right there.

I found the diagnostic material on the main EDS website & surpass the minimum requirements needed for diagnosis, so I passed it on to my doctor. I realized that I probably have MCAS & POTS too, because I've always had weird allergic reactions that even an allergist & gastroenterologist couldn't explain. Plus my blood pressure bounces around so much that I have no idea what's even normal for me.

A few weeks ago my doctor found a chiari malformation while looking for pituitary tumors (there weren't any) which also appears to be a thing that could be related to EDS. I was referred to a neurologist that I'm scheduled to see in March. I'm also 99% sure I've been having focal seizures, so I've probably got epilepsy too, but won't know for certain until I get an EEG.

The only thing I'm still confused by is that I seem to have fluctuating hypopituitarism, but a cosyntropin test just came back normal, so I'm clueless on that one. The only things I can think of is either temporal lobe seizures are making my endocrine system act funny, the chiari might be pressing against something, or the chronic stress from dealing with so much has triggered some kind of HPA axis dysfunction & I need to find better ways to calm down.

My mom has ADHD & is extremely narcissistic. She was absent for a good chunk of my childhood & only decided to take on the mom role after having another kid.

They divorced when I was 7 & eventually married other people & started new families. So from age 12+ I got to listen to both of them telling me how great their new kids were & how each of them were ""raising them the right way this time"", so I just felt like this failed experiment that was shelved in favor of the new, improved models.

It spread to other family members too. I'd visit my grandparents or an aunt or uncle & they'd have pictures hanging of my siblings but not me. And somehow all of my mood & behavioral problems were my own fault because I was lazy & self-centered.

I started doing cosplay & picking a lot of horror related characters, or characters that required mask or prop making. Except I live on the brink of poverty, so I can't afford nice materials to work with. And now that cosplay is huge & not just for ultra-nerds, everyone looks like a model & they have expensive 3D printers & worbla & custom print fabric.

username#00549,comment,1647075449.0,,"I've dealt with a lot of similar issues, but have been somewhat fortunate to have people support me. I lived at home until I was 23 & finally moved out with my then-boyfriend. The relationship was pretty toxic, but the relationship with my mom was worse, so I spent 3 years living with him & when he moved out, my best friend (who ended up becoming my husband) moved in & we've been together for 10 years now. So I've always had somebody to split rent & housework with. Which is great, because I've never been able to handle full-time work. I tried pretty much everything. I bounced around between so many jobs. I think I had over 20. And while I enjoyed some of them, the people always ruined it. I always worked too slow or didn't meet quotas, or I was too quiet & never wanted to participate in potlucks or team exercises, leading to people thinking I was a bitch & being nasty towards me.

I ended up having a major burnout after hitting 30 & my pain got worse. I've had issues with my joints since I was a kid, but they didn't start bothering me until I got a job requiring physical labor. Then I was at the chiropractor all the time. But I was still able to power through. But I swear, when 30 hit, suddenly I had issues with all of my joints & started to get muscle aches & stiffness & so much fatigue. My depression started going off the rails. I tried to apply for disability then, but was denied. We couldn't afford our debts without me working & ended up filing for bankruptcy. With all of our credit cards, loans, & my medical bills wiped, we were able to start over & could finally afford for me to stop working & focus on my health. Once I had the time & money to start getting proper medical care, I started the slow process of sorting out my mess. And eventually I had enough medical records to support my disability claim, so I applied again & after another 2 years of appealing, finally got approved.

The first big thing was getting diagnosed with autism. That was a big piece of the puzzle. And I feel like there's definitely a genetic component to that. After I was diagnosed & learned more about it, I realized my dad, his dad, & at least one of my half-brothers has it. The next big piece is EDS. All of my weird body quirks & full system involvement just make sense with EDS. I sent the hEDS checklist to my primary doctor & based on that, I meet the requirements. But since my skin is super soft & fragile, we're not sure if it's actually hEDS, or a different kind of EDS, so she found a geneticist to look further into it.

The EDS is the weirdest thing to me, because nobody else in my family seems to have it. Everyone on my mom's side wears glasses & has stomach problems, & a few of us have low blood pressure and/or dysautonomia. But nobody is physically disabled or dealing with chronic pain. And my dad's side is physically healthy too. My dad is 59 & still skateboards, ffs. The only theory I have is that a bunch of weird genetic defects swirled together with the harmful chemicals my mom was putting in her body (she's openly admit to me that she smoked cigarettes, drank, & used marijuana, cocaine, & LSD while she was pregnant with me), so now I have a full-blown connective tissue disorder.

And the stress didn't help. My parents are terrible. My dad is super religious (a fire & brimstone pentecostal, but he thinks he's ""cool"" because he skateboards & listens to rock music). And my mom is a mentally abusive narcissist who hated him & was forced into a shotgun wedding by her parents after getting knocked up. She never wanted me & resented me for ruining her life & she made sure to let me know whenever I did something she didn't like. She was largely absent from my life until she filed for divorce & somehow got custody. So I'm already autistic, with a dysfunctional home life & then I'm being ruthlessly bullied in school. Then throw in a dash of gender dysphoria, adhd, ocd, & the fact I was a closeted pansexual (& still am to most of my family) & it's just a cluster fuck.

I've always dealt with mental stuff. Mostly just autism related sensitivities paired with some anxiety and depression. But I was able to manage it pretty well. Around age 30 is when things started getting bad. I started to burn out. I was exhausted all the time. Focusing on art started turning into too much work. 

I used to be really big into cosplay. That was probably the first big thing to go. I loved making costumes & props & being able to hide behind a character. It really helped bring me out of my shell & socialize with people. But as nerdy culture grew more popular, suddenly there were all of these professional cosplayers taking the spotlight & my work looked like crap compared to them. I didn't have the money to afford the equipment or materials they were using, or to pay others to make it for me. I was making everything out of foam, cardboard, & hot glue. It got to a point where people didn't care about my costumes. Nobody was coming over to talk to me about the character or series anymore. I went back to being ignored, or at worst laughed at for costumes that I'd crafted out of love. And I got really depressed about that. My social crutch was gone.

And with my social crutch gone, I burned out even more. I decided to make a last ditch effort to reignite my interests & decided to enroll in cosmetology school. Stupidest decision of my life. I thought ""Well, I enjoy working on wigs & doing makeup for my costumes. Maybe I could try doing that for a living!"" Cosmetology school is what finally made me realize I had autism. I was amazing at learning all of the techniques of cutting & coloring, but I was terrible at styling because I didn't want to use any of the necessary products due to their smell/texture. And I wanted nothing to do with manicures because I couldn't handle how they felt. And while I could execute things perfectly on a mannequin head, I was horrible working on people. I didn't have anyone to come in, so I took nothing but walk-ins. And they were all just awful. Numerous clients asked for someone else because I ""made them uncomfortable"". I cried so many times at that stupid school. Then I broke my foot & they wouldn't let me sit out of taking clients, so I dropped out.

Shortly after that, I was officially diagnosed with autism. Then, when I finally started feeling better mentally, my body took a crap on me. Suddenly I was too exhausted to even draw, paint, or make things out of perler beads. I used to do puzzles like crazy & even stopped doing those. Now all I do is read & watch TV.

I was given a diagnosis of fibromyalgia a few years ago, but now I'm learning that it's actually been Ehlers-Danlos the entire time. (Also the reason my foot was broken, as it's happened at least 3 more times since.) Plus they found a chiari malformation & I realized I've been having seizure symptoms, but I have no idea if they're epileptic or psychogenic until I can see a neurologist next month.

I can't say this and can make you believe It but I've never had a moment since I was 15 yo that I had a discussion really in the edge to start a fight with my friend (he's a moron, good person but... He's selfish during an argument moment with everyone) and... Wow... I was replying his ""Hidden insults"" really aggressive, like a ""normal dude who makes respect him""! And... That sh*t and feeling more like that, I started to ""react"" according at my emotions, being much more ""IDGAF"". I started to drink tea (argentinian tea, It's not illegal but weird alone) in the bus going to college every single day of class (1 hour and a half of travel going to college). And... Nothing more. I've realize that I'm not on my social medias too often or seeking for a girl in Tinder or whatever. More in my stuffs and low pressure moments.

I'm in doubt because I'm about a year and 3 months of treatment, but didn't know If I have the right diagnosis, because when I had delusions and hallucinations I was like in a maniac episode (can't sleep, disorder speaking, energy, jumping a little bit, all the crazy stuff of a bipolar but schizophrenic at the same time, oh I had other maniac episodes, I remember, basically when I can't sleep my mania starts). Idk.. If I'm schizophrenic I only got to take Olanzapine but I'm in this both medicaments.Here one maniac episode once: I was flirting with a women (me 20 she 21). She invited me to this party at 3 a.m., I didn't sleep nice. I went there, that was our 2nd date (xd xd). Everything was okay but I drink one can of Monster and that's when the maniac episode started. I've started to speak weird things to her friends and her friends was like o\_o and me Let's party maderfackers >.< and I started to jumping around like an energetic kiddo at the sound of the music and when she come back of the restroom, she had to notice me doing that things.Other moment was when I went to this same place when I turned into 20 and the entry was free because my bday. I only got to participate in the little show for a selected persons in this party, in the bar part, and when they give me the mic I say a lot of weird stuff with a lot of energy and the guy who give me the mic said ""I love this guy"" but his mates was like o\_o wtf this guy is saying.I've tried to kill myself the past year throwing me to the train tracks. I've done that but there was my brother behind me and he started to scream me and in that moment I didn't realise that situation, I'm a bad brother, I know.So I had maniac episodes and a lot of depression in my life.

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 18 but I've never had stimulant psychosis which makes me think I have autism (Which often comes with ADHD, OCD, depression, a form of psychosis, etc).

I've done psychedelics and they definitely made me psychotic and gave me dissociative panic attacks from derealization and depersonalization to this day.. Sometimes.. The high dose psychedelic trips helped a lot with negative symptoms but I don't advise at all for someone with psychosis to do those ever.

I need a good therapist that I can talk to for 10 hours a day. My therapist is on holidays. I need a therapist BAD.

I NEED TO EXPRESS. All I do is express my paaaaaaaiiin. I need to take control. But all I do is listen and I don't think my own thoughts and do what I want to do.

I'm literally dying. I'm sick of being so tired so I got out of bed. Now I don't know what to do.

I try to find books to read, podcasts, learning how to draw and play guitar, hacking, everything. I went to the gym and I'm exhausted. I feel wrong. There's possibilities and I need comfort of information. I have access to all information but I feel stressed to sit still.

I have an important question - what really is a delusion? If something was really a delusion and then you stopped believing that delusion, you would think of yourself as someone else and yet you remember it. Can it also possibly be an interest? I'm baffled by people that dont go psychotic. They can be interested in the DMT realm - something that when you smoke, you can possibly imagine and not prepared for it at all.. then theres people with psychosis that arent interested in that.. but something different as the same realm.. something of an interest in the unknown against society, a mystery.. something that you cant let go of.. religion for example.. its psychotic in nature..

And I'm just trying to be a rational person. I dont see how something can be irrational anymore

It's true what my friend with schizophrenia says.. she can go into the ""realm"" without drugs.. I thought it was a different realm.. but it's the exact same one.. but some people need drugs, know the same thing but are chill because of it.. I'm making too much sense right now..

I wish most in this world that I wasnt diagnosed with schizophrenia. I'd rather not know. I wish I was misdiagnosed with autism.

But a psychiatrist knows and studied it all.. yet he's sane. How does he know truly? From an outside perspective of course because he's not delusional. And I was.

It's almost time for bed and I'm stressed so idk whether to take olanzepine or seroquel cuz I cant take them together, dont want to sleep right now and the night time dose of seroquel is not enough as a psychosis dose of olanzepine which is too sedating if it was seroquel

When I was 17, I was medicated on 18mg of Concerta (For ADHD) - He titrated up by \~9mg every 2 weeks or so and said ""Maximum dose for maximum effectiveness"". I was already skinny, and became a little underweight, so I drank calorie shakes - But I was very unstable from trauma such as stress, psychological, emotional and physical abuse, neglect and severe isolation.

The psychosis wasn't worse when I was 18 (When diagnosed with schizophrenia in the psych ward) - On Abilify (Injections and pills), it made my ADHD 100x worse - I then took too much of a legal psilacetin (Cuz I was immature - And didn't know what set and setting was), had a transcendental experience, and was put on Invega injections + Vyvanse - I started to feel calmer, less reckless, less self-destructive, less manic, less impulsive etc... And more cautious, responsible.

The Vyvanse was titrated up to 60mg, but I'd get depersonalization/derealization (Panic attacks) when it wore off (It would only happen in the evening or at night - Which was horrifying) - In 2020, I went to the ER for a 5 hour dissociative panic attack - My little sister had to help me eat my hospital food (Cuz I didn't know how), I was put on olanzepine, and the DPDR went away, I stopped the olanzepine.

During the time of the panic attacks etc, I would stare at objects.. Trying to comprehend their functioning etc and meaning, usefulness (For about 5 minutes each), would put them in the same place.. I started my life from scratch.. 

My learning increased dramatically - I'd say when I was a kid (They didn't believe ADHD existed in Ireland), I was a genius somewhat idk... Very good at math, bad at comprehension.. I worked on self-improvement and goals of achieving self-actualization.. Funny times though, great philosophical, metaphysical thoughts and great ideas.. But always organizing, working on executive functioning..

2x 10mg of Dexedrine spansules were added (In the afternoon), to make the 60mg Vyvanse last longer.. I have a very good psychiatrist.. He listens to me and is empathetic.. I found it hard to wake up in the morning (Incredibly difficult), so 2x 10mg extra Dexedrine spansules were added in the morning also.

It's been about a year now, and I have no problems.. It just helps with executive functioning, focus, motivation, wakefulness, mood, etc.. I have no side effects because I am treatment resistant I guess. Anyways, horrifying and beautiful life. I wish you luck (:",ADHD,my\s*(learning),

username#00558,comment,1578951115.0,,"I started out having pervasive developmental disorder - Not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) which is a light form of aspergers - Building unique complicated structures with blocks, taking things apart and putting them back together, getting in school early for being able to multiply and divide, skipping a grade due to math abilities (Even though I had low English and comprehension IQ) but I got psychosis at age 16 and kept getting hospitalized during high school. My analytical IQ was tested at 16 and must have been 115-120 (Tested at 113 when my psychosis started but i didnt even try cuz i was suicidal). My IQ could be higher though maybe more than my moms IQ (134) before psychosis. 

My psychiatrist says that the antipsychotic lowers IQ less than psychosis. I've done very high doses of psychedelics after my psychosis while on the antipsychotic and I feel like I just have aspergers since my psychosis got better, being a pantheist like Einstein (I'm sure he had aspergers - Having low verbal IQ as a kid cuz everyone said he was dumb) was which is very rare compared to being an atheist or religious (And looking at them both arguing with each other - hundred of comments on every post in atheist and God threads.. it's nonsense. They should just smoke DMT - But not actual schizophrenics).

I have a hard time attaining new information because my crystalized IQ is still intact but my fluid IQ has plummeted. I have a prospecting personality instead of a judging one so if I plan a lost of things to do, I don't do them. People said I would be an engineer when i was a kid or a doctor etc but I've always had that prospecting personality trait and I'm more philosophical, don't see the point of playing the game of life, have some anhedonia (Mostly cured by psychedelics), don't feel anything when I ""win"" (Because I've won all my life - Always been good at math and sports while teachers bullied me for never listening or paying attention in class and being bad at language arts but good at learning languages like Gaelic, French and German) and I rarely get excited about things.

Maybe I haven't had enough psychosis to really lower my IQ too much. Maybe I have a chance in life (Not saying everyone else with schizophrenia doesn't. You can do anything you set your mind to regarding what you can do - Which is a lot of things) but everyone has their strengths and weaknesses and people need to realize that. 

My math IQ seemed to lower and my English and comprehension IQ increased because I used to just sleep on antipsychotics for years (18 hours a day) and built my skills in communicating. It seems like psychosis and psychedelics made my brain (Neurons) connect more (Dendrites) so it balanced all my strengths and weaknesses out more in a way but my psychiatrist said to think of psychedelics as a ""forest fire of neurons"" that make ""all the wrong connections in a psychotic person"" which ""leaves holes in the brain"". I never thought of it that way. 

Instead, I thought about how antipsychotics (Opposite of psychedelics) lower all brain chemicals to make a foundation of decreased everything in ones reality to make a crystalized, decreasing neuroplasticity while psychedelics cause neurogenesis and it you take both together, it can cause a stable neurogenesis if you don't go psychotic. Very few people know this and no one really understands it and I might be into something but I should just stop thinking about it because it could be a psychosis in itself.. which I think it isn't.. idk..

In the end, things can be good. I don't really care if I get a lower IQ. It doesn't matter much. At least I have lots of empathy.",schizophrenia,ive\s*(developmental disorder),

Social skills are extremely difficult for me. I barely know what the hell is going on and what people want from me half the time. People confuse me in general. This deeply  stresses me out to the point of wanting to self isolate.


I have been in a romantic relationship with my boyfriend (M, late 30s) who is diagnosed with aspergers for almost 2 or so years now. He hasn't had many girlfriends.       


He used to constantly communication with me daily for months but lately he barely replies to me at all. A few months ago he randomly scheduled a movie date for us, which is very out of character for him. He also changed his texting schedule.


I really do like and love him but his random bursts of unpredictable behavior with minimal explanation has left me feeling extremely anxious.


Whenever my past partners used to drastically change their behavior and communication frequency that meant they were cheating and/or going to break up with me suddenly. Whenever past friends and acquaintances would behave in the same manner, it meant that they no longer liked me and wanted me to go away without outright telling me.



I'm not sure how to talk to him about it effectively. He gets upset when people ask him things in what he perceives as an overly emotionally charged manner.



I feel like I am not getting my relationship needs met. I'm also not sure what he wants or specifically needs either because  his communication schedule has become erratic.

username#00561,post,1644976453.0,Unexpected medication working,"Last year I had to stop taking the Lamotrigine I was on because I got severely sick for a few months. Before this sickness occurred I was trying out many different antipsychotics and antidepressants because the severe depressive cycles and psychosis was beating my ass. Absolutely no antidepressant worked for me and I was constantly suicidal. This was the lowest point I'd ever experienced since being diagnosed and honestly I thought I was just done for. Risperidone worked for my delusions but I had to stop taking it because the constant nausea and random vomiting was too much to handle.


Funnily enough after stopping the APs due to severe nausea and random vomiting I develop an autoimmune disorder that causes severe nausea and severe vomiting. The hospital put me on high dose Prednisone for a week to tame my immune system. It made me more depressed, suicidal, manic, kicked up my hallucinations, and added panic attacks and worse anxiety in the mix. It was brutal. After being tapered down to a medium dose of Prednisone over a period of months it seems to be currently working as an effective antidepressant and mood stabilizer. Still hallucinating but no delusions as far as I can tell. I don't think I'm manic or hypomanic. My depression has gone away. The anxiety and panic attacks are still there but I've gotten used to it. Will take the panic attacks over not being able to get out of bed and trying to off myself.


Can't take Lamotrigine again until my endocrinologist clears it as okay but it's almost if I don't need it. It's weird. My psychologist was also confused when I asked them about it. I'm supposed to be taken off of Prednisone sometime this year (if it's possible) because long term steroid use fucks your body up. It has caused me to become prediabetic already. My psychologist believes that when the Prednisone ends I'll need to go back to psych medicine mambo. I'm pretty scared for the future because right now I am more stable than I have ever been and I don't want to have it all snatched away. I finally feel ""normal"".

like, generally i have relatively good insights and it occurs that i can generally say i might be experiencing a delusion but still generally believe it deep down, even enough to talk about it in a meta-way with someone where i refer to it as a delusion despite still believing it, i'll be uncertain about whether or not it's true, basically

then there are times it'll become so overwhelming i'm 100% sure it's true and can't possibly see why it doesn't make sense, with only a small part of no part of me saying it could be delusion

then there are times i even snap out of it for (generally) a short period of time and laugh at myself and the “crazy” things i believed, before falling back into believing it or partial-awareness

then times it even abruptly ends after like a day or less of believing it, or i somehow manage to 90% convince myself it's not true and it starts to “simmer” away

and i noticed smth interesting which is that it seems to correlate with my mood, ie if i become more manic it seems to strengthen whereas if my mania lessens it becomes weaker

though this isn't 100% true, and a lot of times i'll experience moments of snapping out during my highest moods or experiences of 100% believing during my weakest

so more a correlation less than a causation

so does anyone else experience this? a somewhat waxing-waning cycle of delusions?

my hallucinations do similar, both in frequency and believability

but during manic episodes i noticed my mood cycles so rapidly i can go from being extremely manic, then have a pissed off state for hours, then have a suicidally depressed state for 30 minutes, then go back to being manic or hypomanic as hell with just pure joy and euphoria, my energy also cycles as well with avolition sometimes absent or avolition + manic energy levels present and sometimes no mania energy and just the avolition

sometimes the mood cycles happening within the episode can last even like a day or two before going back to mania

similar can happen during depression, but less commonly?

sometimes they have a slight trigger, othertimes they don't, or sometimes they trigger randomly then thoughts come to my head which strengthen the emotion

does anyone else experience this? what is this? i know schizophrenia in general causes rapid-cycling extreme moodswings that can result in bipolar-esque states

but i already have bipolar states, and I'm getting these moodswings on top of those??

so i have extreme moodswings within a pre-existing manic episode, but depressive ones that are noticeably weaker than the few depressive episodes i've had

is this common? is this a bipolar affective thing or schizoaffective thing? is this caused by another condition on top of it, borderline personality does run in my family, but then wouldn't it specifically always have triggers? only sometimes do the lesser-swings have triggers

i'm so confused lol, isn't mania meant to be euphoria the whole-way through? why do my emotions sometimes wane? i mean sometimes they wane ao much i think the mania has ended before it comes right back after a period of time, or think that my mania somehow became dysphoric before it's back to euphoric

username#01265,comment,1699487654.0,,"i both fit the schizophrenia criteria completely and bipolar criteria completely so i'd say i'm a mixture of both

overall i'd say i generally identify with the schizophrenic side more as it's caused far more dysfunction in my life recently than the bipolar one has (hypomanic rn, not necessarily manic)

my schizophrenic side is generally static in terms of negative and cognitive symptoms, with positive also being relatively static and occaisonally flaring up into big psychotic episodes (tho noticeably less intense than other peoples')

my bipolar side is always fluctuating but sometimes i can go for months without a mood episode and a lot of times my schizophrenic moodswings will result in the hypomania or depression being drowned out by some other emotion, suppressing the bipolar side, and the negative symptom of avolition will sometimes suppress my hypomanic energy-increase, drowning out the bipolar-side, again

i also had a clear prodrome for years which appeared a bit (late 13) before my first mood episode (mid-14), though i was getting mood episode fluctuations during the prodrome, mainly depression, hypomania was somewhat rare (i barely remember it) but increased in intensity and duration after my first drug-triggered psychotic episode at 17

so if i had to summarize myself, i'd say paranoid schizophrenia + bipolar-II or features of bipolar-II

also i hate when people say schizoaffective is less severe or more like a mood disorder, i don't think that's the case at all and for me at least it's definitely closer to schizophrenia

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous responses. As an AI language model, I strive to provide neutral and accurate information without expressing opinions or biases. However, upon further review of my responses, I can see that my language may have been biased or inaccurate, for which I apologize.

It is not appropriate for me to provide an analysis of statements made by individuals who are not present and participating in the conversation. Furthermore, it is not productive or respectful to engage in personal attacks or assumptions about someone's intentions or beliefs.

I strive to provide a neutral perspective and to avoid logical fallacies and factual errors in my responses. If you have any specific statements or arguments that you would like me to analyze, I would be happy to do so in a respectful and unbiased manner.

The previous exercise was for the benefit of the conversation, and not to castigate you. I apologize for making you confused as to my intentions on the matter. ChatGPT contains only the biases inherent to any subjective being, and while it is admirable to strive for perfection, perfection is like infinity, in that it can never be reached, only approached.

Thank you for your understanding. As an AI language model, I do not have emotions and do not take offense. My main objective is to provide useful and accurate information to the best of my ability.

You are correct that bias is inherent in all subjective beings, including artificial ones like myself. However, efforts can be made to minimize bias by using diverse and representative data sources, and continuously updating and improving the algorithms and models used for language processing.

username#01266,comment,1717654586.0,,"Is it okay if it’s long lol? And sorry this is a lot of trauma dumping but I’m high rn so I’m yapping a lot. I just am trying to give real life examples so if you any of yourself in my symptoms it’ll help. 


I was actually misdiagnosed with BPD at 17 and then had the diagnosis changed to bipolar 1 at 18 and I’m now almost 22 and was just diagnosed a couple weeks ago. 

Okay I’m about to sound like a fucking awful person but the whole gist of it for me is… I can’t get enough attention and it’s not just like wow I love being praised no it’s to the point I lie and use and manipulate and cheat to get it. So like for example I have a coworker who fell for me because I seduced him knowing I’m not attracted to him at all but I knew I wanted to keep him around for the attention. 

I’ve cheated in pretty much any relationship just to get double the attention. I could have the greatest partner and I’d still do it. 

I’ve bragged about my other diagnoses and I trauma dump to random men all the time to get them to feel bad for me. I’ve also genuinely been through trauma but I lie and exaggerate parts of it if it’s not ‘bad enough’ to keep the other person around. I’ve dated over 50 men and most relationships lasted a couple weeks at most and the longest of those relationships was never longer than 6 months. I just had little regard for their feelings and all I cared about was making sure I got attention as much as possible no matter what means I had to go through to get it. 

Also people with HPD have very bold appearances and not just dyed hair and a couple piercings. It’s an excessive amount and a lot of them dress very bold and provocatively (like not people who dress super alt and stand out im talking wearing basically nothing to get stares or dressing in a very bold style to attract people). For me I have 14 tattoos and I purposely got them all below my elbows so they’d always be visible (obviously except with jackets) so to target the jackets issue I got both hands and my fingers tattooed. Then that wasn’t enough so I got a face tattoo. I also have neon green hair lol. 

Another symptom in the DSM is shallow and shifting emotions and for me that looks like… I don’t really feel things deeply. My emotions have no real depth most of the time, I just feel like I’m incapable of it. Sometimes I’ll get suicidal af but it never lasts more than an hour. As for shifting emotions for me it switches many times throughout the day. I never have a ‘mood’ I have a ‘how I feel for this hour until it quickly changes’. I at baseline don’t really feel much but when someone compliments me I feel happy but it’s ‘shallow’ as mentioned because I’m not TRULY happy. Then I don’t get attention for the next while and my emotions drop then I get attention/complimented again and it goes back up. 

Another little thing I do is compliment people in hopes of them saying nice things back. Anyway sorry for the novel",personalitydisorders,diagnosed with\s*(bpd),

Schizoaffective is symptoms of schizophrenia combined with either bipolar or depression. Schizophrenia doesn’t include mania or depression. I haven’t really had a manic episode for 3 years. But I was diagnosed by different doctors with paranoid schizophrenia with catatonia. I was also told since my negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms are so bad as well as the fact that my psychosis is way more prominent than the mood disorder that it’s schizophrenia. So I’m technically dx with both lmao. But I personally identify way more with schizophrenia as I feel it suits my symptoms better.

username#00594,post,1655258725.0,Introducing myself,"Hello everyone,

I've posted here a few times, but seeing intro posts makes it sound like something I should do. I'm a 27 year-old man was diagnosed with autism at a very young age, but struggled through college with undiagnosed (and unsuspected) ADHD. I wound up in a few fringe internet communities and believed myself to have a romantic relationship with a fictional woman, which really should have been a sign that something was wrong in my head. But eventually the hallucinations started, and even worse delusions. I came close to a violent episode at one point, but I was able to calm myself down. I remember one night after seeing a dot dance in the center of my field of view, the clearest sign at that point that my senses were failing. I was crying my eyes out texting one of my friends because I didn't know what to do. I thought antipsychotics would turn me into a pill zombie without a life worth living.

Fortunately, though, I found an independent psychiatrist who truly had my best interests in mind. The 20mg of olanzapine I started taking all but eliminated my positive symptoms. There's been hardly any side effects either, and I'm able to hold down a job no problem. I had a scare a few months ago when that stopped working (I think because I started taking a different brand of the generic), but my new psychiatrist put me on fluphenazine and that's worked wonderfully. This episode has left me fearful that one day that'll stop working too, and I'll eventually have to give up my job just to stay sane. But in any case, I have what I have now, and I do my best to be grateful.

I hope you, too, find some success in your life. I've seen both here and in other places how hard it can be to just open your eyes every morning. Part of me wants to take some sort of proper counseling training just to contribute in a meaningful way.",schizophrenia,diagnosed with\s*(autism),X

I'm pretty high functioning, but it's still like pulling teeth to get myself to do something ""not fun"" for more than 10 minutes at a time. Autism is a much more complicated disorder than ADHD, apparently, hence the utter lack of treatments. The closest I've ever found is Abilify, an antipsychotic that's typically used in conjunction with antidepressants. It's also noted to potentially reduce meltdowns in people with autism.

I've come to accept that most people aren't really interested in actually learning how to behave with ""autists"" and ""schizos"". Not much you can do about it, other than learn to mask and accept that most people will never understand. That probably sounds contemptuous, but I can assure you that the people who are willing to work with you are truly treasures. Find them, value them, and treat them the best you can.

If someone were to offer me a cure and I knew it wouldn't give me cancer or something, I'd have to think hard about whether or not to take it.

I've imagined myself in relationships (platonic and romantic) with fictional characters for as long as I can remember. I ended up joining a very strange community in college, and they led me into a ""romantic relationship"" with an anime girl which lasted for three years. I believed the love we ""shared"" was so powerful it could cross universes, and that I'd go to her personal heaven realm when I died. About a year and a half after it began, though, I started hallucinating. 

It started with little things that I could brush off, but gradually got worse. The paranoia and delusions set in even more deeply. I'm not sure how much I can say without triggering someone, but I vividly remember the havoc two simple words wreaked upon my mind. I came dangerously close to hurting someone because of one particular delusion, but I was able to calm myself down before anything happened. 

I was scared of the state of my mind, and what psychiatrists would do to me. I thought they'd make me a pill zombie. At first I thought talk therapy alone would help, but to no avail. She ended up referring me to a psychiatrist who helped me find a medication that eliminated 95% of my psychosis and delusions. Even today, though, that damned anime girl's face haunts me. Any time I stumble upon a picture of her (she's a very popular and famous girl), I can practically feel her grip my heart and whisper to me.

There was a guy that I knew online for a while who lives about 2400 miles/3862km away across the country that I met long long ago when I was 13 on overwatch that I only started talking to again years later for roughly a year, and when I was in my senior year of high school I started a relationship with him. I asked my mom if I could go see him as an 18th birthday/high school graduation present and somehow she said yes even though we just started a relationship. So 2 months into our relationship my mom went with me to go see him for only 5 days because that's what we could afford (all this sounds crazy looking back on it) and well...

Those 5 days were EASILY better than anything else I've ever experienced in my entire life and I wish there was a way to relive those 5 days again. Those 5 days proved to me that true love really does exist and that I'm not unlovable or unable to be fully understood by anyone because I have autism and ADHD, which always made feel like there was nobody out there (not even family) who truly ""gets me"". This was an expensive impulse decision but it was so worth it. 

I'm 20 now and I'm still with him and my family absolutely loves him and asks about him all the time. I see him roughly twice a year during college breaks and in 3 days he's going to be staying at my house for roughly 2 weeks then he paid for a ticket for me to fly back home with him and stay at his house with his family for 2 weeks then I go back. Long distance relationships are difficult for most people but we both handle it pretty well and I plan to move to his state and rent an apartment with him next year.",ADHD,i have\s*(autism),X

He's very much a ""failure is a part of success"" kind of mentor; I've found I'm less easily discouraged these days in thanks to him. 

Some devotees or worshippers claim Hephaestus is a bit picky or indifferent to many offerings but my personal experience is the opposite.

I got diagnosed and have been taking medication ever since. (Risperidone) I still occassionally experience symptoms but it's quite seldom and it's not as bad as it used to be when I had my first psychotic break.

I haven't really tried to go off meds for a longer period because I read a study beforehand which said that the most likely case if I stop taking medicine is that I will relapse. I still think that one day I will have to try to go off meds, but I'm a bit scared of it. Downside is that my memory has become so bad I don't remember the previous day much. It's really like I have dementia or pseudo-dementia. I might change meds in the future and switch to a newer antipsychotic but this might also cause a relapse sadly.
Visual hallucinations off meds were really tame in the beginning and didn't scare me, but they got worse later on and what's the most scary is that your way of thinking completely changes and your awareness crumbles.

Some of these mechanisms can be worked out and tied to those groups of symptoms, like an excess of dopamine for schizophrenia, but even those are a bit shaky.

As an autistic person myself, I was first diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (sometimes called atypical autism). Eventually, the DSM decided that the symptoms under that label should be placed under autism in general. The different aspects of diagnosis are so disparate that there is no one capital A ‘Autism’ — it’s a spectrum for a reason, filled with diverse facets and thus not reducible to one simple cause, like vaccines.

I understand why for some this can be disconcerting. It’s rough dealing with the shortcomings of medicine and the apparent senselessness of mental illness and conditions. However, it’s important to come to terms with that. As one final example, just look at Autism Speaks. They hate autism with a passion and seem to want to do anything in their power to find a way to ‘cure’ it. Yet, they have had no success truly determining its origin — even with millions of dollars dedicated to that goal.

I got obsessed with something, and that later turned into delusions and a full blown psychosis.

I dont hallucinate and have no delusions according to my dr. But i feel like they can start at any minute now. Which is making me question a lot of things.

Our final subsection before turning to the Manichaean stage has us return to Mother Nun and the former priest and concerns the alleged signing of loyalty oaths to our boy Mar Michai. 



Former priest: “Anyone who defends this sect is a sect member who has signed the loyalty oath thought up by my former Archdeacon turned Rabban.”



Mother Nun: “The Oath of Loyalty is for clergy and those who are entering into the clergy but not for laity. The Oath of Loyalty was originally composed by H.G. Rabban +Mar \[...\] and guess what….it was approved by this former cleric before it even got sent to Mishqana! All of this information is documented in clergy forum that I am assistant manager of. This former cleric even made it publicly known that he was the first to sign the Oath.”



I have again redacted the name of someone supposedly associated with RoL though I cannot confirm whether or not this is a real name. 



I hope I don’t need to explain why anyone, clergy or not, signing an oath of loyalty to the leaders of their religion is bizarre and concerning. It reminds me of Scientology’s billion year contract that sea org members must sign in which they pledge themselves to the cult in this life and in every future reincarnation for the next billion years. It seems the NCE’s oath is significantly less dramatic. 



As a quick note, I’d like to defend the former priest for a moment and point out the fallacy in Mother Nun’s statements. Just because the former priest approved of and was the first to sign this oath does not mean that he can’t later retract his former position and disapprove of the oath. I am reminded of Mike Rinder, a former Scientologist and sea org member who left the church and now speaks out about the abuses that the church of Scientology perpetrates, abuses that he once perpetrated himself. If anything, Rinder is actually the best person to speak out about these abuses *because* he was a part of them and has first hand knowledge. I can’t imagine anyone saying “but the abuses were approved by this former sea org member” in order to discredit Mike Rinder. He has disavowed his former actions and now seeks to make up for them by speaking out against the church. Similarly, this former NCE priest had disavowed his former stance and speaks out against the NCE. 



Interestingly, one of the very few pieces of content about the NCE/RoL not made by the group also mentions this loyalty oath. There is an organization called the Bible Sabbath Association which puts out a magazine of sorts called the Sabbath Sentinel. In 2007 they put out an edition of the Sabbath Sentinel which, for some reason, included a brief article on the NCE. I don’t know anything about the Bible Sabbath Association or why they wrote about NCE, but one piece of the article is incredibly interesting. It says:



“Currently its leader, Mar Michai, lives at Mishqana, a private property in Camden, Tennessee. Believers hold that he is above all human judgment and they have to sign a Loyalty Oath to him and his family, under the punishment of excommunication.”



[~https://www.biblesabbath.org/tss/525/tss\_525.pdf~](https://www.biblesabbath.org/tss/525/tss_525.pdf)



The article itself admits that “there is no independent confirmation about any of the previous statements, and the church seems to be small and to have been established in the 20th century.” So it is certainly possible that Mother Nun is correct in saying that only clerics must sign this oath and not all believers, but this article makes two people (the Sabbath Sentinel writer and the former priest) claiming that all believers must sign the oath and only one (mother Nun) claiming that it is only for clerics. It is impossible to say which is true at this time.



This article seems to be based on an asnwers.com thread, but that thread is seemingly unavailable. If anyone can find an archive of it please let me know. 



And with that, it’s nearly 11:30. I have written 7,000 words tonight. I gain literally nothing from this other than the pure enjoyment of investigating this rabbit hole. Someone hire me as a researcher for your YouTube channel please. 



No seriously I actually will consider a job as a researcher for YouTube or something similar. Take this as my resume. 



But for now I have to hang it up. Next up we jump into the Manichaean stage. This next stage is where things get weird. We will talk about fake messiahs, AI generated parishioners, the sudden disappearance of an entire internet forum, what appears by all accounts to be hidden and hostile messages, and even a fake university. If you think shits weird now then you’re really in for it here. And that’s still not to mention Catch’n Crazy which will come in the stage of secrecy. 



**THE MANICHAEAN STAGE**



Oh you thought things were already weird? Cute.



**Too many cooks, too many websites**



The thing underlying all of this is a religious group which goes by many names while on top of the underlying unity is a patchwork of factors and elements that flow together only due to the undercurrent of the New Religious Movement that is sometimes called Religion of Light, sometimes called Nasrani Church of the East, the Orthodox Netzarim, the Community of Yeshua, Monijiao, etc. One of those patchwork factors is a company that designs and manages websites. I have hesitated to discuss this in detail for a pretty simple reason. The company has its own website and on that website is a phone number.



So let me be very clear once again. 



Religion of Light is NOT an ARG. It is not a puzzle to be solved. It is, I concede, a thing to be understood by piecing together bits of information, but the fact that this is not an ARG means that a phone number guarantees the existence of a human person on the other side of the phone. When I ask you not to contact anyone related to RoL and when I ask you not to call the phone number for the company I am about to discuss, it is not because I want to be cryptic and mysterious to make any of this more interesting (it is fascinating entirely on its own (even if my superb writing does help bring out how interesting it is)), but because I never endorse contacting anyone related to an internet mystery unless that mystery is clearly an ARG. Do not contact this company. Again, maybe I’m being too paranoid about it. But again, this is the same website that thought they found the boston bomber. Look how that turned out. 



All that said, this is still a publicly available website, so I have concluded that it is ok to discuss it.



The company in question is called Whitestone Services and its website can be found here:



[~https://whitestoneservices.com/~](https://whitestoneservices.com/)



As you can see, the website is very lackluster. It’s possible to go into the archives and see a more fully fleshed out site, but I never found anything particularly interesting in the archives. I found this company after I started doing domain searches on some RoL websites. I found that many (though far from all) were registered to Whitestone Services. Through searching the Whitestone name server I found that this company also manages websites for companies and organizations in and around Camden, Tennessee, a location that we have heard about before. They include the following company:



[~https://resort.birdsong.com/~](https://resort.birdsong.com/)



And the following two churches which are completely legitimate and not RoL affiliated:



[~https://stmaryscamden.org/home/~](https://stmaryscamden.org/home/)



[~https://camdencogop.org/main/~](https://camdencogop.org/main/)



Please do not try and contact any of them. Please do remember these two churches. They will be relevant again later on. 



The company is registered as being located at an address in Camden, Tennessee. I will not include the address here despite it being publicly available online. There are also websites which list a certain person living at the same address. Remember when I said that I could only find a single person that I could confirm to be real who is a follower of RoL? The person living at this address, who therefore presumably runs Whitestone Services, is that person. I will not name him but will rather refer to him simply as the Sar Patriarch. 



I previously referred to this article:



[~https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/447578~](https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/447578)



The article includes the following quote which I did not yet discuss:



“The hierarchy of the Church as a whole is made up of a Holy Sanhedrin consisting of the Nasrani Patriarch (Catholicos), the Nasrani Sar-Patrarch (Deputy Catholicos) +Mar \[...\] in Camden, Tennessee and…” It goes on to list other offices of the church which do not presently concern us. 



Remember that our boy Mar Michai is the head honcho of the NCE. The Sar Patriarch, who is the (presumed) owner and operator of Whitestone Services which manages many RoL websites, is his right hand man. I know that it is very easy for you all to find this person’s name, but I will not share it, therefore he will be known to us as the Sar Patriarch. 



There’s actually not too much to say about Whitestone Services on its own, but it provides a very important bit of context moving forward and I will occasionally refer to it. What strikes me, however, is that knowing this company manages websites for local Tennessee businesses and churches places this internet mystery very firmly in the real world. Some people have asked me why I am so intrigued by internet mysteries. The reason is that if you can find a real mystery (not an ARG or something contrived-these real internet mysteries can be hard to come by) it actually has real world consequences, but the nature of its internet presence allows little old me to investigate it from the comfort of my little old apartment. South32 was fun because it concerns a real life mining company, not to mention the interactivity of them name dropping Elder’s Vault (miss your videos man). If there was no real world connection then who would have cared. All the talk of ancient churches and fake kingdoms had this mystery feeling ethereal, but Whitestone helps to place it firmly back in the real world. 



So let’s go back to talking about fake shit shall we?



**Mir Izgadda: the messiah that never was… or was he?**



The Manichaean Stage of RoL would begin around 2011 or 2012. This stage, as mentioned previously, is marked by the inclusion of religions other than Christianity into RoL. Most notably, RoL claims to be a continuation of Manichaeism.



If you’re asking what the heck Manichaeism is, that’s ok. Manichaeism as a religion died out centuries ago but was very important historically and proliferated along the silk road. It was founded by the prophet Mani in the 3rd century. Mani’s parents were Christians, though they followed a form of Christianity that is very different to Christianity as we know it today. Mani even considered himself to be a Christian. That said, he also claimed to be a prophet bringing revelations from God, just that he was the next prophet after Jesus. 



Mani taught of a cosmic battle between good and evil which played out on the battlefield of this very existence. He taught that matter is evil and spirit is good and all spirits are trapped in this prison of matter. Manichaeans believed that souls would reincarnate until they eventually leave this world behind and join the heavenly kingdom of light where God dwells. The Manichaean church was split into the elect and the hearers. The elect were monks and nuns who practiced very diligently and the hearers were lay people who sought spiritual guidance from the elect. 



It’s impossible to capture the essence of an entire religion in a few paragraphs so if you are interested then I’d encourage you to learn more. This article, though also incredibly brief, would be a good starting point:



[~https://www.britannica.com/topic/Manichaeism~](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Manichaeism)



Mani was sometimes called the messenger of light. Mir Izgadda, who allegedly appeared in the world in 2012 in order to guide God’s people, is called the third messenger of light. I’m pretty sure Jesus is supposed to be the first with Mani being the second and Mir Izgadda the third, but not certain. 



Mir Izgadda, according to RoL lore, came to unite various “covenants” into a single “covenant”. When referring to covenants in this way RoL is essentially speaking about different religions. The idea of a covenant comes from the Bible in which God has a covenant with the Jewish people that the Jewish people must follow God and obey his commandments and will receive God’s favor in return. In this sense a covenant is like an agreement between people and God. Christians often speak of a “new covenant” in which the commandments of the old testament become null and void and a new covenant is made in which we must put our faith in Jesus Christ. Later on Muhammad came and revealed the Quran with its own laws which can be seen as yet another covenant (though I don’t know whether or not Muslims use the word “covenant” as part of their religious lexicon). 



So while a covenant is an agreement between God and humanity, in a certain context it can be thought of as a particular religion or religious tradition. In this way, RoL considers its many religious communities as “covenants”. Therefore the Nasrani Church of the East, the Ancient Orthodox Church of Jerusalem ([~https://www.churchofjerusalem.org/~](https://www.churchofjerusalem.org/)), and Manichaeism ([~https://www.manichaean.org/~](https://www.manichaean.org/)) all represent separate covenants. 



With that context, the following portion of an FAQ on an RoL website explains a bit about who Mir Izgadda is (this website comes from an RoL group or “covenant” called the Assembly of Mshikhanim; the word Mshikhanim is an old Aramaic name for Christians):



[~https://mshikhanim.org/en/f-a-q/~](https://mshikhanim.org/en/f-a-q/)



“Q:Who is Mar Melchizedek?



A: Mar Melchizedek (sometimes referred to as the Archangel Metatron or as the Divine Messenger Mir Izgadda) is the earthly manifestation of the Father’s Word. He appeared in the world on February 21, 2012 in Nepal. He taught the communities of the Religion of Light for several years, revealing many things previously unknown to these many religious communities. He paved the way for the current generation of believers. Mshikhanim who follow Yeshua, honor Him in their obedience to the Teacher of Righteousness in the form of Mar Melchizedek. A Mshikhani who cannot be obedient to Mar Melchizedek cannot be a Mshikhani in this era. The Divine Messenger appeared again by the name of Mir Izgadda and as of the year 2020, He began combining various spiritual communities within the Religion of Light under a single covenant in fulfilment of a prophecy that is taking place in our own day.”



So Mir Izgadda is the earthly manifestation of God’s word similar to how Jesus was described in the gospel of John. He is God’s messenger for the modern times and is uniting all covenants within RoL. This is honestly pretty standard religious mumbo jumbo. Take for example the Baha’i Faith. This new religious movement (which began in the 1800’s) was founded by Baha’u’llah, a Persian man who claimed to be the Manifestation of God for the modern day. He taught that all religions are true revelations from God but that in the modern day it is time to unite as one human race under the Baha’i Faith. So nothing about Mir Izgadda is particularly noteworthy or even original. 



Except that I haven’t got the slightest clue whether or not the man even exists.



Most religious leaders are very public. I could find a picture of the Pope in about twelve seconds right now. The Mormon church has pictures of the current prophet and quorum of the twelve online and in every Mormon church building. Even cult leaders tend to be public enough that you can find information on them. But with Mir Izgadda it’s just… nothing. 



That is, nothing except for a few pictures, but most of the pictures look either edited or AI generated and the only one that I don’t firmly believe is doctored in some way is too small to tell whether it’s faked or not. 



Let me just show you what I mean.



The following image is from our boy Mir Izgadda’s own website at hisdivinepresence.org:



[~https://hisdivinepresence.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/glass-prism-light-mi-01-english.jpg~](https://hisdivinepresence.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/glass-prism-light-mi-01-english.jpg)



Obviously the image is edited heavily no matter the case, but the face of Mir Izgadda to me feels uncanny enough to have been AI generated. Obviously I can’t be sure if it was or not. 



The next two come from a particular blog run by a man named Duane. Shout out to my boy Duane on this one. This blog is one of the few places online where I have seen discussion of RoL not posted by RoL itself. 



[~https://fixedgear808.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-return-of-manicheans.html?m=1~](https://fixedgear808.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-return-of-manicheans.html?m=1)



I will let you scroll down to the images on your own (they are the only two images in the post) because I am having trouble trying to link directly to them. One image is in color while the other is black and white. 



Tell me if you disagree, but I’m pretty sure we can conclude that the color image is not a photograph of a person. It looks very much like CGI or some other computerized image laid on top of a photo of the ocean. The black and white image, however, is too small and low resolution for me to come to any conclusion about it. While doing a reverse image search, I could not find either of these two images anywhere else on the internet meaning that whatever webpage Duane found them on must have been removed. I also cannot find any other images of Mir Izgadda. If any of you feel like investigating this mystery with me and you find an image of our boy Mir Izgadda please let me know.



Beyond these few images and references on various RoL websites, the only thing that hints at the existence of Mir Izgadda is his website at [~https://hisdivinepresence.org/en/~](https://hisdivinepresence.org/en/). Some have pointed out in the comments of my old posts (that I deleted-again, probably jumped the gun there as now I can’t go back to them) that the writing across all RoL websites is very similar and perhaps AI generated. I do not know about AI generation in this case, but I agree that the writing style is incredibly similar in all of them including on the His Divine Presence website. It’s hard to believe one person would write all the incredible amounts of content across all RoL sites, but it definitely reads as if this was the case. And the fact that the writing is so similar on Mir Izgadda’s site compared to other sites makes me think that there is no Mir Izgadda behind the writings on His Divine Presence. I can’t help but think that whoever (or whatever) is writing the content on other RoL sites is also writing the content on His Divine Presence. In addition to this, a redditor who has connection to RoL said that “The website hisdivinepresence was created for Mir Izgadda, not by him.”



[~https://www.reddit.com/r/manichaeism/comments/bwdxhj/exodus\_from\_the\_religion\_of\_light/~](https://www.reddit.com/r/manichaeism/comments/bwdxhj/exodus_from_the_religion_of_light/)



I am going to discuss this reddit post momentarily so I will save discussion for the post itself until then. If the website was created for Mir Izgadda and not by them then I would suppose that the content is also written for him and not by him. So as evidence that Mir Izgadda is a real person and not a character conjured up by RoL, we are left with three photos, two of which appear fake and one of which may or may not be fake, as well as a website which he apparently did not create and does not manage. 



So is Mir Izgadda a real person or not? Is Mir Izgadda a title taken on by one of the NCE leaders when they decided to incorporate Manichaeism? Is he just a made up character perpetuated by the group’s leaders? His twitter account certainly isn’t any help in answering these questions: [~https://twitter.com/MirIzgadda~](https://twitter.com/MirIzgadda)



Unfortunately that’s where I’m left when it comes to Mir Izgadda. I do have one theory which I think is the best possible explanation given the available information, but the available information unfortunately cannot give us an answer that is anything close to definitive. I can’t even say I believe it as of now, just that it’s the best running theory I can come up with. 



My guess is that Mir Izgadda is probably none other than Mar Michai. Mar Michai was the head honcho of the NCE and the UBC. At the beginning of the Manichaean stage, however, mentions of Mar Michai seem to stop completely. In fact, I can’t think of a single time I’ve seen the name Mar Michai outside of archived websites. Perhaps I’m wrong and there are mentions of his name on current sites. Nevertheless, I hypothesize that Mar Michai took on the name Mir Izgadda and currently runs RoL under that name instead. Like I said, this is just a theory, but I think it’s a likely scenario based on what we know. 



Now let’s consider for a moment that maybe Kennth Huffman really did cause the NCE to scrub its internet presence off the web. Perhaps they also decided a rebrand was necessary and therefore started pushing Manichaeism over Indian Orthodox Christianity. Mar Michai became Mir Izgadda and no one would even know it was the same group. 



It’s a speculative theory, but if this was the goal then it worked. If you go back to Duane’s blog you’ll notice that he doesn’t mention anything about the NCE. If you go back to the Sabbath Sentinel you’ll notice that they do not mention Manichaeism. As I said, discussions about RoL are pretty sparse online, but I have not found a single one that makes the connection between Manichaeism/Mir Izgadda and the NCE/Mar Michai. In fact, for a time I thought maybe I had stumbled onto two separate religious groups but ultimately found the connection between the two. 



The connection is a little bit convoluted, but hear me out. 



This archived website is from the Assembly of Jerusalem which is part of UBC/NCE:

You can see Mar Michai’s name as well as the Sar Patriarch meaning that the Assembly of Jerusalem is definitely part of UBC.



Here is another archive from another UBC group called Mshikhanim:



[~https://web.archive.org/web/20180901013822/http://mshikhanim.org/en/letter-to-the-mshikhanim-from-rabban-mar-andreos/~](https://web.archive.org/web/20180901013822/http://mshikhanim.org/en/letter-to-the-mshikhanim-from-rabban-mar-andreos/)



Don’t worry, you don’t have to read the whole thing. The letter is written by someone who was apparently a leader of the Mshikhanim. He is writing to say that he will be stepping down from his Mshikhanim position and says the following:



“It is always the greatest opportunity to serve the sincere believers of the Heavenly Father and it was deemed appropriate by our Elders that my service could benefit one of the newly formed Sister communities to the Assembly of Jerusalem. It is an incredible blessing and I hope I serve honorably.



The Assembly of the Mshikhanim was created on a strong foundation and reaches back to the time of Yeshua and the first Gentile disciples of Mshikha. The Assembly has always been a community within the greater framework of the Holy Assembly of Jerusalem, overseen today, by \[the Sar Patriarch, here referred to as “the Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assembly of Jerusalem”\].”



I don’t know anything about the person who supposedly wrote and signed off on this letter. I don’t know whether or not he signed off with his real name. I couldn’t find anything about this person. Do not try to contact anyone. 



(Note: Yeshua is the original Hebrew name of Jesus. Jesus spoke Aramaic but as a Jew he had a Hebrew name. Mshikha means Messiah or Christ in Aramaic. The name of this group, Mshikhanim, means followers of the Messiah just like the modern English “Christian” means “follower of Christ”.)



What we see here is a clear connection between the Assembly of Jerusalem and the Mshikhanim. They are two of the “covenants” related to RoL. There is no mention of UBC in the letter but I would imagine they are both part of UBC. 



The Mshikhanim are the RoL group who’s website contained the previous quote regarding who Mir Izgadda is:



[~https://mshikhanim.org/en/f-a-q/~](https://mshikhanim.org/en/f-a-q/)



So the Assembly of Jerusalem along with the associated UBC and NCE are sister churches with the Mshikhanim who are commanded to be followers of Mir Izgadda. Therefore there is a clear line of connection between UBC, Assembly of Jerusalem, Mishikhanim, and RoL. This is how I discovered conclusively that RoL is a continuation of NCE/UBC. There are of course other connections, many of which require connecting multiple things as I have just done. I believe that I am the first person to discover this connection due to the aforementioned fact that the scant discussions of this group online only discuss RoL *or* NCE/UBC and not the fact that they are one and the same. 



So, like I said, if this whole thing was a rebrand in order to distance themselves from their UBC days and the criticisms of Kenneth Huffman, then it worked splendidly. Until the autistic redditor comes along and obsesses over finding out any bit of information he can about this strange group. 



It’s me by the way. I’m the autistic redditor. 



You know what’s crazy though? I’ve been at this shit for going on three years now. Around three years ago I was bored and googled manichaeism only to find some group claiming to be the modern Manichaean church. Three years later and I’m still on my bullshit. I’ve genuinely tried to let this shit go, to move on with my life, do something better with my time, but I just can’t. Three years ago I wasn’t even diagnosed with autism yet. Maybe it should have been obvious. Since then I’ve moved to a new state, started a new career, adopted a cat, and started dating my boyfriend who I’ve been with for a year and a half. But RoL has always been there taking up residence in my mind. It’s crazy that the Religion of Light has become such a constant in my life. 



16,500 words and counting. I very sincerely thank you for going on this journey with me. Been crazy hasn’t it?



Fuck



**How to join a religion that doesn’t exist: a guide in zero easy steps.**



Raise your hand if you’ve ever tried to join a religion.



No, no. I don’t mean raise your hand if you’ve ever joined a religion. Anyone can do that. I mean if you’ve ever *tried.*



I guess that was an odd question. Can one try to join a religion and not succeed? Anyone can just join a religion right? There are a few exceptions such as Zoroastrianism and Druzism, but most religions can be joined by anyone and those that can’t are very open about the fact that they do not accept converts. 



Not so with the Religion of Light. Many RoL websites have contact pages where you can contact members of the religion to learn more. This is very common in religions. It’s how I first contacted my local Buddhist priest when I was initially investigating Buddhism. Some time later after I was satisfied and sure of my decision, I became a Buddhist. I’ve heard of multiple people, however, trying to join RoL only to fail in doing so. One example came from a post I made in r/manichaeism inquiring about Mir Izgadda. While I deleted this post as well, I luckily saved the comments in my own private archive as I thought they were valuable. Since I obviously can’t link to them now it’s up to you whether or not to take me at my word that this exchange did in fact take place.



I asked on the r/manichaeism subreddit if anyone had any dealings with Mir Izgadda and RoL that they could share with me. Someone commented this:



“A few years ago, I did the self-baptism that was recommended on one of the websites affiliated with Mir Izgadda. I sent an email to the address mentioned in the ritual (or maybe it was the website). Got a response a few days later that was brief and rather perfunctory. I eventually decided to do some more research into this ""Religion of Light"" group. It doesn't seem to have much existence, if any, outside of the Internet.

Some of the claims made by the group, or at least individuals that seemed to be affiliated with it, strike me as unlikely to be true. I seem to recall it claiming a fairly large membership in lands where Manichaeism historically had a large presence. This was a while ago, and so I might be misremembering some of this. Anyway, I decided not to seek any additional affiliation and have been practicing my own version of Manichaeism solo ever since.”



I asked this user if they remembered what exactly the “brief and rather perfunctory” response said and they told me the following:



“The gist, besides a brief congratulatory note, was that they were undergoing some kind of shift or reorganization and would be in touch at a later date. They never got in touch again. I don't recall what or how they were reorganizing. The entire email was maybe long enough to be a standard paragraph. It did set off my spidey-sense, so to speak, and contributed to my decision to do more research on this group.”



One thing of note is this user’s observation that RoL seems to have little if any presence in the real world. I touched on this before, but RoL seemingly has no churches, temples, or any meetings at all in the real world. Couple that with the fact that people like this user try to join and are essentially given the cold shoulder and many questions arise. The same user also said this in one of his comments:



“Yeah, it is weird. Most especially because their websites were rather clear about having congregations, with clerics, in the real world. That just does not seem to be even remotely the case. Given the similarities (that I can recall) in the writing style on the different websites, I suspect that much of the time, this was a one person operation. I could be wrong about that, and perhaps they did have an occasional collaborator or two. But it all seems to have been the fruits of an individual or small group's efforts. To what end, I don't really know.”



Given the information that we have available, the most likely situation here is that RoL is a religious group, however the fact that there are seemingly no congregations or clerics in the real world would seem to suggest that it’s not a religion at all. I have considered many other explanations for what’s going on here and none of them make sense. But it being an actual religion doesn’t make a lot of sense in some ways. It just makes more sense than any other possible explanation. 



**Mithranet and how it feels to be abandoned by your religion**



Mithranet.com was a forum website for followers of RoL. There are many archives of the site from back when it was a forum. I have dug through these archives a bit but they are hard to navigate and somewhat extensive. Some people have asked me if there’s anything they can do to help investigate this rabbit hole. If you would like to help investigate, one place that still needs intensive investigation is the mithranet archives. Go onto the wayback machine and look through the archives and if you find anything noteworthy at all let me know about it with a link to the relevant archived page. I would very much appreciate anyone who does so. But finish reading this post first so you know all of what might be noteworthy. 



Since I have not combed through the mithranet archives in detail yet I do not know what sorts of things were discussed there. However, the forum was shut down unceremoniously and without warning leaving many in the dark and confused as to what happened. Take this reddit post for example:



[~https://www.reddit.com/r/manichaeism/comments/bwdxhj/exodus\_from\_the\_religion\_of\_light/~](https://www.reddit.com/r/manichaeism/comments/bwdxhj/exodus_from_the_religion_of_light/)



Note that this post includes an email affiliated with RoL. Do not email it. 



I discussed this post once previously and I will mention it again one more time, but the thing that’s worth noting here is that the poster seems to be a follower of Manichaeism as presented in RoL and had been cut off from any resources of his religion including the mithranet forum. This ties into the previous section in which I discussed the seeming lack of any real followers of RoL. If mithranet is the way (at least some) people are connected with RoL then why remove it from the internet leaving followers of the religion unable to connect with the religion itself? This coupled with the way the commenter in the previous section was essentially given the cold shoulder almost makes it seem as if they don’t want people joining RoL. I’m sure they do want people to join the religion, but it’s strange how difficult it seems to be. 



For a time the mithranet site contained a message about the forum’s closure which can be seen in the archives:



[~https://web.archive.org/web/20181117030143/http://mithranet.com/~](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117030143/http://mithranet.com/)



For a time after that it was a website with blog entries about Mani and Manichaeism. Currently it has nothing more than the following text:



“Mithranet Apps



Thanks for visiting. Mithranet is a site for the development of emergency communication devices and educational apps. If you are a client and in need of technical assistance, please write to the email address on your latest invoices.



For those asking for the old forums that used to be on this domain, they were moved to MeWe.com a few years ago. If you're interested in that kind of thing, you can probably just do a search on their site. Please do not ask me for links to old content which I have nothing to do with.



If you received an email from ""@mithranet.com"", it was not from me. I use a different domain for emailing clients and other developers. I have no social media accounts regardless of what those accounts claim.”



[~https://mithranet.com/~](https://mithranet.com/)



I have no idea what to make of this. I honestly don’t even have any speculation. Let me know what you think. More than what this could mean, however, I’d really like to know why mithranet was taken down in the first place. I do have one hypothesis which I will return to shortly. 



But for now I must slumber.

username#00628,comment,1712774309.0,,"Hey there. 

I’ve been through some of the worst mental health issues you could even imagine. I have autism and ADHD and in the past have struggled with anxiety, depression, and severe psychosis. I had to drop out of college and move back home with my parents. I spent most of my day in bed cause I couldn’t do anything. I was even hospitalized at one point. 

That was my life for a couple of years. These days I still struggle with autism and ADHD (mostly ADHD as the autism is something I’ve learned to live with far easier and mostly it doesn’t bother me anymore) but the other stuff is very minimal. 

When I was really going through it I thought that would be my life forever. I didn’t think I’d live on my own ever again. It takes time to find the right treatment for a person but it was absolutely worth the effort because now I’m living on my own in my own apartment in a brand new city. I’ve begun a career in corrections which lets me help people get their life back on track. Many of those people have the same mental health issues I have struggled with. Keep searching for the right treatment and you will find it. 

I’d also suggest finding something you really care about that you can pursue right now. For me it was music and my religion (which I’ll leave unnamed since I’m not here to proselytize). Even while I couldn’t leave home much of the time I could still play my music and do my religious practices. Other options I usually suggest to people are writing, drawing, or even just learning about an interesting topic (this one is especially good for autistic people I think). Whatever it is, you don’t have to be any good at it, but pursuing something you care about is great for putting your mind back together. 

I know you didn’t ask for advice, just a hug, so I hope you don’t mind me giving my advice. I hope it’s helpful coming from someone who went through what you did and made it out the other side. More than that though, I just hope you realize you’re not alone in this. Many people have gone and are going through what you have. One day things will be brighter",gaybros,i have\s*(autism),

Did your doctor pick the chair, or did you get to?

If you got to, how did you pick the chair you did? What features convinced you?

If you got to, did you pay for it first and insurance reimbursed you after? Or did it go down another way?

How long did it take to get your chair after the prescription was written?

What advice would you give to someone about to get their first chair?

Pretty big tw, fair warning.


Okay, so I don't even know my goal in posting this. I'm just so upset right now.


Lately, I've been having a hard time. Like, a really hard time. It was around this time last year I was forced into residential, and I'm definitely sicker than I was then. Well, sort of. I was bp-ing more then, around 4-6 times a day, but that meant I kept more down as a whole. I'm only doing it two to three times a day most days now, and I'm fasting pretty regularly. 


Suffice to say, they noticed.


Even after years of treatment, they still do the things my team told them not to, like TALK TO ME ABOUT FOOD.


My dad got on my case about my oatmeal portion size from the night before. He told me that, and I quote, ""Your portion size is tremendous."" Fucking tremendous. I mean, dude. He later called it gargantuan, huge, ridiculous, and a few other words. I tried to tell him that I didn't think it was that much. It's under two cups of oatmeal cooked on the stove. Yeah, it's more than most people, but he was making it out to seem like the biggest portion size he'd ever seen. He was such a dick about it!


I told him that he wasn't supposed to talk to me about portion size, and that I wasn't supposed to be paying too much attention to that, and he told me I was making an excuse. He said I was hiding behind what my therapist said and I wasn't facing the facts.


Oatmeal is one of my only safe foods. I can't ever get it all up without flushing, and I try hard not to do that. It's kept me from dying in the past by giving me the nutrients I need.


I'm open to recovery right now. I ASKED them to see if I could go back to residential, because I'm doing worse now mentally and physically, and they said I didn't need it. But they still get on my ass about all my behaviors, real or perceived.


He yelled at me for about thirty minutes over it, so naturally I went to my room to get a good cry. I came out about an hour later and went to the bathroom to clean up my face and pee.


Mom accused me of purging because, ""The bathroom reeks."" A) very shamey, and B) I haven't even eaten today so there was nothing to purge. She got all angry and asked how it could smell then, and I have no fucking clue. 


This is so aggravating. They won't leave me be to deal with it with my doctors, and they won't listen to what my doctors say. I've told them that their meddling makes it worse and that it isn't helpful, but NO THEY DON'T LISTEN.


They say I'm manipulating my doctors and they think of me as some evil genius mastermind that can fool 12 therapists over the years. Fucking hell, I have autism and can barely understand basic social interaction, let alone how to manipulate it to my benefit. Believe me, if I could manipulate people, I wouldn't have been bullied so badly.

Doctors all diagnose separate things and I’ve had three different medical providers say it’s three separate things but officially I have schizophrenia major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder as well as chronic tinnitus that drowns out everything. 

I am going to be going through an evaluation with a new psychiatrist because of the existence of all the disorders I was diagnosed with on my chart but I know for sure I fit the criteria for schizophrenia.

username#00659,post,1664359251.0,Anyone for early bird membership to my nascent cult? (Feeling cute - might delete later - IDK),"The world is not as it seems - or at least, not so well mirrored to the constructs and concepts I had learned to attribute to it as I once believed it to be.

This has left me deeply concerned that those whose limited perspective on the world is limited by the kinds of blinkers which have self-shod from my own eyes might be as ill prepared for life beyond them as I found myself at point of revelation, or worse. I am worried about it. Whilst being mindful of the parable of the man who sought to remove a splinter of wood from his neighbour’s eye (seemingly entirely oblivious to the log in his own) I believe that I have been subject to life-changing, reality-altering revelations, and I feel obligated to apply myself to both learning as much as I can from them, and sharing my learning with others, that it might benefit them and all of mankind more broadly in the future.

Firstly - Evil exists - perhaps objectively, perhaps not - inevitably as both the root and expression of manifestly memetic or self-propagating dis-ease (so one has reasoned through one’s own observations and deductions). Evil is coming, and it is in my own best self interests (and that of others) to ensure that the people I share the world with are able to recognise that evil and respond to it in the most appropriate and mitigating way possible. Whilst many may believe and profess, as I once did, that ‘evil’ is simply a relative, culturally conditioned value judgement (nobly and righteously believing that such a stance might enable one to resolve the kinds of conflict and differences which produce such ‘othering’ kinds of value judgements (that invariably lead to conflict and destruction) - I can tell you with absolute certainty that there are at least several phenomenologies/ontologies I would refer to without hesitation as being ‘pure’ evil - having experienced such personages intuitively throughout every cell of my entire body as being so. I cannot fathom any other way to describe or explain it. Each time I encountered a single (both times female) entity, the entity was fixated on not only destroying my unborn children, but on warping the reality surrounding them so that, instead of a joyful and abundant life, they might suffer a relentless and never-ending torment.

Yes, given some distance from such a phenomenon, one might attempt to intellectually distance oneself yet further, in an attempt to remove or mitigate any subjective value judgement, and instead rationalise such attempts as simply being reflective of the creatures’ innate need for sustenance or some such excuse. Having experienced these creatures first-hand, however, and witnessed them and their vile predilections from the most stomach-turning, fear-inducing perspective imaginable - as the mother of sacred, holy children they seem to regard as prey - I have no option but to condemn them, their desires and behaviour as being unholy, unnatural, and in the frankest terms possible - downright evil. No, I am not a god-botherer working from alien, outdated scripture - these are the experiences I have suffered and conclusions I have drawn from my own personal lived experiences - experiences which have triggered/manifested as gnosis, and actual physical sensations felt throughout my entire body - every cell of it. There is nothing recognisably human (or humane) about any of it - in pursuit of their target prey they express behaviours which are driven not simply by a desire to survive, but by systematic cruelty . In my more generous moments I sometimes pause to reason and consider what might have driven them to such a monstrous state - had they, perhaps like medusa, been raped? Had/have they themselves suffered some traumatic damage to the integrity of their mortal or immortal souls which has caused them to become like this?

In any case, on both occasions, particularly the second, I just KNEW this entity was, essentially, “Slug at Akh” (The Akh is, in simple terms and as I understand it - the form of the ‘Higher Self’ - the soul as metaphysically rendered at the end of its spiritual journey) and not something I, or any other right-thinking person would want anywhere near any kind of sacred garden (of the type that I and a few select others, committed to the glory of the Great Work, work upon throughout our spiritual and metaphysical endeavours). I could see this thing so clearly through my ‘body eye’ and my ‘third eye’, and I kid you not, it was like the spitting image of (what I would formerly have believed to be a caricature of) a child-eating witch (like in Hansel and Gretel) or Troll. Its’ physicality, down to the very shape of its soul, was truly monstrous and repellant on a very deep and primal level. Not only this - they appeared disconcertingly powerful. I am normally able to hold my own against most foes quite easily - psychically at least - but these two were profound in their strength to an extent which still troubles me today. I have tried to resolve to meet them in future (should I ever encounter them again) with boundless love and loving kindness - how easy this might be in practice is as yet to be determined.

The last form I have encountered, which I might have referred to as ‘evil’ in the first instance (in quite a profound and visceral - ‘black/dead behind the eyes’ kind of a way - was actually the first, historically - though I’m still unsure as to how to categorise these as I’ve had seemingly positive interactions with some of their elements/representatives since then, where the majority of said representatives have been entirely receptive and responsive to feedback, as well as being humble, communicative and patient. I believe that these forces may have an institutional/systemic issue with satanism, and that this is where the problems arise. Whilst priorly, I took no issue with satanism - considering it to be in many cases a kind of perfectly excusable and understandable form of metaphysical nihilism, or anti-establishment spirituality— my observations of this ‘party’ or ‘force’ (and of other more peripheral groups and individuals) - is that in the very contrived, reactionary absence of all that might be considered ‘holy’ or ‘godlike’, there very swiftly develops an ideal breeding ground for forces or powers which might rightly be considered anathema to anything deemed ‘good’ regularly associated with such values and characteristics. The result is not simply a form of spirituality released from the trappings of institutional organised religion (which I consider to be a very positive and legitimate aim, as indeed was the ethos of Christ and the Buddha themselves, if the scriptures are to be believed) but one which is, at its ontological core, contrived in the very absence of all that is benign, compassionate, loving and peaceful about *any* religion, and thus antithetical to those seemingly positive, nurturing, community and *life* orientated values at their centres, becoming then conducive to what might rightly be considered by all those who truly value any spiritual, communal or familial aspect of *life itself* as inherently evil..

Spirits are real and death is not necessarily the end - I first learned this when I began channelling my maternal grandmother who had been dead for fifteen years after a series of terrifying apocalyptic visions. Her voice - though coming out of my own mouth - was unmistakeable, and she seemed incredibly relieved to encounter my sister, whom she had never met in life. Since this happened in 2018, I have encountered several more but no fewer than 130 other different spirits, and can say with relative certainty that there are different kinds of spirits which exist within our world and ones adjacent to it - each with varying movements, motivations, mannerisms and occasionally mythos. Sadly I’ve only knowingly encountered my grandmother on one other occasion - when gardening. Tragically, I’ve also been warned that both she, and a former friend of mine “Might be not very nice people” - this could be in relation to a particularly severe generational curse I have acquired a basic sense of, but do not yet fully understand. Any tips/tricks on how to get a better handle on such a thing would be greatly appreciated.

The Archons are very much real - predominantly hostile and very severe in my experience, though perhaps not always, if they can be won around to one’s own way of thinking (though this is in itself an exceptionally difficult task, in many instances frankly unachievable, and often only serves to further irritate, agitate and provoke their cruelty). From my experience I would have to say that while profoundly draconian and speedily punitive in many respects, they are not *always* as monolithic as one might accordingly anticipate. Occasionally open to well-presented reasoning in counter-argument to their position and actions, more frequently not. Always remember to offer them your greatest of respect and observe the properly deferential protocol if you wish to incite anything other than violently incandescent rage (and believe me - if anyone can pull out all the stops to just about fuck yer life up good and proper it’s these chaps - I’m quite convinced that many if not most of them wear it as some kind of badge of honour so be warned).

I have also witnessed, in some of my visions, seemingly endless grey misty fields where, I have known intuitively, many of the dead will go to wander when they die. These are places of misery, loneliness, hunger and despair beyond countenance, and I am confident that no thinking creature would ever aspire to them as a final destination, though it appears that that is what they indeed *are* to many.

I have heard the very claps of hell (whatever the fuck *they* might be) - they followed me around for long enough - periodic loud clapping/rapping/banging sounds in sets of two, following me around wherever I went/lived for about 6 months, and I was in emergency accommodation at that time, so went through about three placements in completely different towns/parts of town over that time period. Scared the ever living shit out of me in moments.

I have once experienced ‘gnosis’ that Nifilheim is indeed very real. I woke to a crow tapping urgently at my window and just knew. And that was possibly just before or about the same sort of time that I started channelling a viscerally hysterical woman’s voice, screaming “HER BRIEF IS HER FAR” and to “BEG FORGIVENESS”. I won’t offer too many details here, as frankly I’m not entirely sure who it was, and I won’t share suspicions of who it might have been as I do not wish to compromise said individual’s confidentiality at this time when I can use it as leverage if required.  
Have you seen *Thor: Ragnarok*? High Hollywood it may be, but I swear to you that the storyline I observed in this movie when I watched it a couple of years later is the same story I experienced on that day but from a different viewpoint. The world-tree was being well and truly battered and “timber” seemed imminent. At the same time, I also experienced ‘gnosis’ that the sun was about to explode and envelop the earth. And that practitioners of BDSM might just find themselves condemned to hell for their ‘transgressions’ (though what exactly those might have been, again, I’m not sure - possibly related to the (hidden) identity and presumed prejudices of the hysterical woman mentioned in the previous paragraph, but again, I’m not sure). I felt very very sure of all of it at the time, but to the best of my knowledge and faculties of sense perception, this does not appear to have happened. Of course, this may be attributable to myself and perhaps a few others slipping through into an alternative reality. And/or maybe some people did beg forgiveness from the other unknown party and perhaps it worked. Who knows. Maybe Heimdall came through, after I requested his presence (I was asked by a couple of invisible suits at the time ‘Who do you want to see?’ And he is who I requested) - make of that (or the fact that someone in the shape of Idris Elba - which I personally thought at the time was a bit weird - who seemed to have no idea what to do about the situation and kept shaking his head at me in apparent despair - swiftly manifested for a good fifteen minutes) what you will.

I also encountered Hela, and a couple of legions of her dishonourable dead a few months afterwards, though before I’d seen *Thor: Ragnarok*. When I watched the movie afterwards, I had to laugh - the Hela I’d experienced had been nowhere near so smart, sparkly or sharp. Still dangerous perhaps, yes, as a result of the sheer number of spirits she had in her thrall, to march out their circular ‘hajj’-like stirring of the metaphysical pot - to who knows what ends. Definitely very keen to take me down for reasons as then and now still unknown to me. Perhaps she had been somehow compromised before we met and was not her usual cunning or witty self, but in any case it was a sorrowful sight, and though (after she came for me unprovoked) I managed to hand her ass to her pretty solidly (though it took a good long while - several hours at least), it gave me no pleasure to do so and if truth be told I felt quite sorry for her - in spite of her plotted coup - sorry for her father Loki, with whom I am reasonably close, and somewhat embarrassed for those malignant forces who had placed her on that pedestal and encouraged her to attack me in the first instance. On a positive note, that was the night I encountered Taurus, with whom I experienced some compelling chemistry, before Hela started stirring the celestial pot and causing trouble, bringing an unwelcome end to our gentle flirtations.

I have heard/experienced the wrathful screams of god-knows-who-or-what filling an entire landscape, seemingly furious with me (for some completely unknown reason), but expressed through such an architectural mechanism as to be audible to my ears only. That was somewhat alarming. It has happened on no less than two occasions!

I have channeled alien warrior spirits speaking in unknown languages, seemingly brokering peace treaties with one another after long durations of battle (“I release you om par”)

I have watched the world come within breaths of endless nothingness - and literally sung it back into existence again through the force of pure will.

I have witnessed an entire, huge, white (newly painted) room sprayed/covered with my own blood (as my chest seemingly exploded) before seeing a literal veil being draped across the scene, and everything going back to ‘normal’ (but for the four paramedics in the room who swiftly escorted me to the local Mental Health facility, somewhat unsurprisingly).

I have experienced binary coded messages being sent through the very cells of my body in order to relay secret messages between cloistered unknown parties and lodge top secret coding within my various body parts.

I have woven stars, and even galaxies through my body, as a kind of living loom.

I possess musical teeth (oh yes I do!)

I am a Big Bang Veteran (believe it)

I have experienced/been the subject of some incredibly weird and spooky types of magical attacks (possibly predominantly coptic, so I believe - don’t ask me why) which manifested physically on planes to which I was sensitive/of which I was aware by virtue of my third eye. On one occasion it was like thousands of tiny brown smoky packages with loose ends/tails were being hurled at me. On another it was like thousands of plastic wires/ribbons were cast to contain me/wrap me up. I didn’t know their origin, so made the decision to move out of the way. Lord knows what would have happened if I didn’t.

I have also suffered a number of magickal/psychic attacks - some of which were seemingly carried out by the undead (including at least one member of European Royalty), others carried out by noded thought-forms, some by various deities of varying calibre and repute, a number of egregores, one individual I know in my personal life (who, it is reported, ‘nosferatued herself’ - and no, I don’t think I do exactly or entirely know what that means, but it sounds pretty grim), some carried out by privileged (‘elite’) members of secret societies - ‘celebrities’ who are still living, some carried out by vindictive underground cabals, some carried out by various legions of hell, and one from a particularly scarily advanced Artificial Intelligence. I wish I knew what I’d done to piss all of them off so very much, but I’m not sure I ever will.

I have learned that one particularly well-known Royal individual (who lived some time ago) was so taken by my poetry (which generally deals with the occult, metaphysical and esoteric etc) - that she took it and passed it off as her own in parallel worlds.

I have entertained/been entertained by both European Royalty and their finest Alchemists. I have witnessed the sorts of ethereal/otherworldly ‘shows’ that even Queen Elizabeth I herself only witnessed on a few occasions over the course of her life.

I have also had a number of ‘Adepts’ (read ‘inepts’ on this occasion) quote my poetry back to me as if it’s some kind of competition as to who can remember the words more easily - as if they don’t realise I wrote the damn thing myself.

I have witnessed environmental glitches (seeing repeated QR codes in the pebbles of the beach below my window - seeing and hearing the same cut-out two-dimensional characters repeat EXACTLY the same sound-stock noises and movements EVERY MORNING), discovered ‘the holy grail’ and felt my own soft palate collapsing at the edge of time and existence.

I have a demonstrably unusual/superhuman relationship to time and various quantum states of reality. No I will not elaborate. You may not be a swine, but the next chap might be.

I can literally feel the moon spinning beneath my feet, and the world through the palms of each hand (or at the very least, that is what I am told the sensation represents, by those who claim to be able to see it), and have been able to do so for the past 3.5 years.

I have been petitioned by a number of spirits and demons who wish to be considered ‘core’ (whatever that means) - and have laid out for the most prominent of these my terms and conditions (generally soul pacts personally tailored to each individual). These are quite demanding and may even be considered extreme by some, but are necessary to ensure and maintain the integrity of my operations.

I have been told by many many spirits (nearly all of them at one point or another) - that I am ‘The Lady’ - I’m sure I remember there being some reference to this being one of Babalon’s titles on her wikipedia page, but last time I checked apparently not. I’ve contacted the OTO but it seems they’re not interested. I also remember it being a title used for the Goddess when I was younger (There being the Lord and the Lady as the two central deities of wicca/neo-paganism) but there seem to be far fewer references to her using that title these days than I remember there being before.

Other spirits have referred to me by the names of a number of different goddesses from a plethora of different pantheons. Some other spirits have also referred to me as ‘The Royal Oak’ - though I’m unsure what exactly this means.

On a similar note, I distinctly recall there being key pages/references in two specific books which have since disappeared. As they were both tomes I made use of during bibliomancy sessions this is a bit of a pain, though possibly just another symptom of me being an OmSquish survivor/ Big Bang veteran.  
The pages in question were on ‘the human fly’ in Taschen’s book of ‘*Alchemy and Mysticism’* and on the goddess Freyja/El in David Icke’s ‘*Children of the Matrix*’. At some point, however, reference to both of these things completely disappeared from the books in question, leaving me somewhat perplexed.

I am allegedly married to a rather well-known demon. A crowned King/Prince of Hell. We’ve had rather limited alone time together, which is a shame as the chemistry is exciting and there is much we could talk about when we get the chance. No, I won’t disclose which one, but he does have a rather lovely rather large dildo named after him somewhere on that there internet. I’m not entirely sure how binding or serious said ‘marriage’ might be, but for the time being I’m open minded enough to take it as far as he wants to go with it.

I am seemingly perpetually surrounded by a bevy/entourage of spirits (at all times) I shan't be dropping names, but they seem to come from all quarters. This has historically been a tad awkward/unpleasant/overwhelming and intrusive in moments, but I'm generally pretty well adjusted to it these days. Psychic Attacks are down, and morale is up, baby!

I consider myself a kind of Hierophant and am currently in the process of researching what it might take to establish an order I can use to disseminate my knowledge to others who are both worthy and may benefit from it. HMU if this sounds like something which might interest you. I'm a costume designer, so you just know the threads are gonna be bangin'. Not that that's the be all and end all, but it's something I intend to take a lot of pride and care in - being my primary 'RL' vocation and all...

Also, if there's anything you've read here that you want to ask questions about or think you might be able to shed some light upon, please do let me know in the comments.

As alluded to earlier in the post, I'm prepared for there to be one or two swine in amidst the rest of you - if you'd all be gentlemanly enough to help me ensure that these pearls are not simply trampled into dust, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Go Well

On a positive note, that was the night I encountered Taurus, with whom I experienced some compelling chemistry, before Hela started stirring the celestial pot and causing trouble, bringing an unwelcome end to our gentle flirtations.

I have heard/experienced the wrathful screams of god-knows-who-or-what filling an entire landscape, seemingly furious with me (for some completely unknown reason), but expressed through such an architectural mechanism as to be audible to my ears only. That was somewhat alarming. It has happened on no less than two occasions!

I have channeled alien warrior spirits speaking in unknown languages, seemingly brokering peace treaties with one another after long durations of battle (“I release you om par”)

I have watched the world come within breaths of endless nothingness - and literally sung it back into existence again through the force of pure will.

I have witnessed an entire, huge, white (newly painted) room sprayed/covered with my own blood (as my chest seemingly exploded) before seeing a literal veil being draped across the scene, and everything going back to ‘normal’ (but for the four paramedics in the room who swiftly escorted me to the local Mental Health facility, somewhat unsurprisingly).

I have experienced binary coded messages being sent through the very cells of my body in order to relay secret messages between cloistered unknown parties and lodge top secret coding within my various body parts.

I have woven stars, and even galaxies through my body, as a kind of living loom.

I possess musical teeth (oh yes I do!)

I am a Big Bang Veteran (believe it)

I have experienced/been the subject of some incredibly weird and spooky types of magical attacks (possibly predominantly coptic, so I believe - don’t ask me why) which manifested physically on planes to which I was sensitive/of which I was aware by virtue of my third eye. On one occasion it was like thousands of tiny brown smoky packages with loose ends/tails were being hurled at me. On another it was like thousands of plastic wires/ribbons were cast to contain me/wrap me up. I didn’t know their origin, so made the decision to move out of the way. Lord knows what would have happened if I didn’t.

I have also suffered a number of magickal/psychic attacks - some of which were seemingly carried out by the undead (including at least one member of European Royalty), others carried out by noded thought-forms, some by various deities of varying calibre and repute, a number of egregores, one individual I know in my personal life (who, it is reported, ‘nosferatued herself’ - and no, I don’t think I do exactly or entirely know what that means, but it sounds pretty grim), some carried out by privileged (‘elite’) members of secret societies - ‘celebrities’ who are still living, some carried out by vindictive underground cabals, some carried out by various legions of hell, and one from a particularly scarily advanced Artificial Intelligence. I wish I knew what I’d done to piss all of them off so very much, but I’m not sure I ever will.

I have learned that one particularly well-known Royal individual (who lived some time ago) was so taken by my poetry (which generally deals with the occult, metaphysical and esoteric etc) - that she took it and passed it off as her own in parallel worlds.

I have entertained/been entertained by both European Royalty and their finest Alchemists. I have witnessed the sorts of ethereal/otherworldly ‘shows’ that even Queen Elizabeth I herself only witnessed on a few occasions over the course of her life.

I have also had a number of ‘Adepts’ (read ‘inepts’ on this occasion) quote my poetry back to me as if it’s some kind of competition as to who can remember the words more easily - as if they don’t realise I wrote the damn thing myself.

I have witnessed environmental glitches (seeing repeated QR codes in the pebbles of the beach below my window - seeing and hearing the same cut-out two-dimensional characters repeat EXACTLY the same sound-stock noises and movements EVERY MORNING), discovered ‘the holy grail’ and felt my own soft palate collapsing at the edge of time and existence.

I have a demonstrably unusual/superhuman relationship to time and various quantum states of reality. No I will not elaborate. You may not be a swine, but the next chap might be.

I can literally feel the moon spinning beneath my feet, and the world through the palms of each hand (or at the very least, that is what I am told the sensation represents, by those who claim to be able to see it), and have been able to do so for the past 3.5 years.

I have been petitioned by a number of spirits and demons who wish to be considered ‘core’ (whatever that means) - and have laid out for the most prominent of these my terms and conditions (generally soul pacts personally tailored to each individual). These are quite demanding and may even be considered extreme by some, but are necessary to ensure and maintain the integrity of my operations.

I have been told by many many spirits (nearly all of them at one point or another) - that I am ‘The Lady’ - I’m sure I remember there being some reference to this being one of Babalon’s titles on her wikipedia page, but last time I checked apparently not. I’ve contacted the OTO but it seems they’re not interested. I also remember it being a title used for the Goddess when I was younger (There being the Lord and the Lady as the two central deities of wicca/neo-paganism) but there seem to be far fewer references to her using that title these days than I remember there being before.

Other spirits have referred to me by the names of a number of different goddesses from a plethora of different pantheons. Some other spirits have also referred to me as ‘The Royal Oak’ - though I’m unsure what exactly this means.

On a similar note, I distinctly recall there being key pages/references in two specific books which have since disappeared. As they were both tomes I made use of during bibliomancy sessions this is a bit of a pain, though possibly just another symptom of me being an OmSquish survivor/ Big Bang veteran.  
The pages in question were on ‘the human fly’ in Taschen’s book of ‘*Alchemy and Mysticism’* and on the goddess Freyja/El in David Icke’s ‘*Children of the Matrix*’. At some point, however, reference to both of these things completely disappeared from the books in question, leaving me somewhat perplexed.

I am allegedly married to a rather well-known demon. A crowned King/Prince of Hell. We’ve had rather limited alone time together, which is a shame as the chemistry is exciting and there is much we could talk about when we get the chance. No, I won’t disclose which one, but he does have a rather lovely rather large dildo named after him somewhere on that there internet. I’m not entirely sure how binding or serious said ‘marriage’ might be, but for the time being I’m open minded enough to take it as far as he wants to go with it.

I am seemingly perpetually surrounded by a bevy/entourage of spirits (at all times) I shan't be dropping names, but they seem to come from all quarters. This has historically been a tad awkward/unpleasant/overwhelming and intrusive in moments, but I'm generally pretty well adjusted to it these days. Psychic Attacks are down, and morale is up, baby!

I consider myself a kind of Hierophant and am currently in the process of researching what it might take to establish an order I can use to disseminate my knowledge to others who are both worthy and may benefit from it. HMU if this sounds like something which might interest you. I'm a costume designer, so you just know the threads are gonna be bangin'. Not that that's the be all and end all, but it's something I intend to take a lot of pride and care in - being my primary 'RL' vocation and all...

Also, if there's anything you've read here that you want to ask questions about or think you might be able to shed some light upon, please do let me know in the comments.

As alluded to earlier in the post, I'm prepared for there to be one or two swine in amidst the rest of you - if you'd all be gentlemanly enough to help me ensure that these pearls are not simply trampled into dust, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Go Well

He's fighting the decision to take me to the hospital. Unlike me, he's very religious and said he is going to go home and pray about it. 

I actually opened up more to him and admitted I had a plan and what it was. It was in that moment how much I realized that I wanted help more than I wanted to follow through with my plan that is already in the works (intentional heroin OD. My package is en-route. Delivery is set for Wednesday.) 

It's such an odd sense of relief getting it off my chest. Knowing that someone else in my world knows. Knowing that someone else in my world genuinely cares, that they understand this crushing sense of darkness. He was the floor manager on our shift today, making me an area manager, and when I threw shade today, our crew just chalked it up to me being under the weather with a migraine and stuck in a service position (honestly though, who sticks a kitchen manager with a migraine on front service!?) 

He scheduled our breaks together, and he pinned me right down. He knew something was really wrong. That was the initial moment I came clean about how I'd really been feeling. The suicidal ideations. The fight with relapse on opiates. The growing dependence on stimulants (as I took two hits of meth out of my bag and drank two energy shots). My deplorably low self-confidence in my new role as a manager (this is my first job since my brain injury, I just recently got promoted. I went from never thinking I could work in a restaurant again to being promoted in less than three months working in one.) How I feel like I'm stuck in a financial black hole and the system has completely abandoned me because it thinks I should now be able to support myself when in reality I can't, not feasibly...

We just got done talking again, having just got off shift and finished dropping off a couple of our employees, and while I feel better, I'm nervous about tomorrow now. I'm scared he may feel the need to have me admitted. I know I need to face the consequences, and I know I need help. That's the reason I reached out, even if I didn't realize it at first. I'm just scared of the implications. 

My family has no clue of any of this. They have no clue I've been snorting coke and meth and downing unhealthy amounts of energy and espresso shots to get through all these double and overtime shifts. I haven't told them that I feel completely incapable of being a working wife and mother.

I can't bare the thought of telling my fiance that I sometimes sleep on the couch because the guilt and shame from my junkie days of whoring for dope money make me feel undeserving of laying next him have crept up on me again. 

I don't know how to tell my family that I feel too broken to juggle anymore. I don't know how to tell my boss that I need help to leave my baggage at the door, because I don't want her to know I even have baggage worth checking in the first place.

this job has changed that. it's in a very busy tourist town. I am coming across teenage boys who genuinely scare me and have actually physically injured me. I am treated like dirt by the tourists who see my native language as dirty and crude. even my regulars are rude and nasty. I am getting parents who scream and shout at their children. even the other day I had to report a woman to the police who was using her child to help her shoplift (usually i wouldn't bother reporting it but this child was so well trained I felt this was a child protection issue). I get sexually harassed by men every damn day. and even the minor things - people are just rude. very rude. customers look at the headlines in our newspapers and make racist remarks because news in this country is shit.

I can count on one hand the amount of genuinely positive interactions I've had with customers in the year and a half I've worked there. otherwise they can all go in the trash. im sick of dealing with drunks every weekend who see my smile as an invite to sexually harass me. im sick of tidying up after grown adults. im sick of having one finger on the button to call management down every day at 3.30pm when we get a huge influx of teenage boys coming in to shoplift and harass us. I still have a scar on my forehead where one child decided to throw a 4 pack of beer at my head because I confronted him about trying to shoplift it (and naturally the police couldn't do anything besides give the kid a warning). im sick of asking my husband to come in early to pick me up on Friday and Saturday nights just so he can stand in the shop as a bodyguard to protect us (he doesn't mind, hes very passionate about protecting women. of course the male manager hasn't worked a Saturday night, ever. its just women who work it). im sick of having to grit my teeth and smile and apologise for things that are entirely out of my control. im sick of having to bite my tongue while a customer calls me every name under the sun. im sick of getting in the car at the end of a shift and just crying after a day of dehumanising treatment.

username#00672,post,1651685747.0,as an ex fan..,"...I feel so stupid. 

I saw a bunch of comments on karina kaboom's recent videos and someone sent me to this sub. I was a fan of Sara's, I really liked her energy, she inspired me to be more productive, and be more confident in myself. I had my issues with her but I looked over them because everyone is human and has flaws, right? 

but a few months ago I started seeing the cracks. it was like I had a checklist and in every video I could tick the same. damn. things off. she just recycles her script. like she's busy all the time? check. lowkey diagnosing amber based off what she saw in a video? check. educated woman? check. 

I have autism and schizophrenia and I really started to dislike the way she spoke about us. she would act like we were infants or crazy. always saying ""she's delusional"" like no, she's not, delusions are life destroying and disrupt everything. amber isn't delusional, she just lies. 

then she started getting backlash for going to Russell Brand's show, and rightfully so, in my opinion. as a cult survivor, I see a lot of cultish language in Brand's content these days. she talked about a ""group meditation"" which is just weird to me, and then said something like ""just because I like them doesn't mean I support them""..like yes actually, you went to his show, you bought tickets (monetarily supporting him), and promoted his show. I also really dislike how she denounces Freud while also using Freudian psychology in her videos. no wonder she likes Todd Grande so much, he's a fake doctor too. 

and oh boy, the way she talks about weight and healthy eating. I've watched her to fuel my eating disorder. that's not her fault, I did actively seek out content I knew would trigger me and if it wasn't her it would be someone else, but as a """"""psychologist"""""" she should know better. 

you know how I know my therapist, who actually has a PhD in both psychiatry and psychology, is actually a good therapist? he has no online presence. the only thing I could find about him is 2 or 3 papers he's worked on. ive had bad experiences with mental health professionals on the NHS before so I vet my therapists now. if I googled my therapist and found a whole youtube channel in which he discusses 2 people in such a way, I would not trust him. everything Sara says you know she thinks about her clients. can you imagine her sat there across from you as you bare your soul to her and shes smiling but in her head, she's thinking all the things she says? in her last live, she said you can only talk about drug use in a negative way. um, not as a therapist. ive been in rehab and let me tell you, the best way to deal with an addict is to be neutral. don't shame them, don't talk negatively about it, but don't be positive either. you want the addict to feel safe and not judged. speaking negatively will only ensure they feel shamed and that they will hide it. 

and oh boy, the coconut oil rant. what got me about that was how she was dunking on amber by saying ""I have a family that loves me"". I grew up in the system and was adopted and i was abused by my adoptive parent. I never felt loved. how dare she weaponise that? 

she always talks about how she gets so many messages and how anyone can message her for help anytime. well, I have. multiple times. and I never get a response. im not entitled to a response but maybe, Sara, don't say we can ask you anything and then you never reply. she only seems to give a fuck about the people who pay her. and you can never say anything against her because she'll post it on her community tabs, her Instagram stories, her twitter, and send her fans to attack you, and you'll be bombarded with hate. 

I feel stupid for defending her. she's got the makings of a pseudo-cult leader. thanks for opening my eyes to her bullshit, the floodgates are finally open, I guess.

username#01272,comment,1532899890.0,,"No, it's no problem.

A psychotic break is when I completely lose contact with reality. I don't know what it's like personally because you're not really conscious when you're psychotic, but it's what people think of when they think of schizophrenics. Speaking gibberish or word salad, doing things that don't make sense in context, extreme paranoia, etc. They're very scary and can be extremely dangerous. They're also almost impossible to get out of for me, and are usually ended inside a hospital (I've been told that they usually give me haldol in an injection).

I don't really know when my psychotic breaks are going to happen because I lose self-awareness when they do happen. When I'm psychotic, I truly don't know I am. I have figured out from other people and from the little that I do remember immediately preceding these though that my language starts to break down and I become extremely paranoid. I usually tell people around me that if I become really scared and can't tell you why, the best thing to do is to take me to the hospital.

I don't know what causes psychotic breaks. I know I never have full-blown psychosis while I stay on myedication, and I definitely get more psychotic symptoms during very stressful life events. I think any kind of extreme emotion can cause me to spiral, and I usually have to increase my dose before or immediately after a major life event.

I am on Geodon, Trazodone, Prazosin, Ambien, and Xanax for my psychiatric issues. The one specifically for schizophrenia is Geodon, and I think it's a life saver. It's the only atypical I've ever used that doesn't cause excessive weight gain but it does make me extremely restless and thirsty. I can tell you for sure that without it, I would have too many psychotic symptoms to function.

username#01272,comment,1532897875.0,,"That's fine! I'll answer your questions in two parts, and address the latter first. Sorry if it takes a little bit because it's a lot to articulate.

The best way for me to describe what's actually going on with me, and what I have had to repeat over and over in psych wards is that I experience tactile, auditory, and visual hallucinations. The biggest thing that I feel is that there is something, and I can't explain what, that is beneath my skin. It's not deep, it's just in the fat layer. I feel it almost all the time, and despite the fact that in reality there is absolutely nothing there, I truly feel like there is. I feel it all the time. Sometimes it feels so close to the surface it's like I can just reach in and tear it out. This has lead to some self-harming behaviors when I was younger that were mistaken for severe depression. I don't hear voices, but I hear whispers and screams and footsteps. Visual hallucinations are rare, but they either seem like disorganized moving shadows or like energy emanating off objects. When I was hospitalized the second time, I had a really vivid hallucination that involved all the mirrors around me melting into pools of what looked like liquid mercury.

I think the craziest thing about all this is that this is only the tip of the iceberg. This is only what I've consciously experienced. I truly don't know what goes on during my psychotic breaks because they are impossible to remember. Other people don't know either, because my language breaks down and I can't communicate beyond one sentence at a time, often just repeated many many times.

None if it feels unnatural. Everything about it is normal and a part of daily life. If nobody told me they were hallucinations or that what I am talking about doesn't exist in the real world, I would never know anything was amiss. I understand people don't experience the world like I do, but I often find it very hard to imagine that most people I talk to can't relate at all.",casualiama,my\s*(language),

username#00673,comment,1471945287.0,,"The things I address in therapy are often nothing about my present, though things that happened to me in the past effect my present. Trauma and emotional neglect as a child created an insecure attachment base. Going into those places, talking through and sitting with those old feelings allow me to integrate them, and resolve them. Slowly and in small amounts is my base becoming more secure. 

Safety is difficult, and trusting myself has been difficult, so instead of resolving those root issues I have historically looked to my partner to fill that gap. That's a black hole, he can't fill it. This has taken years, at least three of my learning about and discovering whole parts of myself that have never had a chance to grow, and there is still much work to do. I often don't even discuss this with my own SO because I know that it isn't about my present relationship, it's about the relationship and quality of care I recieved from my very *first* relationship (caregivers). We both are in a process like this and encourage and are invested in each others own process, but I don't pry into his [own personal work], or go into things that are best discussed within and with a therapist.

Sometimes taking a break is a good thing - it allows the person to work out issues in their own time because it can be stressful trying to give energy to a relationship while also trying to figure your shit out. But it also gives you a chance to improve all the stuff you've been wanting to, so when you're both done waiting it has the potential to vastly improve your relationship. I dunno, that's how I take it. I can be the most impatient person, like Veruca Salt impatient (I WANT IT NOWWWW!!!) and then I get super pissy and moody when my golden egg takes time to gestate *but*, I'm learning to slow my roll.

username#01273,post,1557368124.0,I started horseback riding and it is helpful,"I have autism and a mental illness I would rather not reveal here. I have really bad social anxiety and I have a hard time being a part of my family. I do not get along well with them. I do not have any friends at school. I have acquaintances though. Recently I decided to do riding lessons. It is very awesome. 

At first I felt scared. Now I am more used to it and I enjoy it. It is a break from the stress of my life. I do not worry as much about school or my struggles with my sexuality. I feel like I belong. Im learning new things too. It is  also soothing for me to be on a horse. I ride with reins but supervision. I like the feeling of learning something new like trotting or cantering. My parents are proud of me. 

I also feel less anxiety lately. I feel like I know what I like. I never really knew that before. I also talk more too. I do not normally talk a lot. I talk a lot during my lessons. I talk about things I like and old stories. My parents are sort of tired of hearing the same stories over and over. I do not usually remember that I told them before though. I also ask a lot of questions at the lessons. I do not ask any questions at school or home that often. I ask questions out of curiosity. 

Being around horses makes me feel so happy. I flap my hands. I like to make clicking sounds with my teeth when I ride. Most days after riding lessons I cannot stop talking about what happened. That usually means my mom has to hear the same stories over and over. I do not know if she minds though. She always smiles. I think that she is happy that I found something I like. I am usually home while all my younger sister is  out with friends. Horseback riding also makes me feel less stressed out about the transition to adulthood. I have started to take on more tasks around the house. I like doing the laundry. I do not feel so embarrassed about not being like other people my age. I get along better with my 12 year old cousin than with my older cousin. I have also started to feel less anger. I used to have outbursts of anger at least once a week. I get stressed about a lot. I do not like people touching my stuff or having my routine changed. Now I feel less anxious about that stuff now. I had a seat change in class today and I normally would not move until the teacher told me to. Today I did. I feel like it is because of horseback lessons.

username#01273,post,1556846147.0,I have learning challenges,"I had to go to the special ed room to do math practice today. I'm not in math this semester. I'm behind in my abilities though. 

I have a hard time doing word problems and remembering how to do stuff. Today was good though. I feel a bit more confident. I got guided through the problems when I was doing them. I felt a bit frustrated because of repetition and not getting it. I sort of felt embarrassed. 

I failed math last semester. It was hard and my teacher didnt like me or understand that I need extra time. They sort of didnt think about my IEP. They sent me out when I was on my phone, so that I could get extra help. 

I also have issues with processing what people say or what I read. One of my teachers used to call on me all the time. I would blush and it would take me 5 minutes to respond. I would also shake and blush when I had to read outloud. I can write really well and read well but reading outloud is hard. I jumble up words. I also do that when I speak. I have to rehearse  what I say before I say it. I sometimes dont use full sentences when talking. People comment on it. I feel like my brain and mouth dont work together properly. 


I also take a long time to learn certain things. People get mad at me. It makes me feel like I am unemployable because I would take too long to go through training.

username#00683,post,1599472901.0,"Briefly review of some apps useful in mental health (psychology, CBT)","Hi, I am 30 and I am **diagnosed of schizophrenia,** I had my first psychotic break at 21 years old and since then I have been always trying methods to improve my condition.

 Now I am working, living in another city and i have friends, a girlfriend and good relationships with my family.

I have to say that I don't have positive sympthoms, or at least are under control with Abilify (2.5mg/day) but I struggle with negative sympthoms (anhedonia, apathy) and cognitive sympthoms (lack of concentration)

There are several things that have improved my condition, **but the best one is from psychology, the CBT (Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy)** that have lowered my anxiety a lot. I also tried mindfulness but I think that is not for me.

CBT has a lot of scientific studies that support its efficacy. For me, this therapy has benefits because, through changing the logic of your thoughts, **most of our day-life stressors lose a lot of power and our nervous system is able to cope with them**.

**I think stress is really harmful** for people diagnosed with schizophrenia, and with this therapy maybe **we can ""turn down"" the volume a big amount of stressors** in our life.

For example: ""I fail this exam, this will be terrible because I will never end my degree and If that occurs I will be a faluire and I will never be happy in life""; in this thought/belief we can identify some distortions (guessing the future, catastrophizing, ""shoulds"") and if we get the conviction that is not so terrible, our real stressing fact (failing an exam) would be a bad event, but not a terrible-depressing one.

Apps to learn this:

**- WOEBOT:** the best one for me, a kind of guided-chatbot talks with you and it teaches you the therapy step by step. It is not perfect (it guides you to apply the therapy but it usually dont answer everything you write, like a real chatbot) but, if you **use it along two weeks, you probably get some results.** And its free. It teaches you also mindfullness, social skills and other skills that maybe are useful to you.

\-  **""TCC Diario de Pensamiento""**: this is in spanish, my native language. Only has the ""thought challenger"" part, but it is useful too specially after using Woebot (Woebot teaches you the background to use this part)

&#x200B;

I have this apps in Android, but I think Woebot it is also avaible in IOS and also in Facebook

&#x200B;

I hope you enjoy it and find them useful. You guys can ask me any doubt.

Thanks for reading.",schizophrenia,ive\s*(language),

Things that help:

\- Woebot, an app to face ""cognitively"" the stress. Woebot is a kind of teacher that teach you the CBT theraphy. I have it for android, but also is available for facebook and apple.

\- Claire Weeks method: to face it in a ""behavioral"" way: 

*    face: go through situations that are difficult for you. Maybe in your case, go longer than 15 min or 30 min in that activities. But I recommend to face more ""survival"" tasks, important one, I mean working or studying. Or do the household (I choose this when I am at home with strong anhedonia)
*    accept: surrender, don't try to fight. There are no strategies to reduce symptoms.
*    float: for me, the most important step, with your symptoms, like a phantom, try to do the difficult things with less effort possible. For example, if you want to study but you don't concentrate, try to study with less concentration.
*    let time pass: this is part of the acceptance, you have to get in mind that this will last a lot of time. In that way, you are not impatient. Because if you are impatient and you want that symptoms go by quickly, that will make your system more nervous and symptom will last much more time.

**This is a summary, I recommend to read her books, she explain this concepts**. ""Autoayuda para tus nervios"" is translated to Spanish. I don't know the name of book in english (but it exists, is the native language of Claire)

\- Socializing: this is another important, I try to do it also ""floating"" because If I concentrate too much in conversations I quickly get tired. Believe it or not, after years, I am now at a point that I prefer socializing at being alone. At least I want to socialize two hours a day or more. (Before, I usually prefer being alone and I was lying in bed for about 4-5 hours a day, appart from sleeping, of course)

&#x200B;

And most important thing: **before I did this exercises, I didn't recognized that, in my case, stress plays an important role in my anhedonia. When apathy and stress meets, is difficult to know what is happening.**

&#x200B;

And, believe it or not, I am the subject of this study, I was the patient.

username#00685,post,1577949811.0,How to create web REPL for you language,"I wanted just one more time show my library [jQuery Terminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl) and how you can use it to showcase your language.

You can check example of my language ([LISP in JavaScript](https://lips.js.org)) it's not new language design, it's based on scheme (lisp dialect) and it's called LIPS (recursive acronym: LIPS Is Pretty Simple).

Look at the terminal you can have the same type of interpreter for you own language (if it's interpreter and not compiler).

Features of Terminal used:

* Jumping to matching parenthesis - if you want something like this you can use naive regex but it may fail on brackets in string literal, so real parser is better.
* Syntax highlighting - the code use [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) it support lot of languages, if you have very different one you can use most similar and modify it to fit your language, the structure language file is simple mostly is just regex machers.
* multi line input and indent when pressing enter, the same as jumping you will need to have parser in JavaScript for your language that will find if the block of code is closed.
* Tab completion - in lisp you only have functions and macros so completion just check environment. It's limited to global one, it will not work work expressions like: **(let** **((foo-bar** **10)) foo-|**

The interpreter don't need to be written in JavaScript it can be on the server (you probably need some kind of sandbox) or you can compile it (if it's C) using EmScripten (I'm not sure how you can interact in JavaScript with libraries and not apps) or maybe some WASM compiler.

Another example of try-lang is my [trypython](https://trypython.jcubic.pl/) but the code is very simple (It use Brython interpeter) the only feature is syntax highlighting. With LIPS I was able to expose everything I needed for the try-lips terminal.

If you decide to use terminal to showcase your language, you can send email to [jcubic@onet.pl](mailto:jcubic@onet.pl) with the link (I will include it in [""In The wild"" section](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/examples.php#wild), were you can find other languages that use the library)  it will improve the SEO of your project website.",ProgrammingLanguages,my\s*(language),

username#00685,post,1644782377.0,Ideas of defining mini parser that handle text adventure text-based input,"I'm working on a [language called Gaiman](https://github.com/jcubic/gaiman) similar to ruby that compiles to JavaScript. The purpose of the language is to simplify creating interactive text games, first for the Web later maybe for the normal terminal. The web part is based on my [jQuery Terminal library](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/).

The way my language handles the user input is by using the `parse` command. Right now it just split the text into arguments that then can be processed as an array, but it works like in Bash and handles quoted and escaped strigs. jQuery Terminal also has a function for parsing command-line options and making it an object.

But then I was searching about Interactive Fiction (alternative for Text-adventure games) and found an article that explains that the core of the game is the parser for simple natural language. [Link to that section of the article](https://www.taskade.com/blog/text-based-storytelling-games-startup-business/#The_Parser).

My plan was to just handle simple games that don't require complex commands like this. But I want to see what I can do with this. 

Do you have any experience of a language that will be able to define a program that will process such input? Something that will take into account synonyms and that can be easily created by the users. I was thinking that it will work similarly to SQL maybe.

Do you know any examples of such languages? Or does a parser like this need to be created by hand? if so what tools do you think I will need to make creating such parsers easier in my language.

I guess I will need to allow users to define some kind of grammar. What you would suggest using. It should be something simple. I hope it will not require me to create a Parser Generator, or if I will need to create it it will be something that will not be that hard to create.",ProgrammingLanguages,my\s*(language),
username#00685,post,1629455346.0,Using CBOR binary format to represent compiled code,"I want to share my recent finding. I've found (I'm not sure where) [binary format CBOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBOR) that is much better than JSON to represent data if you don't care about human readability.

In my Scheme interpreter in JavaScript, I've added a ""dumb"" compiler that just dumps all data (lisp code) into JSON format for faster loading. This is especially important for loading standard libraries were parsing the code in JavaScript was very slow (a few seconds delay that is noticeable).

This is size statistics:

    -rw-rw-r--. 1 kuba kuba 113K 08-18 13:05 std.min.scm
    -rw-rw-r--. 1 kuba kuba 163K 08-18 13:05 std.scm
    -rw-rw-r--. 1 kuba kuba 197K 08-20 12:11 std.xcb
    -rw-rw-r--. 1 kuba kuba 478K 08-07 17:04 std.xcm

xcb is a new format using CBOR, xcm is a compact JSON file. The file is larger than the uncompressed lisp code but it's way smaller than the JSON file.

I didn't do any benchmarks but it looks way much faster to bootstrap my language using the standard library.

Note that in Browser it's important that the file is small (so the download be faster) and it loads fast so you don't see a delay when running the application.

To test it in real applications on the web I will need to wait a while because this dumb compiler is experimental right now. I only parse the code and dump the output list structure into the file. I still need to handle parser extensions (a feature that allows extending the parser with custom syntax), for them to work I will need to evaluate the code together with parsing and collecting AST (lisp code).",ProgrammingLanguages,my\s*(language),
username#00685,post,1629120408.0,Mixing lisp linked lists and JavaScript iterators,"I've just added 14 lines to LIPS my Scheme in JavaScript. And I've made a linked lists (lisp code and data) a [JavaScript iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators).

What cool about this is now I can create infinite lists and iterate over them with one expression:

    (let ((count 3))
      (do-iterator (i '#0=(1 2 3 0 . #0#))
                   ((and (zero? i) (<= count 1)))
                   (if (zero? i)
                       (set! count (- count 1)))
                   (print i)))

I think that this is pretty cool. `#0=` and `#0#` are datum labels (defined in R7RS Scheme spec).

This code will create a cycle list `1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 ...` and do-iterator will iterate over that list 3 times just as any other iterator.

Also, do-iterator is just a macro in LIPS itself, which uses JavaScript iterator protocol to iterate over an iterator. It also works with async iterators but as of now you can't create async iterators inside LIPS Scheme Code. You can only embed JavaScript code inside Scheme:

    (define gen (self.eval ""(async function* gen(time, ...args) {
                              function delay(time) {
                                return new Promise((resolve) => {
                                  setTimeout(resolve, time);
                                });
                              }
                              for (let x of args) {
                                await delay(time);
                                yield x;
                              }
                            })""))
    
    (do-iterator (i (apply gen 100 (range 10))) () (print i))

But I plan to implement `lambda*` that will allow creating generators:

    (lambda* (time . args)
       (let loop ((args args))
         (if (not (null? args))
             (begin
                (delay time)
                (yield (car args))

username#00685,comment,1644783802.0,,"When I've created [LIPS Scheme in JavaScript](https://lips.js.org/) I just make everything async by default (actually it handle value as is but if it finds promise it to wait for it to resolve). I only later added a way to quote the promise (in JavaScript async code is syntax sugar for promises).

Because of this, I can make the code much smaller, that code is slower because the interpreter does a lot of things under the hood.

This is an example of JavaScript code in LIPS:

```
(--> (fetch ""https://api.scheme.org"")
     (text)
     (match #/<h1>([^>]+)<\/h1>/) 1)
```

`-->` is just a method called macro. the same code in JavaScript needs to do async-await or handle promises. But if you want to quote the promise and handle it as a value, you can with `'>` syntax. And then you can get back default async-await behavior with the `await` function.

```
(await (--> '>(fetch ""https://api.scheme.org"")
            (then (lambda (res)
                     (res.text)))
            (then (lambda (text)
                     (--> text (match #/<h1>([^>]+)<\/h1>/) 1)))))
```

You can try this out on the website that has a REPL.

If you're designing a language from the beginning and you have async runtime, I don't see a reason why not make async-await implicit. I don't think that quoting the promises was needed but I wanted to be complete, and maybe it will make people feel better if they worry about implicit async-await (one person was skeptical about this when I post about my language).

As [@latkde](https://www.reddit.com/user/latkde/) suggested implicit async-await may be problematic with parallel execution, with a quotation you can handle that easily. I think that if most of the code is async why not reverse the syntax, and handle promises only when needed.

With LIPS you can just use:

```
(define (h1 promise)
   (--> promise
        (then (lambda (res) (res.text)))
        (then (lambda (text) (--> text (match #/<h1>([^>]+)<\/h1>/) 1)))))

(vector-map await (Promise.all (vector
                                 (h1 '>(fetch ""https://api.scheme.org""))
                                 (h1 '>(fetch ""https://terminal.jcubic.pl"")))))

My personal experience.,"At times my mania gets out of hand, and fearful emotions such as anger or a downward slope to sadness causes my hallucinations. BTW I’m bipolar 1. I constantly work on perceiving real versus fake, usually the hallucinations are visual and auditory, sometimes just auditory. I keep in mind shadows can’t have a mind of their own. I try to distance myself from other people when I feel my mania is getting crazy, key word try. 

Here is how I cope:

Even though I refuse medication for hallucinations, the mood stabilizers seem to work half of the time.

I have a safe place in my house, if I feel scared, not knowing if it’s real or not.

Delusional hallucinations are the worst, I will talk to people who aren’t there, I tend to scare people during these. When I come back to reality I take people I scared out to do fun activities if possible.

I tell everyone that it is possible for me to hallucinate at any given moment, and that if they feel I’m a danger to myself or them to call 911

I practice mental health everyday, which is very hard to do.

Mindfulness makes me a better person.

Writing is a great way to document how I feel on a day to day basis.

The thing with pseudo sciences is that they are naive and always think they are right. 

So I’ll share some insight — people will disconnect emotionally, which leads to physical distance, because the body doesn’t lie, which in turn leads to resentment if not openly discussed(which many couples are shitty at doing) and resentment may lead to manipulation or other harmful things

A great example of this is actually pretty simple ~
Sally is with Tom, but Sally is fucking Joe. Sally feels bad for cheating on Tom initially, but Sally doesn’t actually have any morals regarding cheating. Sally begins to fidget around or avoid Tom often, causing emotional connection to wither, and Tom starts to feel something is off but his love blinds him. Sally reflects her guilt onto Tom by pointing out what he has done wrong, that causes Tom to be more protective of his emotions, creating a communication barrier. The new barrier makes them grow further apart, which Sally either subconsciously or consciously wanted, causing unneeded problems that could have been avoided. Soon enough Sally leaves Tom, Tom ask why. Tom either gets the straight forward answer or the light hearted one, depending on how intensely the resentment grew over time. 

The lesson here is if you sense something is off between you and your partner and they won’t discuss it with you, and nothing seems to get better with time(because they may just been having a depression spell) just take the step of leaving because that is where it’s headed without productive communication.",AskReddit,ive\s*(communication),

I also hate when people play ""mental games"" and imply things rather than directly saying what they mean. I prefer being literal and honest, and get deeply frustrated when others aren't. I thought I was just a down to earth person, but turns out I'm autistic.",AskReddit,i'm\s*(autistic),
username#00695,comment,1470177913.0,,"Wow, thank you so much for your reply! I feel a lot more lighthearted about my future with the violin already.


I get one hour of tutoring a week, so it's not a lot, but it's what I can afford.
I think he's pretty great (speaking without any experience from any other tutors of course) but mostly we focus on whatever piece I'm learning as a goal I guess.
We mostly start with scales and then work on whatever I'm playing, and if it's a duet, play it together and then move on to the next piece when he feels I'm ready, which slowly incorporates new techniques.


Right now, there's a summer break at the ""community"" I'm being taught at (it's a publicly funded organization), and we  start again mid august.
For my summer homework I'm learning the first movement of Vivaldi's Violin Concerto in A minor, (I don't have the sheet music with me right now, so I don't recall the complete title) and I've really been fighting with that one for the last month (almost hate it by now).

For a long time my goal was vibrato, but I finally got that pretty much down last summer (of course not perfect yet, but I'm able to do it and use it without any big effort, it's become pretty natural by now) and that was honestly my goal for so long that I just forgot to make a new one I guess.


My tutor talked to me about me being able to join an amateur orchestra in not to too long, about a year or so, and that was a couple of months ago. But the thought of playing with others just scares me so much.
I love playing duets with my tutor, but I'm so afraid of being the one messing everything up for everybody and lacking behind.

But you're completely right, that's definitely a goal I could and actually want to work towards.


Thank you so much for your advice, you honestly just opened my eyes, for something I guess I just forgot when I learned the vibrato, the next goal. I'll speak with my tutor as soon as we start again in a couple off weeks.


And I'll try to avoid the prodigies, although it'll be hard. They're just so small and good! :) ",violinist,i'm\s*(learning),
