Back in college I started this job as a delivery driver/cashier at this Japanese restaurant. My first day there I was being trained by a girl that worked there, who was around my age. Most of the kitchen was Mexican or from somewhere in South/Central America where they spoke Spanish. As she is training me and teaching about the orders, I could hear comments from the back that were in the line of ""Oh, I bet they're gonna fuck"" and ""They want each other."" It was funny to me because it was a bunch of grown men gossiping like they were in high school. I didn't really get a chance to talk to them because I was so busy learning the ropes, so I stayed quiet.

At the end of the day the owner asked me if I could could drive the cooks back home since it was on my way. I agreed and we all got in my car and I asked them in Spanish how to get to their place. They were all awkwardly silent for a bit,  but then they started laughing and said, ""You speak Spanish! Well, shit, why the fuck didn't you say so?""

It became a lighthearted car ride and I enjoyed it and their company. We all became friends during my time working there and I would often drive them home because I enjoyed talking with them outside of work.",AskReddit,nationalities
username#00003,comment,2021-05-11 01:20,,"I worked at a place where the owners watched the cameras and called, I just took it but had two co-workers walk out becausr they were sick of it. 

I've shared this story before, but I worked at a sushi restaurant and there was a sushi chef there named Mac that had been there for a while. He was pretty cool and we got along great when we worked together. His girlfriend also worked there as a cashier and a lot of times they were scheduled together.

One Saturday that I was supposed to be off, I get a call from Carol (the bitch boss) asking me if I could come in. Apparently Max and his girlfriend had had enough of her and they both just straight up left and walked out of the restaurant. The place was pretty small so usually it was just the cooks in the back, the sushi chef, and the cashier/delivery driver. So, when they left, they basically left the place empty aside from the cooks, who did not speak English that well.

I decided to take the shift for the extra money and when I got there Carol was already there behind the sushi prep area making orders. She usually didn't come in at all on weekends, but would still watch the security cameras occasionally from her laptop at home and if she saw you standing around doing nothing, she would call and yell at you. It turns out that was exactly what she did to Max and his girlfriend and they had finally had enough. Carol showed me the security footage of Max yelling at her over the phone, hanging up, then taking off his apron and both him and his girlfriend flipping of the security camera and walking out.

She was showing me because she couldn't believe how disrespectful they were and how they could just leave the restaurant like that when there were customers in it. Personally, I thought it was pretty badass they walked out together, I know I wanted to quit hundreds of times when I was there, but I was a broke college student that needed the money.

Last I heard of them was they both got jobs at the sushi place that was competing with this restaurant.",AskReddit,nationalities

For specific beer styles like a hefe, for instance, I obviously will use different strains but for just a clean character this is my go to.

I live in Slovenia, zone 7B where it gets down to -15°C (5°F for all non-EU friends). A couple of days ago, the temperatures were hust below freezing, I forgot my plants outside and flytraps didn't really take much damage. Drosera seedlings, on the other side, froze completely and are now gone.

My question is, since it's below 0 every day now, I brought my plants inside. Clipped all the black bits, drained water a week ago already. I placed them in unheatwd attic with little light, but it's a lot warmer, more than 2-10°C required for dormancy. I'd say it's about 16°C (60°F or so), so now I'm wondering if that is still ok or too warm. I don't have an option to place them in the garage and no place outside because they will freeze.

I also have some questions regarding sarracenias in the pictures, am I required to cut them to the rhysome or not? If so, what time is the best time to do it. I know purpurea will keep its leaves, but leucophylla and barbra probably won't.

I'm not American, but I don't really blame retirees for living the way they want. I can understand wanting to move if the going gets too expensive/crazy/stupid in their home state. And a lifetime house owner is not built to live in an apartment building. My dad for example, who has built houses all his life, would just die there, probably of sheer boredom.

Your housing problems are not even partly due to retirees wanting a house, it's not like there's a lack of land in the US.

What I don't understand is the word ""unamerican"". It's weird term that Americans seem to use to blame and guilt people when they do something they don't like, even if it's not anything illegal, immoral or even inherently wrong.",economy,nationalities

It happens sometimes when he’s going no.2 and he’s slightly hunched over, but other times he’s in my bed with me all curled up and he lets out “the Shiba scream” for about 5-6 seconds. 

Today my girlfriend let him outside when I wasn’t home and she said he screamed and the construction people that were working on the house next door asked if he was okay. I came home about 3 mins after this and she explained it and he’s by our feet and he starts again, and while he screams he lowers himself to the ground. 

We’ve had x-rays done and been to two different vet offices (Japanese ones) and they can’t see anything wrong with him and he doesn’t do it while we’re there. 

He really acts like he’s in pain, I’ve had friends here that had full sized Shiba’s and they say yeah Shiba’s scream like that when something is happening that causes them discomfort or upset.

I've been there since August and one of my coworkers has made life pretty miserable. The man is very self-absorbed, and he LOVES to fight and insult people. He took a particular dislike to me, so he spends basically every shift tearing into me verbally. I get called stupid, worthless, dumb, weak, basically any insult he can think of. He insults my sexuality and makes very jokes about me wanting to have sex with him. He'll insult my work, jumping on me for a little mistake or making up some sort of mistake, or he'll pick at me for being,'too slow' and says I'm worse then the new employees. He's thrown veiled threats at me, and I take them seriously because he's been to jail a few times for beating the crap out of his pregnant ex GF. 

Point being, I don't want to go through this again. I asked management to make him stop in January, and he stopped openly yelling at me, but he now tears me down to my coworkers every chance I get while still saying stuff to me. He's convinced himself I'm dumb or something and he takes it as a personal challenge or purpose to get rid of me, or whatever it is he wants from me.

Anyways, I've went home sick at my stomach so many times. I've been trying to recover from childhood abuse, but he sometimes presses the same buttons and sends me to a bad mental place. Did I forget to mention he picks on my autistic coworker relentlessly as well?

I'm tired of moving jobs, I want to make this one work, but I don't want to deal with this anymore. I wanna go back fighting. Anytime I stand up to him, he makes a bunch of noise and gets us both in trouble. So I can't just go about it by talking it out to him, and I don't think management will help much more.

Now I'm 19 and out on my own at college because I managed to set it all up and pay for it without them knowing. Its been bumpy learning life.

>Like many popular psychology myths, this one grew out of observations of the human brain that were then dramatically distorted and exaggerated.

>Later research has shown that the brain is not nearly as dichotomous as once thought. For example, research has shown that abilities in subjects such as math are strongest when both halves of the brain work together. Today, neuroscientists know that the two sides of the brain collaborate to perform a broad variety of tasks and that the two hemispheres communicate through the corpus callosum.

>The study revealed that while activity was sometimes higher in certain critical regions, both sides of the brain were essentially equal in their activity on average. “It’s absolutely true that some brain functions occur in one or the other side of the brain. Language tends to be on the left, attention more on the right. But people don’t tend to have a stronger left- or right-sided brain network. It seems to be determined more connection by connection,"" explained the study's lead author Dr. Jeff Anderson.

I have basically two reasons for this.

1. I was a Christian for the first 25 years of my life, so these spellings are ingrained in me.

2. I am somewhat of a grammar national socialist and according to grammar rules (at least the ones of my native language), those (pro)nouns are supposed to be capitalized.

2.1. Though ""God"" isn't technically His Name, it functions as such and names are to be capitalized.

2.2. Not adhering to those specific grammar rules out of spite will achieve nothing. I would be spiteful against a nonexistent entity, what good will that do? All it'll do is cause me to be grammatically incorrect, which would only annoy me.

When Linda compliments Du Bois on their work and Du Bois finds it insulting, Dutch says: ""Nee, volgens mij vond ze het echt wat!"" (""No, I think she really liked it!"")

Dutch at one point says: ""Ik heb water in mijn laarzen,"" which Du Bois translates as ""ART TAKES TIME!!!"" What he acrually said was: ""I've got water in my boots."" At the end of the episode this is referenced again: ""Zere voeten en nog steeds nat, gedverderrie!"" (""Sore feet and they're still wet! Gross/Darnit!"")

The name Victor Verliezer in MML. ""Verliezer"" = ""Loser"" in Dutch.

Beauford van Stomm (P&F) has Dutch family (Isabella: ""I thought your [Beauford's] family was from The Netherlands..."" Beauford: ""No can do, Phineas! My family is coming over from the Low Country [The Netherlands]!""). ""Van"" = ""of/from"", ""stom"" = ""stupid/dumb/mute""

I was in 6th grade and I lived in a neighborheed where the elementry school had a big playground and almost everyone of all ages came there to hangout, play and stuff. So me and my friends come every evenign in the summer and they texted em they were gonna be late as they were stopping by a 7-11 to buy some soda for all of us as we had a party planned tom. So I'm just on the swings on my phone and remeber that there are at least 10 diffrenct free ones open. I had the 7 that time.

Some kid comes up to me and starts complimenting my phone and asks if I have any games. I say yes and he starts to bother me to play some of them. I say no bcuz I dont trust anyone with my phone especially 5 yr olds. I respectfully say no and just walk away as I was going to call my friends to hurry.

The kid goes running off and 10 minutes later comes out with a Karen. This is the most white Karen ever. She has everything you would expect. She starts saying I'm discriminating against her son cuz I'm not letting him play while I let my sister call our mom.

The little kid starts to get bratty and starts having temper tantrums and screaming. One thing you should note about me is that I'm patient when someone insults me but when they start going after my family I lose it. My friends know that as I once got in a fight with one of them.

&#x200B;

She starts berating me and how immigrates were ruining her pure America. I'm Indian btw. Meanwhile this POS is sneaking by and he hits me in the back with a big branch. I'm a big dude and can take most stuff without being hurt. SO this em sees the chance and takes my phone and starts kicking me. I'm meanwhile patiently asking fro my phone back and a crowd's starting to gather.

&#x200B;

She then starts going on off my dad and mom and that's when I lost it. I get up wedgie the little kid so hard and shove the Em hard away. Just as that happens my friends pull up and ask wtf is gong on.

I explain the situation while Em plays the victim. My phone is shattered and completely wrecked.

The police are called and starts crying. But the crowd is the evidence and camera's that I acted in self defense. She got arrested, her child got placed in custody and she had to pay for my phone.

&#x200B;

There's one more story where she challenges me to a fist fight and tried to take a punch at me with brass knuckles once she's released from prison if anybody would like to hear that story.

What is a good type of wallet to use if I just want to leave a small amount of 3 or 4 types alone for a year or two. (Say ~$2k or so)

From my understanding part of the benefit of Bitcoin is how open it is. Distributed ledger. Is it easy for people to see which wallets belong to exchanges or other, non-private, owners? 

Also, with future trading on the way, how does that affect transaction accountability? If a large player wanted to manipulate the market could they do so without having all their transactions public? I expect volatility, I'm just trying to assess security.

username#00040,comment,2020-02-28 08:41,,"So not sure how helpful this is but I was an au pair in America just over 10 years ago. My situation was unusual as I was English and knew my host family before working for them. Before I went over I had to meet up with someone to make sure I was suitable for the program, did an interview and a personality test.
The training was in New York, about three days of child care training but also learning about American culture and the culture of the other au pairs.
Almost all of them were German, but there were Finnish, French, Japanese au pairs as well. Most of them were there to learn English. For example one of my au pair friends was Japanese and told me how she’d have better job opportunities at home if she could speak English. Another reason was some were there to find a husband. None of them had affairs with the host dad, if that’s what you’re thinking! One of them ended up with a guy they met on MySpace as he had a thing for Russian looking girls. 
The girls I worked with really loved their kids and the kids loved them. Some were a bit overwhelmed but most families had small families and there was a lot of support for the au pairs. I think what worked with my family was in the first day or so ground rules were set to make sure we were both on the same page. Setting up a routine really helped. Also, let your au pair have some independence. As I said, my circumstances was very different to most au pairs but it’s something I wish more people from the UK would consider doing as it’s a great experience and I loved my time working there.",workingmoms,nationalities

I think in general, basing it on an amount close to what you spent on your own legal fees would at least be better than the current system. Or even having the loser pay the winner's legal fees only if the loser was a bad actor and filed a malicious lawsuit in the first place, like in this example, as deemed by a judge. At least these would be improvements in my opinion.

But anyway, I think you're right that the system I'm in favour of will make people a bit more scared to go to court, but I still think that the benefits probably outweigh the negatives. My system would more importantly make malicious actors and trolls more hesitant to abuse of the court system and threaten or extort money out of innocent people. I've read about so many instances of court abuse like this in America, especially regarding patent trolls. Things like this just don't happen in my country.

Since my SSD does not have a lot of storage space, I had allocated virtual memory on the HDD instead of the SSD to free up some space.

This was all well and good until my HDD seemed to have gotten corrupt suddenly (it just shows up as local drive now but is otherwise inaccessible). Now whenever I try to use the Windows on my SSD with the HDD still connected, Windows is extremely slow and totally unusable. From experimenting I'm convinced this is because it'd be trying to access the virtual memory on the corrupted HDD. It runs so slow that it's impossible for me to disable the virtual memory on the HDD from the control panel settings (the dialogue just becomes unresponsive and it crashes).

If I disconnect the HDD, Windows runs smoothly as if nothing's wrong. The reason I need my HDD connected is that I want to try to recover any files using something like Recuva. But I can't do that because as long as it's connected Windows is unusable. I tried to changed the Sata port hoping Windows would see it as a different drive but it did not.

This on its own shouldn't be a problem as we commonly use appliances from the UK which should work at 230V.

However, whenever the input voltage of the UPS becomes slightly above 250V, it switches to AVR mode and lowers the output voltage to around 215V. When the input voltage goes back down to 250V or less, the UPS switches back to line mode where it doesn't change the voltage value.

I'm also aware this may be more of a personal peeve, but I don't think I'm alone on this one.

I find it bothersome and almost immersion-breaking when I see a mod with improper spelling, grammar, and/or punctuation. It really takes me away from thinking it is part of the game and more as just custom content, despite how high quality the rest of the mod is. I'm not going to give specific names to maintain respect for their work, but there's a fair amount of times I've seen mods that never use upper cases or punctuation.

For example, if a mod added an Actor that was a frightened dog and its name was ""a scared dog"", it would make more sense to name it ""Frightened Dog"". Then the mod might have a dialogue option like ""wheres your owner"" when it makes sense to have ""Where's your owner?"" instead. It just seems like a simple edit to make a mod appear more formal and official that gets overlooked more than expected.

Sorry for the rant, but I don't think it is asking for much to proofread predetermined in-game text. I'm not one to be that guy who corrects everyone's spelling and grammar errors, but when it comes to something that is meant to be formal but instead looks like a text message off my phone, it breaks that atmosphere for me.

username#00061,comment,2021-04-11 06:31,,"OK a lot of DMs. I thought I’d share my learnings here. Basically - why you want to do Kickstarter is to

a) get money coming in before your product's actual launch and during development - bootstrapping basically

b) validating the demand for a product, something you can raise off, or else a less risky way of figuring out if your product has market potential before seriously committing to building.

c) get an audience of super gadget/comic books/niche people who are looking for cool gadgets on board. It can be really good ROAS of up to 10x.

We did it for a mixture of a, b and c. Maybe less b. Though we were quite certain from our own interactions and community feedback that demand for our product was pretty high, we know that validation can increase our valuation in case we wanted to raise. 

Kickstarter.com/projects/bheem/bheemUP is the link by the way.

To be clear, we did OK. Not amazing though. I think there were several problems with our campaign and perhaps some on the part of our ad agencies too. 

Pre campaign - 

You wanna get people hyped up and interested in the product and also get everything just right - photos and videos are important!

Most campaigns find an audience of Kickstarter savvy audiences and then generate leads via Facebook ads/posting into forums (if yours is more of a niche product, that's necessary). Get some PR too. And get them and keep them hyped.

What we did wrong is maybe that we didn't indicate to sign-ups the price of the product, and we didn't send out enough emails which educated them about the product. People will put their email down if they're interested, but a product that's decently high priced ($329 and $399) - even normal marketing will require education of audiences because it's not just an at whim purchase. We also just didn't hype them with the features of the product in the email campaigns. The pre-campaign stuff was managed by an agency, but not one of the big ones. They’re good, but perhaps not for a product like ours which needs more explanation.

Agencies are great but have a think about how they work. If they charge a large fee upfront - they don't have an incentive to put effort in after they get their pay (as in during your campaign). Even if they are taking a percentage, if it doesn't seem to be doing well, they won't put as much effort in. It's your project, and your baby, but they're managing several projects at a time - dozens maybe. It doesn't matter as much to them. If you're not making them money for the time they put in, they won't do things like change your ads if it seems like it's not working. And depending on which agency you choose, they may also restrict your ability to change or work with others too. A good mix of the 2 - a bit upfront + a bit of a fee probably works best. They take between 10 - 35% of your campaign funds (that last figure, I feel, is way too high, and you will not profit if you choose agencies that charge this much). The upfront fees for the big ones are 10 - 25k. But there are definitely good ones which do it for less - pre campaign wise that is. Your best bet - look at the projects live on Kickstarter or IndieGoGo and look for the agency which worked on their project (located at the bottom of the page) and get your idea together, get a bit of traction on your own first, and approach them after you have a bit of traction. They'll give you discounts too.

Some smaller agencies are out there, and there are many courses these days that are good. I don't know which ones are though. 

Some people do the pre-campaign work themselves, without an agency. Know that it's 1 - 5% of email lists that convert IF they're good, Kickstarter aware audiences. Like 10% of emails are opened in large email blasts, and then 1/10 - 1/5 people will click the link. Of those, you wanna have as many people able to use/aware of Kickstarter/Indiegogo as possible to not lose the precious few really interested people who are keen to back your project. You can purchase ""superbacker"" (people who've backed 20+ projects I believe) audiences from various sources. DO NOT EMAIL THEM. You can get your whole campaign banned for that. But you can create Facebook ads and lookalikes based off them. 

The biggest benefit of these large agencies is that they extensive databases of Kickstarter backers, and backer reports of previously successful campaigns that they can retarget. 

These days - a few new things are being used, like creating VIP Facebook groups where people get exclusive access to you and the product - and access to special perks, often for a nominal fee ($1 - 2). These convert really well. Facebook groups in general are great. 

While the campaign is live: 

And then after that - they take on board agencies who manage ads for you for a fee + commission once you're live. You have to have hit your funding goal, and maybe gotten 20 - 100k on your first day to attract their attention. Some companies ONLY do live campaign ads. Some do a fully managed service where they do all your pre campaign marketing, lead generation, page design and a bit of PR - and then manage your ads (they usually take an upfront fee + a commission, and use your money to do it - though some will actually fund your adspend for you too).

You fund the ads most of the time. If your campaign is performing well though - the agency may be able to profit by funding ads on themselves, but will likely take a larger fee for doing so. 

General Kickstarter tips are to put a smaller goal so it looks like you're really smashing it, and make sure you smash it on day 1!

After launch and our first 50-80 or so backers and 30k USD (which we hit on day 1-1.5) we struggled to convert on Facebook ads, even with one of the better advertising agencies. I think the reason for this was because they work by doing surveys to analyse what people want. Our first 50 - 100 backers were largely people we'd had signed up for hospital bed alternative, lifting feature. So they probably gave biased results - people who wanted this for their health needs. Maybe ones not representative of the Kickstarter community. And that may have not primed users to the products cool features and products on the Kickstarter (eg - they just said ""This transforms any bed into an adjustable one,"" as opposed to what they do for other products ""Their unique clamp attaches to any bed frame, and lifts you. It's perfect for you or your parents.""

Our page didn't convert well at all. People were reaching our page but not buying the product - which means our page design sucked, or our product was just not specific/easy enough for Kickstarter audiences to understand. We had the bed incliner, but we also had the sensor mat (the first to detect movements over your entire upper body). That may well have confused a bunch of people in and of itself. Our GIF/product outline didn't emphasise exactly how our bumpstocks help affix BheemUP to any bed frame. We just needed 1 or 2 great pictures of that, or a simple GIF to explain this, and we would have raised quite a lot more, I feel.

But it could have just been the product too - people may buy this for their parents. But they may not see value in sitting up in bed. And Kickstarter purchasers are usually white men between 25 - 45. Sure, some will buy thinking about their parents. But many are looking for innovative, sleekly designed/professional looking gadgets, wearables, and the like.

Other things during the campaign: 

Newsletters - So there are several of these companies which profile your product for a fee (sometimes, they'll approach you and do it for free, or for a commission though if you're tracking well)! Backercamp, BackerCity, Kickstartech etc. They can be quite good - depending on your product. And they often charge $300 - 500 for a blast. Our experiences were that we did generate positive ROAS from them. But after Kickstarter fees, and exclusive discounts you have to offer, it's barely breaking even. It may be wise to organise a bunch of email blasts from these companies at the beginning of your campaign to help you reach day 1 funding though (we hired ours midway through). 

Influencers: We hired a few influencers in our niche. And despite many positive reactions and receptions by the community - we didn't convert many (though we did get a few sales). Again, our page or product explanation may have sucked. We're still live on InDemand - so if you have any feedback, do let us know! 

Overall, our agencies were good in that they helped us accomplish this and we've profited. But we could have done better. 

And we will be back in another campaign for the sensors. We've made a few improvements to that product. And I feel it is definitely more Kickstarter/IndieGoGo-ey (if you purchased/are purchasing a BheemSense Lite package now though, we'll allow you to upgrade for just the extra hardware costs). BheemSense is the first device to detect movement over your entire body, as well as track some vitals, contact free. It also connects to smart home devices. This is perfect for sleep tracking - and it's quite innovative and new so it hopefully will appeal to the crowdfunding audience.

And we're on InDemand now too - which is where you go after your crowdfunding campaign ends. You can continue to generate pre-sales after this, and it could be a good intermediate between crowdfudning and e-commerce. Agencies operate in this space too. You can also get featured on the IndieGoGo newsletter blast. And Indiegogo sometimes actually funds your ads for you if you have a high performing product. Im not 100% sure on this. It may just be better to go to pre-sales on your website and build audiences via Google analytics who are more representative of your market, get you reviews for the long term. But yeah this goes back to the ""reasons why to Kickstarter"" at the top of this post.

 To me being a fan of someone is to respect and to a certain degree want to emulate somebody because you admire them and what they have achieved/what they stand for.

 For me a big part of being British is not taking yourself too seriously and being able to take the piss out of yourself, looking on the bright side in tough circumstances with that underdog spirit and always remaining composed and gracious in defeat. 

 Lewis strikes me more of an American teenager in how he acts. I think he would be monumentally dull to hang out with because he always comes across like he has something to prove  and I find it hard to get excited when he wins. I'm not saying he should change himself or he's a bad person I'm just saying I don't like him and I'm not a fan, and that's totally fair enough.

There aren't many people from Wallonia (the region where Namur is located) compared to Flemish people in this subreddit, so check out /r/Wallonia too.

If you search this subreddit, you'll find that it may be difficult to make friends in Belgium as a foreigner. Don't worry, it's likely not your fault, it's just that Belgians in general are rather closed and mostly keep to themselves. This may be a bit different in Wallonia though, from my experience, people are more likely to talk to strangers over there than in Flanders. However, I would definitely recommend picking up French as quickly as possible, because their English can sometimes be rather lacking (although younger people probably speak English well enough, especially uni students, but I'm not sure).

As for things to do around Namur, check out the Citadel of Namur, and of course, the beautiful nature in all of Wallonia. There are lots of nice hiking trips that you can do there. And of course, try our typical Belgian products: fries, beer, chocolate, and waffles, depending on what you're into.

This is my first time building a pc and i’ve been troubleshooting this for hours so some help would be greatly appreciated.

I have my gpu, cpu+cooler, ram and ssd all plugged into my pc, whenever i switch my psu on, my gpu fans spins and my cpu and psu fan just kind of sputter slowly. The ez-debug led light is flashing red sequentially from right to left and at this point i dont know what to do. I plugged my hdmi cord into my gpu and my monitor said no connection. I’ve triple checked all of my cable connections are in place. Any suggestions?",buildapc,disorders

username#00095,post,2023-01-21 06:58,Coin Farming beyond weekly limit using Unite Squad hopping,"This is an extension/addition to u/aflow3r 's Joke post about farming infinite coins.

The post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonUnite/comments/zar9kv/infinite\_aeos\_coin\_farm/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonUnite/comments/zar9kv/infinite_aeos_coin_farm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

There are many nitty-gritty's about the system I am yet to work out, but I believe I have understood it enough to make it work for anyone reading this. I'll discuss the details after I lay out the potentially infinitely repeatable steps for which you might have clicked on the post for.

# STEPS:

1. Find 2 Unite Squads, let's call them Squad 1 (weekly missions 1A and 1B) and Squad 2 (weekly mission 2A and 2B). It is important that all these missions are unique (will discuss why later).
2. Be in Squad 1 in Tuesday morning when the Weekly Squad missions start, finish the weekly mission ASAP in bot matches.
3. Leave Squad 1 and join Squad 2. You will see you can do the weekly missions again. Do missions 2A and 2B, and leave the squad.
4. This will put you on a 3 hour (180 min) timer and stop you from joining another squad for that period.
5. Wait out the waiting period and re-join Squad 1 and finish 1A and 1B, then leave.
6. Step 4
7. Re-join Squad 2 and finish 2A and 2B, then leave.

&#x200B;

Every time you do the weekly missions of a squad you earn 100 coins and 20 item enhancers. Without spending your entire life on grinding these events and waiting for another 3 hours to do it again, you can do it twice in the morning, once near the middle of the day an once at night and repeat this for 6 days a week, netting you 2400 coins and 480 item enhancers.

If you, however, want to no life this and say fuck you to sleep you maybe able to do it \~45 times a week, netting you 4500 coins and 900 item enhancers (this calculation assumes you can do the missions 45 times in around 9 hours and that you will never sleep.

# HOW DOES IT ACTUALLY WORK? WHAT HAS BEEN FIGURED OUT?

In step 1, I mention that it is necessary to find 2 squads which have a total of 4 unique missions. So you might be led to ask, what happens if 1 or even both of the missions are the same?

Well it doesn't reset. If a certain mission (in say Squad 1) is same as a mission (in Squad 2), that mission won't reset and you won't be able to get its reward. As a result if you leave a squad and rejoin the same squad after waiting for 3 hours, you won't be able to repeat any of the weekly missions and will just waste another 3 hours waiting to join another squad.

\_\_\_

Can you claim the squad rewards more than once using this method?

No, once you claim a certain squad reward in ANY squad, you won't be able to claim that again anywhere else. So if you claim the sticker in Squad 1, even if Squad 2 has a different sticker, you can't claim it.

\_\_\_

Can you be banned for using this 'exploit'?

No Mr. Strawman, I don't believe this is a bannable offence BUT I have only tried this for 5+ days at the moment of making the post, so if I do get banned I'll be sure to update.

\_\_\_

Why can you do it twice in a row on morning 1 but supposedly not anymore on later days?

Now, we have entered the territory of questions I have not figured out with any degree of certainty but I have a few hypothesis. If you try this method out and find something else/ learn more about it, please do share.

So my hypothesis is, the cooldown resets on a new day GMT. I live in India (GMT + 5:30) and so when I finish doing squad events at night, wake up in the morning (much much after 5:30) I can do day 1 morning shenanigans and do Squad Hopping twice in a row. However, I am unsure how much of it is because of daybreak, and how much of it is the time gap between when I left the squad and joined a new one next morning.

One thing I can empirically dismiss is that waiting 6 hours, as opposed to the current 3, allows me to Squad Hop twice in a row. I tried it, it didn't work. But apart from that, your guess is almost as good as mine. (Mine is a bit better due to basically no life-ing this for the duration of this week)

\_\_\_

No, the daily missions do not reset by squad hopping.

\_\_\_

 Can you do it more than \~45 times if you no-life harder?

Now this is speculation as I have not limit tested this aspect as of yet, but I believe you can definitely do it many more times than 45 in a single week, given your absolute dedication to this.

I think that if you get kicked out of a squad, you are not put on a 3 hour timer. I am unaware of the extent of this but I got kicked out of a squad while Squad hopping and I could immediately join another squad, exploiting this, one should be able to do this even a 100 times a week if they wanted to. 

Please don't actually do it 100 times a week, see a doctor/therapist/friends/family if you are even considering it.

However, its a free country (at least where I am) and if you, a consenting adult, choose to do it I can't stop you but I can display the absurdity of your attempt.

STEPS to push further beyond your limit:

1. Make multiple smurfs on Monday and use said smurfs to make Unite Squads, join one with your main.
2. On Tuesday, see which 2 of these squads have a completely different set of weekly missions.
3. Do both missions from your main, use your smurf to kick yourself out.
4. Join the 2nd squad, do mission, kick yourself and repeat.
5. Even with bot matches, certain combinations of missions can take \~30 min to complete.
6. I you want to push beyond the already ridiculous 45 and do it 50 times, you may spend about 25 hours in a week, earning 5000 Aeos coins (which is approx 280 Aeos gems).
7. This puts you far below minimum wage in my country, which is supposedly a 3rd world country.

I claimed to have no-lifed the vanilla method, but even then I did it 5 times a day on average and I usually did play it here and there throughout the day anyway so it didn't hamper my day to day life, but going any further is not recommended. For relaxed folks looking for some extra coins, thrice a day will also  net you 1800 coins and 360 item enhancers a week and even that is a decent enough fuck you to the absurd 2100 weekly coin cap.   

\_\_\_

Now comes the part where I would like to ask for help deciphering how squad missions are decided or at least if I can find out if 2 given squads have different missions without joining.

From my end I joined various squads throughout the week, but only during the latter half, decided to screenshot the missions along with the squad's joining code, hoping to find a link between the squad code and the missions they spawn every week.

It is very possible that this is not a solvable problem and is truly random. But if folks can make uniteapi, I hope that they can find a way of knowing the squad missions prior to joining a squad. I believe u/aflow3r (again) was trying to find out something similar, so if you did manage to figure it out, please do share it with the rest of us.

If people want may small dataset of squad codes and their missions for solving this problem, I will make an imgur album for it but if someone had already figured it out, I won't bother.

Currently on 60mg Vyvanse for ADD and 150 mg Effexor HR for depression.","I'm planning to ask my doc for a sleep study when I see him in about a month. I already have a neurologist to manage my dysautonomia (orthostatic hypotension w/ syncope, now very infrequent episodes, well managed with fluids and added salt; frequent vasovagal near-syncope, not well-managed, triggered mostly by eating; lowish baseline BP). I have a history of PMDD that has been classified as severe. There's no way that's misdiagnosed narcepsy. But as I'm learning more about narcolepsy, I'm wondering if that is either a part of my history of depression and post-partum depression, or maybe the entire underlying root problem. 

Given my history and other issues,  wondering what the game plan might be if I do test positive. I understand modafinil is a common treatment and there seems to be some overlap in effect between that and Vyvanse. I'm guessing maybe they will say to try that instead of Vyvanse for a few days and see how I do? Is there a ramp up time for modafinil? Or does it work right away like ADHD meds do? My rationale for this supposition is that you can come off Vyvanse immediately, but Effexor requires tapering over time, and I think my coming off Effexor would make the docs a lotore nervous given the severity of my depression symptoms and the very clear PMDD presentation.

She was still very functional but after the first day, she refused to leave her apartment.  She also started refusing to eat or drink and wouldn't tell anyone why.

One night I came into her room with her meds and found her sitting in the dark crying.  I sat down and asked her what was wrong and for whatever reason, she opened up to me.

She said that she was aware of her diagnosis, and she hadn't thought much of it until she moved here and started seeing the other people with dementia.  She said they looked like zombies, just sitting and staring all day, and couldn't even feed or toilet themselves.  She said that she didn't want to be like them and lose all her dignity.

I comforted her as best as I could but there really wasn't much that I could say.  I left that job shortly after but I found out later that she continued refusing to eat or drink and it wasn't long before she passed away.

username#00113,comment,2019-06-25 15:45,,"Your reflexes sound fine.

And while reflexes do matter in driving, good observation and defensive driving makes for a much better driver than a reactive driver with shit-hot reflexes.

I think being autistic makes me a better driver, because I am hyper aware.  I know what is going on around me, and I drive as if everyone around me is about to do the stupidest thing possible.  I don’t usually need good reflexes, because I avoid the problems.

The hardest thing about learning to drive for me was learning to control the car well enough that I didn’t have to think about it any more than I think about walking.  Because then the only thing that matters is navigating your path safely, like you do everyday whenever you walk anywhere.

So I suggest have plenty of driving lessons and practice before you attempt your test.  Consider having advanced driving lessons after you have passed your test.  (I did and it helped me a lot).

I’ve been driving for 25 years, have clocked up hundreds of thousands of miles.  Other people comment I’m the safest driver they know and are more comfortable as a passenger with me driving than anyone else. 

Don’t let other people tell you what you can and can’t do.  Believe in yourself, use your strengths to compensate for any deficits.  Your mother is just being protective and overcautious.  You can do more than she gives you credit for.",autism,disorders
username#00113,comment,2019-05-27 05:08,,"It is a widely held view in the autistic community that ABA is abusive.  That is because it is.

Many autistic people who have been subjected to ABA as children developed PTSD and other mental health problems as a result.

It teaches children to hide their pain and that they have no autonomy or agency.  It teaches them they aren’t allowed to say no when someone hurts them.  It makes them especially vulnerable to abuse.

ABA only considers the outward behaviour.  It is compliance training.   It ignores any underlying difficulties.  It does not teach coping strategies or how to manage the difficulties that autistic people face in any meaningful way.  It just teaches us to hide them.

It is worth being aware that the more stress we are under the harder it is to function well.  A normally verbal child may become non-verbal under stress.   And remember that behaviour is communication. 

Non-harmful therapies are ones which seek to identify the difficulties the autistic person is experiencing, and teaching strategies that actually help (a simple example would be: if there is too much noise, put on ear defenders before it becomes too much to bear and triggers a meltdown.  Another example might be teaching alternative communication methods like sign language).  Good therapies will always presume competence, and seek to identify barriers and help navigate those barriers.

I am autistic myself so I apologise if my writing isn’t entirely clear.  I hope it gives you some insight.

I would strongly recommend googling “ABA masterpost” to find a collated list of information on the subject, including posts written by autistic people who have been subjected to ABA, ex-therapists who have spoken up about how abusive it is, and a whole other load of stuff.

Also google Amy Sequenzia.  She is a non-verbal, high care needs autistic adult who is a highly respected activist for the autistic community.  She has a lot to say that makes very worthwhile reading.

I hope this helps.",autism,disorders

Eg) Atreyu or Kelewan are perfectly reasonable and believable fantasy names - removed from the norms of English but not to such an extent that it stretches credibility that the name would have arisen. 

Hapexamendios and Yzordderrex (examples from Clive Barker’s Imajica) on the other hand seem over-contrived.  The characters speak English and their naming conventions dont really support  the letter patterns used in those names.

It's not more of an issue to just say hey I'm (insert preference) than to be upset when you only leave people to make an assumption and they get it wrong.  Personally if I'm in a queer space and I see an opposite gendered couple I assume the most likely scenario, that they are allies.  It's not an insult, and if they simply inform me otherwise then I know.  It doesn't change the way I interact with them.  The simple truth is if you don't tell someone something that you think they should know that's on you.  And it's not just about sexual preference.  I'm Mexican, but most people would look at me and assume I'm white.  I don't get upset when that happens I simply let them know.

username#00121,comment,2024-03-24 15:26,,"Earlier this year, I was I voted to spend several weeks in a Vietnamese village that was so small it never had a name. I was the first Westerner to *ever* visit who wasn't a member of an invading military force. Here are a few tips:

You will need to go to the police station or the local People's Committee office when you arrive. You know how you need to show your passport to the hotel when you check in? You need to do that in small villages, too, as a foreigner. There could be trouble if you don't.

You say ""we"" so I assume your mother is going, too? Or someone fluent in Vietnamese? That will make this go easier. You will find that the young teens speak the best English (they teach it in schools now). Google Translate, using VERY simple words and phrases because it's a shit translator for complicated ideas, will be helpful for when you're on your own.

Expect that everyone who hasn't seen a foreigner will stop to look at you. Expect that the braver ones will come up and may touch you. Expect that everyone knows the word ""hello"" and will shout it at you all the time, hoping for a response. It is super adorable when little kids run up, shout all the English words they know, hug you, and run away. 

Expect to be shocked by a lot of hygiene differences. In homes, Vietnamese people eat out of the same bowls, ""double-dipping,"" refrigerate leftovers less, and you will observe the food chain more closely than you're used to—it's only a few minutes from squawking and running around to simmering in a pot for a lot of animals in the village.

To answer your question: It is very safe. You will not be a victim of crime in a village where everyone knows everyone else's ancestors, unless you don't get out of the way of a 10-year-old on a motorbike who isn't paying attention. You will feel uncomfortable as way too many people pay you way too much attention, but you will be fine. You will sit uncomfortably most of the day while people speak Vietnamese around you and little lots room office you. Bring a phone charger to stay entertained (you don't need a SIM card, just use WiFi.)

Have fun. This will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for everyone .",VietNam,nationalities

I learned the basics, reading music, scales, chords etc. Got fairly advanced enough to play some Chopin though I enjoyed ragtime too. 

Finally came back to piano this year after a couple of decades away. Bought a piano in my house and while I started with learning some new pieces with sheet music, I decided I wanted to learn how to play jazz so hired a local teaching pro and now I'm learning how to read lead sheets and chords and improvising. 

I'm a couple of months in and it's been really fun. My goal is to eventually be able to play with a trio and land some gigs (just for fun, I don't care about making money, just want to play music with people). 

Right now I'm far from competent, especially in soloing. It's not just the notes, it's knowing the little runs and phrases that make it sound good. I do not sound good, but I'm only a couple of months in. 

Anybody out there learn jazz and improv later in life? I have a full time job but can usually play 60 minutes a day or so. And taking lessons once a week.

My friend was a figure skater.  She loved skating and practiced every morning before school.  She didn't want to compete and ended up travelling with a sort of Ice Capades show when she was 17.
Backtrack to our young childhoods.  Her parents beat her and generally treated her badly.  She had a younger brother who no matter how outrageous his actions, could do no wrong.  My friend tried so hard to make her parents happy but couldn't.  
Her mother was 16 when she got pregnant with my friend and 18 when she had her son.
Her mother was quite overbearing.  Her father always thought he was quite funny, but I recall being embarrassed by him a number of times when we were young.
My friend unfortunately was diagnosed with crohn's disease just before she started with Ice Capades and at that time there were few effective medications.  She had a very difficult time while away with the show and attempted to take her own life.  I was away at college at the time and was told she was also diagnosed as bipolar. 
Fast forward a few years and she had met a young man who she would go on to marry.  Her husband's family was Italian and my friend converted to Catholicism and learned to speak Italian.   His parents never accepted her and despite 2 wonderful kids their marriage was not a happy one.
She wanted to leave and take the kids but after trying her husband threatened to take her to court, expose her mental illness, and ruin her.
She reached out to her parents for help, yet they wanted her to stay married and refused.  Because she had been a stay at home mom she had no real money of her own and did not qualify for legal assistance.
She ended up taking her own life at about age 35 and left behind two small kids and a husband.
I was pregnant with my second child at the time and was devastated when she died.
We went to the funeral and a few years later her mother started to contact me and want to spend time with me.  I did so, we went to dinners and I spent time with her kids (who were at that time young teenagers).  
It never sat well with me that she had been abused by her parents and I felt horrible spending time with her mother.  I had this strange near guilt feeling that I should do it, but finally decided that I couldn't any longer.
Because I didn't feel it was my business to go into the abuse she had endured at the hands of her parents, I just let the relationship go with her mother.  I didn't explain,  I just stopped calling.
I suspect her mother wanted to spend time with someone who had been close to her daughter, but I just couldn't bring myself to continue.  It felt fake and wrong.

username#00145,comment,2024-10-17 16:46,,"Negative Communication on the internet is a combination of a few factors:

1. A general feeling that things aren't getting better. Climate change, unemployment, inflation, prospects for retirement, quality of life, potential for conflict, wages etc. When times are good and people are feeling hopeful for the future, their communications reflect that. So raise wages, increase employment, and make it possible for people to not stress over the future.

2. Social Media. Social Media is driven by clicks and views and a lot of the major organizations run on the idea that trouble and anger drive views so many are pushing a narrative that incites anger and makes people afraid of the trouble (real or imagined). 

3. Education. More educated people *generally* tend to review information more critically and fairly. They tend to talk over what they see and either look into the matter more or discuss it to the point of understanding the data.

For pretty much everyone living outside of Quebec, French is of no use or consequence. If we go to Quebec, most people speak English.

Sure, Canada is theoretically bilingual, but no one outside of PQ cares. To me, it is a waste of time and resources. Have us all take a 2nd language, sure, but give options. I have spent more time in Mexico than in Quebec and Spanish would have been WAY more helpful to me.

But to keep ONE SINGLE PROVINCE happy, we have to teach French across the nation. I am sure kids in Vancouver find it useful. Never mind the special set of rules for that one single province.

username#00149,post,2024-01-28 23:03,Brendan Kavanagh (and some of you) are actually the villains of #PianoGate,"&#x200B;

[Change my mind, but don't touch me.](https://preview.redd.it/il5kbqkrh9fc1.jpg?width=577&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=243d55c9d2318692bb94c763b81a6965f70924a0)

\#PianoGate was pretty meh, that over an hour of last week's show was spent talking about a 10-minute minor dispute was really disappointing. What's worse is that the actions of Mr. Kavanagh and reactions of some western netizens aren't getting the proper scrutiny.

So, firstly I'm not a 50-cent'er, or a shill, or a simp. I'm American and can't stand the CCP. It's a cowardly government that lies, steals, bullies, and proportionally is likely the worst government on the planet.

&#x200B;

Summary

This isn't about the CCP, it's about a group of people who just wanted to use the darn piano and film some junk for a show. Brendan Kavanagh intentionally goaded them and is riding this for clicks to his channel. Some people then in turn began acting very inappropriately online and should do a self-evaluation.

The Request

Was the initial request for him to not film them and delete the footage he had wrong or illegal? No, not in any way. You can ask for anything you want in the UK, are you going to get it? Depends on what you're asking for and who you're asking. Kavanagh would've done best as a host nation representative to just inform them of his decision, quickly explain there's no legal protection, and to either finish his set or leave if he was done. Instead, he decided to dig in and rile up some drama.

Mr. Touch

Mr. Touch would've likely never even of factored into any of this had Kavanagh simply said ""No, I won't do that sorry. Goodbye."". Mr. Touch took Kavanagh's bait and acted poorly. If they truly didn't know the local laws, they could've just sought assistance from the police but unfortunately, they let themselves get baited and carried on a dumb argument instead. An argument that Kavanagh started and sustained.

Hearing Zebras

I watch a lot of police interaction videos and based on my experience there's an unfortunately large number of natives who don't have proper knowledge of their own laws. For people to try to make this out like some diabolical attempt at CCP subversion of UK culture is ridiculous. It was a group of people who were ignorant of their environment which isn't very unusual. It's best to be a courteous host, explain it to them, and if they want to just keep on then leave. Repeating the same s\*\*t over and over for 15 minutes is childish.

The Grift

Ever since the video in question blew up, Kavanagh's channel has been 100% dedicated to this dumb argument. He's making rounds on the talking head circuit. This guy is clearly trying to squeeze every drop of exposure out of nothing to prop up what appears to otherwise be some channel where a guy plays piano and sometimes acts like a knob.

The Western 50-center's

Individuals here and elsewhere after the original video went completely into 50-cent mode and started posting about the identities of the people involved like they were hot on the trail of the worst serial killers in modern times. One post was directed at uncovering who the guy with the bowl cut in the background was despite him having 0 involvement in the argument. Someone posted on this sub that they reached out to Mr. Touch's employer disparaging him; what's wrong with you? The guy argued with someone for a few minutes in a public place, how is that a justification for some rando to try and torpedo him? It's ultra-hypocritical to sit here chastising 50-cent attacks on westerners and then turn around behaving in this manner.

Closing

Kavanagh had the high ground, could've just went about his business but decided to Jerry Springer it up. Some people online ate it up and fed the trolling. He and any of those who did are the villains.",ADVChina,nationalities

username#00154,post,2022-12-13 14:29,TIFU by telling my young daughter that she had a feral sister who lived in a cage in the attic.,"Obligatory this happened a few years ago.

My wife travels a lot which means that when my daughter was about 6 or 7 the two of us would have lots of nights together where we would play games or read before bedtime. One time we were sitting on her bed before sleep and about halfway through a book when I closed it and said to her:

""We really love you. I'm so happy it worked out with you. Not like the OTHER one.""

She looked at me, ""What do you mean?""

""Well"", I said, ""Parenting is hard and you don't get much practice so sometimes you make mistakes. Take your sister for instance. Before you we had a  young girl and welllll, it just didn't work out. We were young and didn't know what we were doing and it did NOT go well.""

My daughter just looks at me  and asks, ""What happened to her?""

""Well, we didn't really know what to do with her so we just locked her in a cage in the attic and started over and lucky we did because that's how we got YOU!"" I then opened up the book and started reading as if I hadn't just dropped a bombshell on her.

Now of course my daughter had lots of questions and I just improved facts about her sister, ""Maggie"" that lives in the attic:

* She can't speak English, but kind of grunts and sings like that Jodie Foster movie Nell.
* She is violent and we have to slide her food to her with a stick.
* We've become worried lately about some of her ""drawings"".

You know, fun stuff like that. My daughter knows I'm full of bullshit so she doesn't believe it, but kind of wants to y'know? So we come up with lots of cool stories about her sister who lives in the attic. Sometimes when we read I would stop and look at the ceiling and go ""Shhhhh! Did you hear that? probably nothing."" before going back to the book.

One time she asked what she should do if she ever got out. Now the thing I didn't tell you is that the door to the attic? IT'S IN MY DAUGHTER'S ROOM. LOL.

""Well, I said, If she ever gets out, just lie still under your covers. She's not mad at you, she's mad at Mommy and Daddy.""

So a few weeks later I am working as a lunchroom monitor at her school. This is a volunteer thing you do a few times a month where you walk around the lunch room and help little kids open their milk and stuff. My daughter is at a table with her friends and they call me over. One of the girls, Coleen, asks me straight up, ""Molly says she has a sister who lives in a cage in the attic. Is this true?

Now here is where I F'd up. What I SHOULD have said was, ""No. That's just a story we made up.""

What I SAID was ""I dunnooooo!"" while smiling and shrugging indicating that maybe there is, maybe there isn't a kid being held, hostage.

Didn't think about it.

Few days later I come in from walking the dog and my wife tells me the principal wants me to call her. Oh crap. I know what this is about. My wife is like, ""Oh she probably wants to talk to you about the ice cream fundraiser!"" I'm thinking to myself that no, she does not want me to talk to her about the ice cream fundraiser. lol.

So I call and she says something to the effect of, ""Hi, first, thank you for your help with the ice cream social. So, one of our student's parents called and said that she is worried because, oh this is silly I know, that you are keeping one of your kids in a cage in an attic? That's not true is it?""

So, now I have to go and explain in detail the whole story which sounds like I""m a psychopath and the worst parent ever. She was very good about it and understanding and we nervously laughed it off. The worst part of this was that the girl who said something to her mom was a  young girl whose mom had been to our house and who we had driven places etc. She knew us well and could have just called instead of calling the principal.

The outcome was a good one. We've since become very good friends with the principal and her husband. We celebrate our second daughter's birthday every year on May 10th and we even sign cards from her to people when we send things from the family.

TL;DR I almost had child services all up in my grill because a story I told my daughter about an imaginary sister triggered a call from the school principal after another student told their mom.",tifu,nationalities

So... here's the thing, in the shows, everyone masks, when they come into contact with someone they don't like, they put on a persona, is this not the exact same thing as autist's masking? In the shows, people get overwhelmed by crowds, people find unfamiliar social situations discomforting.

username#00164,post,2019-11-22 21:45,Strange Decision,"Hello, I am 18 years old and I have decided that I will kill myself when I turn 25. I decided this over 2 years ago and I haven't felt any differently during these past 2 years. I know that I have 7 years left but to be honest, I don't think my mind will change.

 I am fairly certain that I don't and haven't ever had depression. There have been time where I felt really happy in the past two years and when I think of my 'deadline' I just think ""Aww, I'm going to miss this. Ah well \*sharp nasal exhale\*"". The funny thing about my decision is that when I'm feeling down, the decision turns into more of a contemplation, like, when I'm sad, I am no longer certain that I want to die.

When I made the decision, I wasn't really sure why, I just decided that the age of 25 seems a nice age to die. I have since given a lot of thought as to why this is. Now, I am pretty sure that these thoughts didn't cross my mind when I decided but thinking about reasons why have just acted as reinforcements to my decision.

&#x200B;

1. I think the biggest reason I have thought of is my Asperger's. I lack the ability to communicate with people very well and I have no 'small talk' ability whatsoever. Because of this, it is very hard for me to make friends. For me to make friends it basically relies on the other person sticking through a very large lack of small talk and awkwardness until I feel comfortable enough to discuss topics that I am knowledgeable and interested in but even at this point most conversations will be very dry. So let's be real, no one would be willing to go through that just for a single friend and I definitely wouldn't expect anyone to, it's just a pain for them. I know one suggestion I see online is to find friends that are similar to me but I won't really be willing to discuss things with people until I know them well and the only easy way you get to know someone is small talk and 2 people with no small talking just wouldn't really work for me.
2. The second reason is basically just a follow on from the first, I won't ever be able to get girlfriend as the main way people decide to start going out or 'dating' is from first impressions from small talk, which I am not at all good at. This is not the way I get interested in somebody, however, I have had very few 'crushes' in my life and the way I've noticed that I got them is, I get to know them until we're friends and then I begin to like them as a 'crush' but this has a problem, I get 'friend zoned' which I don't mind, it's nice to have a friend but this is the second reason I'd never get a girlfriend.
3. The third reason is that at the age of 25, that's when the seriousness of real life starts, i.e. you start saving for a mortgage, most people start their careers, you settle down with someone etcetera. I've always viewed the seriousness of real life as a suffer, I don't personally understand the lure of this part, the main part of life. I am huge believer in non-suffering, no body deserves to suffer.
4. The final reason I had thought about is that I care about the planet and honestly, the best way to nullify or stop the increase of my carbon footprint is to just die, the only extra carbon I'd be adding to the atmosphere would be my decaying body.

So, that is my story, my reasons that I have chosen to die at the age of 25.",SuicideWatch,disorders

https://linktr.ee/RazomForUkraine

Even a few [dollars can do a lot](https://i.imgur.com/83JWsDE.png) in here 

On April, 3 a kind person from Texas made this Diary into an actual book (with formatting and editing). [This is the first 'month' of my story](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/evgeniy-berdnikov/diary-from-kyiv-the-first-30-days/paperback/product-d24qqn.html?page=1&pageSize=4). It is exactly the same as here, so please understand what this is — just another way to gather money and support. Again, this whole thing is about attention and 'on the ground' view, so it will stay free and open here on reddit, but if you want, you can help out by buying this, and all the proceeds will go directly to humanitarian efforts: as of today, over $500 dollars wewre collected from this book sales: we bought armor and supplies for the military, donated to buy a drone, a truck and a thermal visor for the army, plus some minor supplies and food. I don't have a particular 'goal', I spend this money as they come on various things that come along every day.

-------------------------------

People suggest I start writing in my own profile, so here I am. I'm not sure how it's done, so I'll be learning on the go.

So, I guess I'll just start then. My name is Eugene, I'm 32 and I'm just an average guy from Kyiv/Kiev (people are giving me flak for writing Kiev but I speak russian so I'm used to using russian transcription). Writing funny shit is by hobby, so this is a good way for me to get all of this out of my system, and there's a lot of it. If you don't believe, I really don't give a fuck, I can't prove my identtity because privacy and anonimity is still important in the war times. I lived in Kiev my whole life and I'm not going to run now. As a somewhat-proof you can go into my posts and find the post I made a few weeks back about preparing my home to war. 

This won't be about 'news', just my actual experience during the war. I don't know how often I'll be able to update or write comments (can I? I don't know), so I'll try to tag them with the time. Sorry for all the grammatical errors or whatever, I'm trying to type this out as fast as I can between the air sirens.

**25.02.2022 15:55** 

Today is the second day of the invasion, but I'll start back with what happened yesterday. Yesterday at 5:06am we were woken up bu explosions. BAM. BAM. I've never heard a 'real' explosion before but you could tell it's not fireworks. You think maybe it was a car or an accident and maybe you dreamt it all, but then BAM comes closer. And at that moment you realize a full out war has just started. I'm tearing up right now because it was the single most fucking scary moment of my life. I just lay in my bed and the bams are getting closer. Should I run? Where, how? Where's the shelter even? And the biggest fucking terror just makes you unable to move. I was trying to prepare myself for this and stockpiled food and water and supplies, but NOTHING can make you prepared for this. The sheer fucking terror and paralysis of what has come onto your house. I can't explain it and you won't understand. So yo just lay there in the dark and pray to god they don't get THAT close to you. We have a saying 'there are no atheists in the war', well now I know why. I also heard a great expression today ""those who wake up to bombings know how to hate with all their heart"" and unfortunately that is also true.

**25.02.2022 16:00**

Russians are fed propaganda for the last decade that we are the enemy and that we hate them and that our country is full of nationalists and faschists. It was never true until 2014. For those of you who don't know, in 2014 we had a revolution because then-president wanted to tie us to russia and make us forfeit EU integration. People didn't want any of that, so we had a revolution, and he fled, and russians took Crimea and parts of our east regions. Like, actual russian forces invaded us and took our land. I won't lie to you, a lot of easterners and crimeans were happy about it, and I'm not here to judge them, I'm only telling you this so you know one important thing: the war never actually stopped. Every day since 2014 they are shellings in the east and almost every day someone dies. And the worst thing about it is that you get numb to it. Imagine seeing news every day and it says someone died defending your home. Every day. You either get crazy or you phase it out of your head for good. So the war became our new normal. It's a horrible thing, but it's true unfortunately. Thousands of people died. And NOW in 2022 after 8 years of this shit — yes, we do hate russians. They did this to us, came into our home and burned it down and even said we are at fault because we are the bad guys. 

To be honest I was never a patriot. Maybe it's a bad thing to admit but I never felt this connection to people or geography or culture, I speak russian as most of my friends, I did business with russians and through my job I have a lot of friends there. But you need to understand that the moment bombs start flying you get a sudden kick in the groin and an incredible clearness of mind comes down on you. You suddenly realise how tiny and un-important all your problems really are. Debt, weight, car troubles, job and social life issues, it really doesn't *really* matter. You may die today, what are you going to do with your life in this short span of time? So this also clears your mind of all the bullshit and decorum and yesterday I just stopped taking bs and excuses from anyone. 

The weirdest thing yesterday was the influx of russian posts in facebook and even on reddit about how they're sorry. Well you know what? Fuck you and your sorries, this is even worse than thoughts and prayers, this is even worse than people who actually hate us and want us dead just for being Ukrainian. If you're a russian and reading this, fuck you, this is on you. There's 140 million of you, so you either own that 1/140millionth of responsibility, or you shut the fuck up. I admire people who yesterday went on the streets in russian cities, they are heroes and I salute them. You are forever my friend. But those who just bitch on reddit and facebook about how it's not their fault and they didn't vote for putin can collectively go to fucking hell. You had 20 years to get rid of him, but instead you just sit at home sucking his dick that's getting bigger every year. So either you're with him, or you're with the rest of the world. And if you're sorry — be louder, go into the streets, call your deputies,  tell everyone what's really happening. Then we can be friends, but if you're just 'sorry' to me it only means you're trying to get your conscience to shut up. And then I have no pity for you and you're the same as the rest of them and I hope you will experience the terror of waking up to a missile strike. I'm sorry to be this blunt and angry, but I am angry and nothing can change that, my ex wife spent 24 hours in the basement because she is trapped in a small town near an important airfield and the battles are non stop she says. How the fuck is that fair, normal or even remotely not crazy? How am I not supposed to blame THEM? All in all, they were so afraid of 'nationalists' that they created a couple million of them in a day. We always wanted piece, but now? I don't know it's ever possible anymore. There's no winner in this war, already thousands are dead in two days. For what? Fucking hell. 

I'm losing my cool and sorry for the rant, I'll cool down a bit and continue, I hear another strike in the distance.

**25.02.2022 16:30**

Yesterday I was with my mother, the whole day was just panic mode on steroids. Should I go to the store? What do I need to buy? Is it safe? Where's the shelter? Can I trust the news? And I can tell you that time goes real slow when you check the news channels in telegram every minute. It feels like yesterday was weeks ago. And today is already so long I feel line I didn't slept for 3 days but it's just 4pm. 

Most people I know stayed. The whole country was being bombed (winged missile strikes) from belarus and russia and apparently they were targeting military bases, airfield, command points and so on. No one knows how successful it was. So if the whole country is under attack, where are you supposed to go? So people just stayed home. I hear you can come to a recruitment center and get an AK just like that. They say they delivered 10k AKs yesterday and another 8k today (and it's just 4pm mind you), so everyone will fight tooth and nail for every inch of our land. 

Since we are at war for 8 years, we have a big network of shelters. Most aren't actual shelters, but just some basements and underground facilities, so many people went there. I stayed at home and I didn't even have a panic backpack at the time. When you decide that you need to pack your whole life in one backpack, it's tough. You need to be ready in a minute in case of an air siren. A minute - and you're out of the apartment, and maybe you're not coming back. So I was reluctant to doing so, but there really is NOTHING else to do. You read the news and it drives you crazy, your hear explosions outside so you can't geet out, you can't even open the windows to let some fresh air in.

**25.02.2022 17:50**

it's kinda crazy but I can't really 'remember' any particular thing from yesterday. It was an endless barrage of news and blasts outside. They started a land invasion and all over the country there were fights going on. They have air superiority so the only way we can fight is on land when they dig in deeper. Crazy lines to the stores and farmacies and bakeries. Somehow I went to a 'construction' (?) store (like home depot?) and it was empty. I bought duct tape for the windows, trash bags (~~for the russians~~), wipes, candles. Wanted to get a powerbank but don't carry them. Also some extra water. Lines to ATMs (today they don't work anymore I think). What else. Our president surprisingly showed himself as a great stand up guy. Huge respect to him. Lot of talks. Lot of empty promises. Lot of useless 'we are concerned' from UN and Nato, lot's of thoughts and prayers. 

There was a huge fight for one of the important military airfields in Hostomel, 34 ka-52s brought desant (? navy seals? paratroopers?), the videos were quite scary. They shot 3 of them, and the fights went on for hours, there were rumors russia sent 18 IL-76s with more troops to secure it, but our military held it in the end. 

Boris Johnson was the first to do something real with his sanctions of banks and aeroflot, thanks for that. On a related note, sanctions won't work. Well, they will - in a year. But we'll be long gone by then. So I really couldn't care less for sanctions to some deputies, boohoo they won't be able to go to Europe. The only force that can stop russia is their own people, imagine if 20million (1/7 population, it's not even that many) went to the streets? To stop that they'd need an army, and their army is here. Or they'd have to listen. But these long term solutions don't work when we have days if not hours. On another related note, Germany showed their colors: not only they refuse to help us with weapons (i can see that, they have morals and standards, that's kinda okay in a way), but they also oppose SWIFT sanctions. They and Italy. Two countries that have *a lot* of russian money invested in them. It's really disappointing, since both those countries have a lot Ukrainians living and working there. 

In the evening I started duct taping window. A big X and all around the perimeter, in case of shattering. They say most damage to people comes from glass shard, so this might somewhat help. The only dust tape I found was black so my windows now have these grim black X's. I also packed by bag. You can put surprisinly few things in a bag, you know that? Not the tourist ones, but the regular backpacks. Basically some socks, some clothes to change, food, water, documents, id's, meds, towel, money, and that's about it. Your whole life in one tiny backpack. 

We heard rumors that there's gonna be a missile strike at 3am again, and then CNN also reported that, so I set up a clock for 2:55 to get ready. We don't have sirens (air defense) in the district I live, so you need to manually check telegram for messages of air strikes. On one hand it's stupid, but on the other hand it keeps your mind safer.

**25.02.2022 19:20**

It's really scary to go to bed because, well, you know. Any minute a missile attack can come and getting thrown out of sleep isn't pleasant, plus you can't relax, you can shake it off, you can't  just NOT think about it. I got up at 2:55am, woke up my mom and we dressed up and sat there waiting in the dark. for 30 minutes nothing happened so we decided to go to bed, in clothes as we were. Somehow this second night was calmer and I was able to sleep until 8am. My head hurts a little almost all the time because of not having enough sleep and waking up to the smallest sound. Also there's this fucking tram right near my house and it start goign at 6 or so, and when it goes fast the sound is almost like a plane flying by, so I get scared every time I hear it. It's actually surprising how fast I've become afraid of windows and weird sounds. We were told to listen and read about Grads and Smerches to know how they sound and what to do if you hear it. Apparently each artillery has a slightly different sound and time to hit you so there's different ways to hide from it. The more you know!

Another thing was that a lot of people was messaging me. 'How are you?' they said. And it was getting me a bit pissed because how the fuck *am* I? We're in the same country and even in the same city, you know exactly how I am, how everybody else is. And then I saw this picture with the caption ""every 'how are you?' today is an 'I love you' "" and it completely blew my mind, it all came together instantly. People just care. They want to know if we are okay and to be okay. It's such a simple gesture, just a simple how are you, but now it melts my heart. Even my ex wife and ex gf reached out to me to ask if I'm fine, and today is the day you realize nothing really matters THAT MUCH. You have two legs, two arms, working eyes and you're not cold or hungry, what else do you need from life? So I realized I can't be mad or pissed at anyone, and I don't want them to be, too, so I asked them to forgive me for everything and forgave them for everything, because it doesn't matter anymore and from the bottom of my heart I mean it. This unity in Ukraine right now is so real you can feel it in the air and in the streets. No one is going to conquer us, no one is breaking us.

A lot of my friends stayed in the shelters, some even in the subway (in Kharkiv). The pigs are nearing Kharkiv so they started randomly shelling residential areas with Grads (for those who don't know grad (hailstorm) is like 30 missile pack that generally fly in some direction, they aren't precise and just hit whatever). Fucking hell. You probably also heard about the Zmiiniy (Snake island) which is a tragedy but the phrase 'russian ship go fuck yourself' is basically our motto now. Legends.

**25.02.2022 22:35**
The explosions are getting louder and more often so tis is gonna be quick. So nothing happened at night where I live but a missile fell on an apartment building on the other side of Kiev. Looked pretty bad. I even got some sleep today though and woke up at 8. News were good and bad. Ultimately, our army stays strong and kicks russian asses, but today was supposed to be the day they take or encircle Kiev. A few 'sabotage groups' (?), saboteurs were riding around Kiev placing some X marks with fluoruscent paint and we don't know if that is for air strikes or the paratroopers. A few BMD's made it to Kiev and one of them was just randomly driving around one of the districts. The one that crashed a car with a man inside, you've probably seen it. Story (unconfirmed) goes like this: a few people stepped in its way and the driver pulled out an ak and started shooting in the air, and at that moment someone from behind took him out with an asphalt block. Then they kicked his and his co-operator asses and waited for the police to come and get them. Sounds pretty fantastic I know, but in the end we did manage to get that BMD (or BMP I don't know really).

**26.02.2022 14:30**

It was a tough night and I am busy today helping blood banks and volunteers, so I don't have the time to write. Fuckers hit a building with a missile in a middle of Kiev. AA was going crazy at night but somehow I am now not only not scared by it, but actually *glad* when I hear it. It's still fucking loud and scary but each AA strike means one fewer missile or  drone or a plane right? And it's not grads. We've heard grads yesterday and oh boy is it even scarier. Later.

**26.02.2022 17:30**

Busy day, but since it's a diary I'll try to stay in chronological order and tell you about yesterday from the point I left. It's really hard to keep track of the news because literally tens and tens of 'news' are happening every hour. If you want to experience first hand feeds, I suggest you download telegram and subscribe to ukrainian news channels (I won't say which so it doesn't look like propaganda or an ad, basically any ukrainian feed will do). As I said before, you only see biggest, loudest, most 'important' news, but that's like 3% of what's actually happening. Throughout the country every minute come some reports about fights and tank columns being busted or fucking saboteurs doing shit. I just saw a vid where a ukrainian said they promised him 5k usd if he'd arsoned some warehouse. Fucking traitors. Apparently, yesterday was a day of the saboteurs, all over Kiev polive and military were finding and fighting what is called a 'sabotage group', people placing marks for artillery strikes, drone beacons and paratrooper landing zones. So there's been a fucking hunt for them (one small fun titbit from today, Rivne's deputy posted a bounty for invaders, $50 dead, $100 alive. He said they ain't worth more). 

Another weird thing  — you get used to missile strikes and AA blasts. Yeah it's loud and scary but when you know it's *ours* it's even soothing somehow. In the evening there was some *new* noise and later they said it was Grad. Scary thing, it's not like a blast, but rather a quick array of smaller explosions, like a minigun but LOUD. Also scary as hell. There were reports that russians tried to bomb our power plant and everyone was panicking, but later they said everything was fine. Over the night I woke up several times at 2, 3, and 5am from AA blasts, and I realized I dont even register them anymore. Like it's a good thing. Some real sanctions started coming through, some real help, Poland had send us military aid. And that's really all we need.

**26.02.2022 18:35**

TODAY! I actually slept fairly alright today, all things considered, but the window still scares me, I think I'll move to the corridor for the night. At night I've seen my first actual explosion, and also it's been quite close to me. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, and suddenly the room was lighted with a flash(?), and in 2 seconds there was a massive blast. Then again. And so I managed to time it and when I saw another flash, I started shutting my ears with pillows to not hear the blast. 

Also there's this thing about stress. Imagine something sudden and scary, I don't know, like you almost hit someone with a car, or something heavy just dropped in front of you. Your heart beats faster, you lack breath and you're SUPER FOCUSED. Well this is how I am constantly these 2 (now 3) days. When bombs fall, you are focused to listen how far they are. When it's silent it's actually even worse somehow, because it's *too* silent. You know everyone is sitting and waiting and listening, and you don't know where and when the missile will hit. At least when you hear the cannonade you know it's far, but silence is just a pause before another bombing. So you *always* stay hyper focused on your surroundings, especially outside. Is that guy looking suspicious? Maybe he's a saboteur? Is the air clear? What is that noise?

**26.02.2022 19:25**

Stopped mid sentence due to an air strike. Anyway, so about sleep — you are stressed 24/7 and sleep deprived, and when you go to sleep you realize your whole body is shaking and twitching and all of your face muscles are tense. And you can't relax them. You're afraid to go to sleep. But you *need* to sleep at least an hour before the next raid. And thoughts thoughts thoughts. I just can't relax my body for an hour. It's really hard to make yourself un-focus from the moment and stop this survival mode. And every time an explosion occurs, you start over, so over the night you sleep like 3 hours in total in chunks. Head aches constantly and I think we live on adrenalin and cortisol. I also ate like 2 times in the last 2.5 days. We're not even scared about the food shortage since we don't eat! 

Today was the first time I've heard my mom curse. Oh boy did she have a lot to say about russians and putin. She's 55 and I've never seen her like that. 

First day was shock. Second day was apathy. Third day is action. No one is able to just sit and wait anymore, and we're so used to shootings and bombings that you *almost* don't flich anymore. So today I wanted to do something. I called the nearest hospital and asked if they needed blood. They said don't come, we have so many people here that you won't be able to donate til midnight. I called another one and they didn't pick up. I saw a random post in telegram about a woman who's trying to help out military kitchens, so I contacted her and told her we want to help. She told us territorial defense units need help and supplies, so we took a car and drove to the nearest working supermarket and bought food and supplies. They also said they needed a tent to cover the kitchen and food, so my mate gave them his own 3 by 4 meters tent. 

And you can't just donate any food and you can't just 'give it' to them. So we come there and there's hundreds if not thousands of people wanting to join the army and go kill russians, and since there's so many of them the waiting line is hours and even days. They need food and supplies. We found the kitchen and asked where to put our stuff. And armed soldier with an AK took us to the side and told us todrop everything on the ground and show what we have there in the bags. After inspecting everything they took our stuff, and they don't accept cooked food or opened food, only factory-sealed ingredients, I hope I don't need to explain why. So we just gave them the food and decided to check the hospitals. We drove to the one that didn't pick up and when we came there, there was a huge crowd around it, we thought maybe they're military relatives or something, but everyone was there to donate. They had *two* lines at least 200 people each side. I'm writing this and it puts a tear in my eye. Every fucking thing I've seen today showed me how UNITED we are. Every person is a friend and a brother, we give up our stuff for each other and for the military, we share all we have and more. I've never felt so good about being a Ukrainian and living here. When you see it, you realise that no army will conquer us. 3 million people in Kiev and each one of them will fight however they can. We are not afraid. We do not seek 'peace' on their terms. We will fucking burn every russian pig that comes here. You come with a sword, you die from a sword. 

Today's experience was pretty overwhelming. The news from the front are getting better and better. More pics and vids of dead pigs, burnt tanks, destroyed columns. And the people! We've been to the store and the stores are at maximum capacity and also run by volunteers, yet no one steals. There is no panic, no fights over food or whatever. We're in this together. A neighbour came in a few minutes ago to ask if we need anything and we asked if *they* need anything. This is was probably the first time we've talked in years, and yet I felt that she cares and has our backs if something happens.

**26.02.2022 23:45**

The day is almost over. The curfew was set in place from 5pm saturday to 8am monday, so tomorrow my whole day will be spent in my apartment. Since we are volunteering maybe we can get a special ID that would let us drive around, but that's a longshot. 

All in all it feels like the tides are turning. russians still didn't capture any of the big cities. They can't capture or besiege Kiev. We get more and more support every hour. New weapons and AA are supposed to come tomorrow. There are rumors that they are running out of cruise (winged) missiles. Every day we see our army winning. It's a great feeling. We know we can't fail now. It's possible. They wanted to demilitarize Ukraine. Apparently, we are going to demilitarize Russia, lol. 

Tomorrow is also a vote in Belarus to join russia to be like a quasi-ussr, and I think you already know how it will go. BUT the problem is, I have friends in Belarus and if they try to be the third power in this conflict, our army is going to be forced to burn them just like the russian pigs. It's not a great thought. I hope it won't happen. Macron just had a one hour talk with lukashenko trying to convince him to stop, but apparently to no avail. 

If I remember something important from today I'll type it out in the morning, but as of now the second part of the day was 'usual': air strikes, sirens, news news news. Tens of people are writing me on facebook wanting to help with the food and supplies, it's also really amazing how we came together. People offer money, rides, gas, whatever. Have a good night.

**27.02.2022 12:45**

Slept like a fucking baby! Blasts are loud, but you just register them and go back to sleep. Like in a thunderstorm, you know? It's not scary anymore, which is probably a bad thing since fewer and fewer people go to shelters. 

Got some real night sleep for the first time, that was nice. In the morning there was a *new* type of explosion (imagine that, we already know the difference between an AA, a cruise missile, a grad and air attacks, they all sound quite different). It was far so I didn't bother, but my friends showed my pic and vids — something dropped in the next block. Gladly, not directly on the building, just in the middle of the parking, 7 cars blew up. Apparently, AA shot a cruise missile and this was a part of it falling from the sky (but we don't know for sure). 

It's curfew so I can't come out. A friend of mine spent 3 days on the Polish border and still can't get out. It's horrible there, no water, no supplies, no food or shelther. They had to ditch their car and walk 8 hours towards the border because the car line is tens of kilometers (both way, but later on that). She says they found some people in the nearest village who gave them their sofa to sleep (three of them) and charge their phones, and the other night they just spend in a line under the sky. I don't know where she is and how are they, she doesn't reply since yesterday. I feel like it's better here than there. A lot of people realized they can't leave (also men are forbidden to leave and you can't bribe yourself out) so they started to go back, creating another traffic jam for 20 kilometers. And as you can imagine, there is no fuel or gas stations, so cars just stop and people leave them in hopes of getting them back some time later. This friend split with her mom's husband and gave her car to him and he went in some other place since he can't leave the country. So now they're stuck there without a car or a man, two women and a kid.

Over the night nothing really changed. russians still didn't capture ANY of our major cities. Our morale is through the roof, their morale is in the shit. More and more videos emerge of abandoned (not even shot, just abandoned) tanks and vehicles, especially in the east. Kharkiv is right near the border so they hope to get there on their foot. A lot of soldiers surrender. Most of them are fucking kids, 20-22 year olds. Every one of them says the same thing — we didn't know we're going to war, they said it was military excercise, just go and you'll get more orders in three days. They don't have supplies or food, so (IMAGINE THAT) there was even a few videos where russian soliders just went house to house to ask (ask! not demand, not threaten) for food and water and gas. Some started maradeuring stores because they have no food, the logistics chains just aren't there. No food, no gas. tanks can't go that far on one tank of diesel. Oh and since the army took their phones they don't even know what's happening.

Every hour we're closer to victory. As I said, there are no doubts that we're going to win. Yeah they may have long range rockets and planes, but on the ground they're toast. News are great, pigs are burning or surrender. Just know there was news about chechen saboteur group captured, they were riding in a stolen ambulance. In an ambulance. Fucking animals, I don't have words to describe my despise. I was even a bit sad they weren't shot dead. 

Half the Europe closes the sky for Russia, they have nowhere to fly in the west now. Sanctions keep on coming, weapons keep on coming. We're doing this. I don't have much to say about my actual 'life' now because nothing's happening, we sit at home and read the news non stop. Can't go to territorial defense or even donate blood, shops are closed. Nothing much is happening rn. I hear blasts. Some say these are not explosions, but actually shots, as in therre's an artillery battery somewhere in the woods and it shells the motherfuckers whole day long. That's great. I love hearing its blasts, even though THEY'RE FUCKING LOUD it means that every blast is one toast truck or a tank or even a column. The joke for today is that they're throwing hundreds of dead bodies at us so we can't maneuver as good and their blasted tank columns are to block our roads. Let them come. Belarus' fake president lukashenko today confirmed(!) that they were launching missiles from Belarus at us. And that tomorrow or the day after they might join russians in the war. I have a few friends in Belarus so this breaks my heart, I messaged them telling them how it really is for russians here and that if they do get drafted and sent here to just run away and surrender to ours, and I'll try to find a way to help them. It's sad really, we love Belarus people, they fought so hard for their freedom and they lost, but we'll gladly help them overthrow lukashenko and then together we can go on moscow and pee on the kremlin's walls, wouldn't that be great?

**27.02.2022 15:45**

Since this is getting more attention, people started messaging me. If you want me to add something or to tell abour something in particular - ask. Without geographical/military info obviously, it's very strict about sharing any potential strategic info.

Time goes real slow when all you do is check the news constantly and listen for the sirens or explosions. Funny enough, I keep forgetting what day it is. I asked my mom and she doesn't know either. Like... no one cares what day of the week it is, but everyone knows it's the fourth day of the war. Life did get split in half on before and after. 

No one outside, really quiet. Just seen a vid of an old guy going around Bucha (near Kyiv) and cursing the hell out of dead russian and their toasted columb. 4 minutes of him just walking through one street and showing tanks, bmds, trucks. Tens of tanks. They say it was some elite chechen squad with an important chechen general. But the guy who films it goes all out, you can hear the anger and hatred in his words and I totally agree with everything. Some vids just make you cry. Some vids make you angry and wanting vengeance. Two helicopters shot down north of me, that was nice. 

putin just announced they've upped their defcon status for the 'defensive forces' which are actually nuclear forces (nuclear forces? you get what I mean). So it gets a bit scarier I guess but come on? Really? Nukes? I hope if it comes to that his own generals will turn on him. 

Also shitty news from Belarus, more and more news suggest they're about to invade us from the north. Not that we don't have enough  javelins for them, too, but it's really stupid on their side. either lukashenko is indeed crazy or he doesn't get the real info on what's going on here. I have a few good friends there as I mentioned and I don't want them to die.

**27.02.2022 15:50**

Fast small edit but I can't just not post about this. I run a small business so I have clients in messengers, and I needed to ask the territorial defence volunteers if they needed molotow cocktails (since we can't get any food today we try to help any way we can). But I accidentally opened up the wrong chat and typed 'do you need Molotows?' to a client, a middle aged lady. She responded with ""Do *you*?"". 

We're in this together, each and every one of us.

**27.02.2022 18:35**

Since I started volunteering I get a LOT of messages and calls all the time, so I have less and less time to write. Reddit also triies to help (thank you for that, guys), so someone suggest I add links to where you can help and donate. They're at the top of the post, all official and checked, no 'personal' links or whatever, I didn't intend to do this but since the post is getting traction (tracktion? tracsion? whatever) I decided to use it for good. Money won't buy happiness but it will buy food, supplies and javelins to hunt down the russian pigs, so join us! Also, you can always come in Ukraine, get an AK and be a part of an international territorial defence legion. For real. 

Anyway. Day is slow today, but I reall really really get a ton of messages and calls from people all around Kiev wanting to help — food, supplies, money, hands, transport, gas. Doctors call me wanting to help out the army (we have a lot of private clinics but only government hospitals work now). Another friend called and said he has a *barrel* of machine oil if we need it. You know, for equipment or molotows :)  

So I'm slowly becoming sort of a coordinator, even though I barely know anyone and don't have any real contacts, we literally just hopped in the car and decided to go out to the nearest military support 'place' (?) and ask what they need. Today we can't drive due to curfew but tomorrow looks like it's going to be a long day. 

News are great. Winning on all fronts. Fuckers destroyed Mriya :( Google An-225, the biggest airplane in the world, one of a kind. I know it's just a piece of metal, but it was somewhat of a symbol of Ukraine. Mriya means Dream and the fucking pigs destroyed it with an artillery strike. And a lot of people seem to be really sad about it. We'll build a new one from their tanks salvage. 
This reminded me of a joke from a few days back: wanna earn some money fast? Since one russian tank weighs 45 tons, the approximate cost of 1 tank as scrap metal is 360 thousand hryvnias (~12 thousand dollars)!

russia asked for peace talks. Imagine that. To us it means we're winning and that they're exhausted. Fucking losers. EU banned 'russia today' on its territory, and also closed the skies for their planes. Feels good man.

**27.02.2022 20:55**

You know what I'm doing now? Eating ice cream with coffee. And I actually aren't supposed to eat sugar, but... you know. We decided that if the electricity is going to fail, the first thing to go will be frozen stuff in our fridge. So I'm eating ice cream! This reminded me about Remarque — if you never read his books, it's a great time to start. He went through WW1 and wrote several incredible books about war and life after the war. He was coping with severe ptsd and tried to tell the world abou their 'lost generation' of Germans who fought that war. In his books people behave weirdly sometimes, they might spend their last money on oysters and the most expensive champagne they can find. Now I get it. The end of the world is tomorrow (I hope not), so let's dance and enjoy it. So I'm eating ice cream. 

The friend I talked about before managed to cross the border today (fourth day!) to Poland and says it was by luck. She's reunited with her brother and his wife there, all is well. One less thing to worry about. 

People are going nuts over fakes and random reasons to panic. Like you should disable the geolocation in your phone because russian will monitor phones and guide aviation with it. Or like I found a random bag of trash on the street it must be a bomb. Or a friend of a friend of a friend (but he's legit!!!) told me there's goging to be a nuclear strike at night so *go to the shelter*. I'm not even kidding, this last one was just right now. Or someone has that ultraviolet lamp on the balcony (you know, for plants and pot), this is clearly a beacon and you should report them to the police or the plane is gonna come and bomb you. Oh and you definitely should disable gps on your phones! And don't use X messenger or Y messenger. And this last one: mayor of Kiev Klitchko said that we're encircled and no evacuation is possible, it means the end is nigh! He did say almost-that, but out of context it sounds like we're doomed, while in reality today was the most 'silent' day in Kiev and most of the russian retreated back as to not get shelled by artillery. It's hard to fight windmills and I can't even understand if it's coming from actual saboteurs or just stupid people. There's also this type of person who says 'well don't panic BUT...' and sends you the craziest most weird and stupid stuff, and when you say it's bs they respond with 'well I said *don't panic*'.

**27.02.2022 23:45**

I don't know what else to say, most people convinced we're winning but there's like 10% who really panic and spread this uncertainty among the others. Like the government isn't telling us that we're fucked and acsshahuuaallly there's a hundred billion tanks around Kiev. I don't know. Whole day I was pumped and it felt like we're doing it, but now I'm not sure anymore. Morale is everything it seems. 

Tomorrow is going to be a long day — curfew ends so we will drive around helping volunteers and trying to get food and supplies. I'll have to contact all the people who wanted to help and coordinate the meetings with them. 

It's really quiet. For a few hours now. And also there were no air strike sirens for a long time. It's either really good or really bad. A few people reached out to me to thank for the diary and say that this was what made them donate or this is where they found the links, so that makes me really happy. Thank you all. This is how we will win, with your support. We have enough men and willpower, just need some javelins and maybe drones to fuck them over.

>When people donate money, who are they donating to, exactly? Is it you personally? Have you formed any type of corporate entity (LLC or an actual corporation)? Are you a registered charity or a non-profit? What exactly happens to the donations when you receive them?

I don't know how exactly Vit does this, but I can answer why it happens this way. We are in dire need of supplies, every. fucking. day. A person can call me on my cell and say they need a bulletproof vest like TODAY or a package of raincoats for the front line (real examples). Large non-profits can't handle that, they're busy buying Big Stuff like ambulances. Small non-profits still have  bureaucracy and rules to follow, and in situations like we deal with it's unacceptable most of the time. 

So, what do you do? You just believe people and try to do things as fast as possible. A friend of mine calls me and says his comrade  is in town for two days and they *need* a night vision thingy (I don't know what's it's called). I just send the money to them or buy it myself from a guy and give some random dude to deliver it. Most of the charity/humanitarian efforts in Ukraine are like that — word of mouth, trust, believing in people. 

It's a neccessity that comes from the fact that our government can't handle it and big NGO can't react as fast. What if there's a package of helmets that you need to buy by the end of the week? You ask around and people give you the money. Yes I receive money on my personal card and paypal, because it's the fastest way to do it. There is no other way if you need to buy books for refugee kids, boots for a soldier, throw some money towards animal rescue and then buy food for an old lady who's sitter ran away and left her alone in a wheelchair — and all of that can happen in a day and be urgent. I can't attest for all the money I spend because well most of the time I just send them to another card or buy something from a 'dealer' that brings equipment from Poland, so it's really all based on trust. 

Please don't get me wrong, I'm not talking for Vit here, he has a much bigger organization, just wanted to explain why it's done this way. For example, he might need those 6k today, how long do you think a 'real' charity would process that request? With all the receipts and documents involved.

You can't be prepared for that, and you can't explain it. And you can't explain the absolute HATE we have for this scum that comes into our house, rapes our daughters, bombs our children hospitals, rapes and burns children and laughs about it like we're some sort of animals or sub-humans to them. Every day it grows. You only get like 5% of the news of what's really happening on the ground. My ex wife is from Bucha and by the skin of her teeth she managed to escape with some complete strangers who just agreed to take her with them, or she'd be one of those raped corpses on the side of the road. And when you see it.... up close, in reality, it's just beyond any human words to describe, there isn't a word for the power of that feeling of pure hatred and anger. These are the scum hell was invented for, for whom dying one time just shouldn't be enough. And I'm not proud of it, but when I saw those videos I was fucking cheering and I can understand how that happens after what we've seen (and imagine what the soldiers have seen and we didn't). To me it's more strange that when they capture a pilot who was bombing Kharkiv's civilian apartment buildings, they somehow have enough restraint to not kill them on the spot. Or when they captured an artillery operator that was bombing Mariupol and didn't kill him. Scum like that shouldn't be allowed to walk away after he gets traded for our PoWs, but here we are.

it's important that the world sees all of this. The atrocities and the bodies. Don't hide your eyes, look at it, I know it's hard and disgusting, that's the point. We will never forget this. russians should never be forgiven and excused for this. In every country of the world they should be ashamed and afraid to be russians. You may think that russians in Europe/USA are different, but believe me, somehow those who managed to get away from it are the worst, are the biggest supporters of the regime. I've lost friends on Cyprus, in Berlin, in New York. Somehow the farther you are from that shithole the bigger your idealization is, and everyone needs to know this, too. My grandma stopped talking to her best friend in Miami. My friend stopped talking to his aunt and uncle on Cyprus. Another friend narrowly escaped to Germany just to be told that she's a shill and brainwashed. Anyway, my point is simple — there isn't a word to describeour disdain and disgust for them, so we decided that we don't need one, it already exists — *russian*. This word alone should tell you enough and become the worst possible slur. As bad as a russian. 

There are stories that russians in Georgia try to speak English to not be bullied. There are stories that russians in EU pretend to be Ukrainians (!!!) to ride free on busses (oh and it's not like someone said, it was direstly a post from one of the cunts who did this) or just to escape public pressure/blame. Fuck all of them. 


I signed up to be a volunteer in Irpin, one of the three destroyed towns (with Bucha and Hostomel). Bucha still isn't safe, but as Irpin goes in a few days we might start clearing the debris and cleaning the city from... well, everything. I hope they agree to take us, I really need to do this and I want to help. I don't know how it'll go, but we're trying.

A kind person from Texas made this Diary into an actual book (with formatting and editing). [This is the first 'month' of my story](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/evgeniy-berdnikov/diary-from-kyiv-the-first-30-days/paperback/product-d24qqn.html?page=1&pageSize=4). It is exactly the same (minus my shitty grammar) as here, so please understand what this is — just another way to try and gather money and support. Again, this whole thing is about attention and 'on the ground' view forr everyone, so it will forever be free and open, but if you want you can help out by buying this, and all the proceeds will go directly to humanitarian efforts: as of now, we're buying armor (plates and helmets) for our friend in the army and a few other guys. Yes, the state of the army is not great so even regular people chip in to buy equipment. 

I want to say thanks to Patrick who did this and said not to credit him, but we all do what we can and I am grateful.

**05.04.2022 19:55**

Some good news! A few weeks back me and my friend helped a family escape Kiev and got them all transferred to the railway station for an evacuation train. They just sent me a picture of the child the wife gave birth to. They settled down in the west and are now safe and have a baby boy :) A big one as I understand, 4.1 kilos (that's like 9-9.5 pounds for my weird american friends).

**06.04.2022 14:55**

Mayor of Irpin made an announcement today that they called 300 people to come help. There are THOUSANDS of volunteers from all over Ukraine wanting to come over and help, so I don't know if I get 'drafted' to help :( We just sit and wait for now, maybe we'll go to Bucha on the weekend to help install doors into an apartment building that got looted (they went into thousands of apartments to steal everything they could and now every door needs to be reinstalled. Plus the tarnished windows from the explosions and shootings.

Have you seen the dog paws? I won't post links but there's this picture of a ladder behind a house where russians were slaughtering dogs for food. Literally dog paws (all that's left from a dog) screwed to a wooden ladder, and a bad of intestines near it. Whenever you think they can't get any more despicable, they manage to surprise you again. Also they killed the chickens and put their heads on a display on a clothes line.

**06.04.2022 23:55**

Nothing much to tell. Another town next to Bucha is getting a ONE WEEK curfew. Imagine that. It's not even covid-level, it's completely shutting down the town and you can't leave the house for anything (except if there's a siren). A week! Wow. 

Rumors are things may be even worse in Hostomel, Vorzel and Borodyanka (than we've seen in Kharkiv). I've seen aerial view of Borodyanka and it breaks my heart because I basically spent my whole childhood there, every weekend. Also, the pigs brought mobile crematoriums to Mariupol, guess what for. Fuckings animals. 

As of now I didn't get drafted into Irpin :( Waiting for the call.

**07.04.2022 13:55**

90% of dead people found in Bucha have bullet wounds. Not shrapnel from explosions. Bullets. 90% of Buchans killed were executed, that's what it means. 

I just realized that with this 'book' thing I'm now a published author? What a weird timeline. 

No one still called me about the Irpen's volunteering thing, maybe we'll try to go to Bucha on the weekend if it's 'open'. 

Bought several bulletproof vests, searching for helmets. 

[Another great photo day from Meduza](https://meduza.io/feature/2022/04/07/sorok-vtoroy-den-voyny-fotografii). Really gets to me.

Yesterday our government strongly advised people from the east to start evacuating asap. Today one of the evacuating cities (Kramatorsk) was bombed with a missile. Place - railway station, where hundreds of people were trying to board the trains to evacuate. At the moment 30 dead, 100+ injured. Now get this: the tail of the rocket  didn't explode, and it has a white sign on it - За Детей ('For the Children').

**07.04.2022 17:15**

Bit of an unrelated news, but if I understand this correctly, 15 people already bought the 'book'. That's about 15 more than I expected, seriously, I didn't think anyone would care about it. I'm not even sure if anyone still reads me here, let alone gets the paperback, but thank you all. As I said, *all* the money in that account will go to charity.

**08.04.2022 16:12**

I found a cat on street and sat down to pet it. It was nice. Then I went to the post office and another one who lives there (yes my post office is that cool they have a black cat), so I sat down to pet him, too, and he jumped on my knees and started purring. So I'm sitting there in  the middle of the sidewalk with a cat on my lap and don't what to do now. A car stops by and a woman comes out. 'Is this you cat?' she says. 'No'. 'Okay, wait a second', she says and comes around, opens the trunk and gives me a pack of cat food to feed the kitty :) And then just get in the car and drives off. People are so awesome sometimes.  

Always try to pet a cat if you can and it doesn't mind! I try to have a pack of food in my backpack for situations like these but I wasn't wearing one so that woman saved me from sitting there for 30 minutes petting the kitty :)

Sometimes people write me the nicest things and I decided to start sharing them occasionally (with their consent, of course):

""A small tidbit from today. A symphony orchestra near my parents’ house held a benefit concert for Ukraine tonight and my stepmom and I went. There were A TON of people there. All the proceeds went to a group that is actively bringing supplies into Ukraine and transporting people out. A person with the organization got up and spoke and said he’d just gotten back from Poland where he was helping to organize deliveries. When he was done speaking the full orchestra played the national anthem of Ukraine and every person in the room stood up in respect. I don’t think I ever thought I’d see a giant room full of Americans stand like that for another country’s anthem (outside of the Olympics I guess, but this was different). It was a good moment and I teared up a bit and just wanted to share.""

Isn't that just nice? It feels so good to have so much support from around the world. Thank you everyone.

Boris Johnson came today unexpectedly. People from UK told me several times how they despise him, but Boris is our biggest ally and UK did more than any other country, so I'm grateful for that. What's interesting about his visit, is that they took a walk around a few blocks in the center of Kiev, just like that. A few bodyguards, but nothing special. Just two guys walking around the city, and some dude saw them on the sidewalk and started screaming like OMG IT'S BORIS! GREAT BRITAIN FOREVER! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! (in Ukrainian), so they came to him to shake his hand haha. Imagine just having your coffee and Boris Johnson comes around the corner haha. And knowing those places, I can tell you that a walk like that took them at least 30-40 minutes up and down the hills, so it wasn't just a 3 minutes staged photo op. Again, big props to Boris for coming and showing his support.

day 25

Time flies, it's almost a month now, wow. 

Yesterday I realized it's going to take a long long post to explain the whole propaganda thing, so I thought about it and I'll try to make it shorter. Basically, since 2004 we were shown in russian media like these USA puppets (because who wouldn't want to be like russia and with russia?) and slowly they started ramping up this idea that we are some kind of nationalists that try to purge and destroy everything russia-related, people included. This was the premise of 2014's invasion. This was why so many people supported it. But get this, half the population of Donetsk and Lugansk areas (the ones that were invaded) left and went *west* into Ukraine, not towards russia. I know a lot of people who fled Donetsk in 2014, and even some from Crimea. This is just to explain how things actually were — at least half people didn't want the russian world and the ones that stayed are living worse now than they did 8 years ago. But in the russian media (even though the active war ended 7 years ago) we are still bombing Donetsk every week or so. So since 2014 there was this new narrative — we are killing our own citizens because they're russians and we're destroying our own cities out os spite. 

Funny thing is, it got more crazier over the years, we steal organs and burn children and use gas on prisoners, whatever you can think of. Now get this, before the war you could go on any huge russian state media website and every day there would be some news about Ukraine. Like... why? There were constant articles and even talk shows about Ukraine. We out here don't talk about russia and we don't care what's happening there, but they still talk about us daily, like a bitter loser ex. Ukraine this and Ukraine that, which makes me believe they either were preparing this invasion since 2014 or just needed this common enemy to hate (USA is too far away to be scared of). And as stupid as this sounds, this is possible due to the way people were taught in USSR: if something is in the paper, it is true. If something is said on the tv, it is true. Always. People were held and raised with high moral standards, so they believed the news and the official party faces. 

My grandma is like this, and this is why we need to  calm her every day — she sees all sorts of crazy rumors on tv and believes them. Now, older people is *the* backbone of russian support for putin, so they just eat this stuff with a showel. I have relatives in russia and in cyprus and they watch russian and you wouldn't believe the crazy things they *just know for sure* are happening here. It's either famine, genocide, experiments on people or just hangings in the streets for speaking russian (kind reminder that I speak russian). And it's impossible to argue with them, so a lot of families just split over this shit. 

This is why russians really believe they have no casualties. This is why they believe we are making nuclear weapons. This is why they believe we train pigeons to carry deadly pathogens that will only affect and kill russian dna. This is why every child hospital can be a military hideout and must be destroyed. Imagine that for the last 20 years you've been told in every single outlet, show and paper that your neighbors hate you. It will get to you, don't think you're smarter than that. If the media bombardment is long enough and takes most of your attention, in time this becomes a reality. This is how advertisement works, by the way, it's not about 'buy this now!', but rather to plant a seed in your mind that will stay there until the time is right. Well, this was their time. 20 years is a long time, two generations are brought up on these lies, and they never knew different, so they believe it. Their parents know it's true and the tv says it's true, and you're not that interested to research any further. This is how a nation-wide hatred towards my country was being grown. They were patient, and it went well. Now we see the end of that rope, 71% of russians (86% by *adjusted* data) support this war. They don't even call it a war. They believe this is just and that we, a small country with 1/4 of their population and no nukes/army wanted to invade *them*.

**20.03.2022 19:45**

The other thing is their military and their 'pride'. Do you know what's the biggest holiday in russia? The Victory Day on 9th oh may. 80 years have passed but they still cling to this as their greatest achievement. And don't get we wrong, it was indeed a feat, and by the way percentage wise Ukrainian and Belarusians lost the most people and most combats were on Ukrainian land, so it's not like we don't respect that. But they put it in overdrive and basically jerk around it like never before. Today it's bigger than it was 10 or 20 years ago, how so? Well, when you have nothing to be proud about today, have no real prospects in the future, what else do you have left? The past. You know those losers who peaked in school and 20 years later think of it as the best times of their life? Well that, but it's a country. russians are poor, I've seen the stats a few days back that only 20% of russians have an international passport (a document that lets you travel abroad). As a country they don't have anything to be proud about, no technologies, no tourism, no production. There's nothing except for gas and oil, realistically speaking. So they have this 'pride' about WW2 because that's all they had in the last 80 years. By the way, they still paint 'on berlin!' on their tanks, cars and weapons. A few days back we hit a heli that had a mark like that on some parade before. There's also this notion of 'we can do it again' implying that if shit goes down they'll gladly go to war with Germany. 

This whole WW2 circlejerk poured into military. They have children's summer camp in military styles, 'war disneyland' park, they even have a fucking [miliary cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Cathedral_of_the_Russian_Armed_Forces), just LOOK AT THAT THING, something straight out of Red Alert. And yes, there are murals and frescoes of putin inside. The military parade each year is like the most important thing ever and even when they had covid, they still held it just a few weeks later. They also have a special TV channel that's just about war and army, and some youtube channels of the same type. It's a huge propaganda machine to make russians (and the whole world?) believe that they have some incredible military strength. Well, you all now how it went in real life. Most of their technology are what's left behind from the soviet era, and the new stuff is basically modernized soviet tech. Don't get me wrong, that stuff is good enough and we also use it, but they think of themselves like the second best army in the world and their catapults don't work because they're 30 years old. So they have this huge and scary army that never had any real combat, fighting methods and tech from the 80s at least, and most importantly — corruption.

 Ah, that sweet sweet corruption. It's a national idea, really. In Ukraine too, and we had our share of fucked up corruption with the military, but still we knew that this day would come so we only stole *some* of the money, while russians apparently did steal most of it. Their soldiers have supplies from USSR (no joke, I've seen the disassembly of their first aid kit), old AKs, shitty boots and uniform. I never paid close attention to that until I've heard some of the PoWs talking about how our soldiers were equipped like cyborgs or astronauts, lol. Anyway, the military strength goes like this: you have 5000 tanks, a quarter of them are just rusted junk, another quarter probably doesn't have any cumulative armor because it was stolen / sold on the side or never installed in the first place. So you have 2500 tanks out for which you can't even have enough operators and engineers. Also, a third of those suddenly break on their way to city X and can't be repaired on the spot. And you don't even have enough diesel and machine oil (and they eat A LOT of both since they're old) to support them. And it goes the same for every type of military and weaponry, we had the exact same issue in 2014 and that's why we lost so badly back then. This whole thing makes me think that they might not even have 'working' nuclear missiles. I'm sure some of them are junk, some of the silos are stuck with rust, some of them were stolen and sold to China or NK. Generals and high ranking officials are also all corrupt and *very* rich, so you need to wonder where they got their money from. And by the way, sudden 'fires' on military warehouses is somehow a normal thing (in Ukraine, too). Like those exact warehouses that were supposed to store a lot of important and expensive stuff suddenly go boom in the middle of the night and no one knows why. So their efforts in the actual army/ground/air advancements are futile, there's only pride and no real meat. All they can do now is bomb us, unfortunately.

I made a post a [few weeks back](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/sbmt6d/how_to_prepare_your_house_for_an_active_wartime/) and people suggested I go here. 

So PLEASE could someone make a post detailing what do you think is a good kit / strategy for us now. How to stay safe at home or if we have to run. Anything that can help. 

I was reading answers to my post and working on it, but in the end I woke up today to missile strikes at 5am and nothing can prepare you for this. So please, again, if there are people who've been in situations like this, help me and every other Ukrainian who might come here. 

THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS so I hope this will stay up, I just want help from the community on survival and prepping my home for anything that may come. thank you

edit: okay guys I get it it's not prepping if it's already started, i'll try to be clearer next time I wake up from a fucking missile strike. Could you please still help us as much as you may? Thanks. I'm trying to stack up on needed stuff.",preppers,nationalities

If it gets relatively bad, we may be cut from electricity, water, heat supplies, so how do I prepare for that? Is there some survival lists/kits to look into? Like obviously we'll need water, canned food, maybe some way to start a fire inside if it gets to that, some way to cook (gas camping stove?), but what else? 

A place for excrements in case of plumbing issues, some medication? I have no idea how can one prepare to live in a war zone, and I don't want to panic but I'd rather be ready for at least *something* than just sit here and wait for what's to come.

Thanks. I wish you all a peaceful sky above your heads.

oh and by the way, is there something to do with the apartment itself? I don't know maybe like some sheets or platic over windows etc

edit: oh wow so many great replies, some people even offered me shelter in their country, this community can be so incredible. Thank you all. I hope it won't come to that.

There's so many comments, I'm sorry I can't reply to all of you, but thank you, I will try and do my best.

It's over a thousand replies now so I'm sorry again if I missed anything, but if you want to ask/know something, just DM me and I'll try to answer. 

TL;DR: I live in Kyiv. People are split, but no one really wants to aknowledge the fact that we might be on the brink of war with (the better word would probably be 'destruction by') russia. Like, what's the point in talking about it? So we don't. Government just issued a leaflet about what to have in your medkit and how to behace in case of artillery strikes, so there's that. News are bleak, you don't know what to believe, maybe it's propaganda, maybe it's the boy who cried 'wolf', maybe it's a distraction. Fireworks went out yesterday (which are by the way illegal due to veterans with PTSD from war) and I was scared it was a strike. I'm prone to anxiety so maybe I'm not the most objective spectator, but it's fucking hard. You either read the news and realize it gets worse and worse, or you stick your head into the sand and wish it would all go away. Something like this happened before, but never on this scale, they're spending a lot of effort and money bringing all these troops (over 100k) and vehicles (they even had 90 trains with tanks in Belarus out of a sudden) and ships around us. And since the west didn't blink, either putin's bluffing or doesn't care. Fuck.

EDIT on 24th of Feb since people keep messaging me. It happened. Nothing can prepare you to waking up at 5 am from explosions, it was the single most scary experience of my life.

Ref: https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/aug/31/job-requirement-creep-has-reached-a-ridiculous/

It’s the idea that minimum requirements for jobs keeps inching forward, sometimes with no reasonable justification.

For example, where I live in Canada you need to have a 4-year degree now to become a police officer. You also need one to become a conservation officer. In my parent’s generation you just needed a high school diploma and a bit of life experience. 

What you’re discussing is also where the exploitation of people through unpaid internships comes in. A woman I know had to work for 4-years in unpaid internships before she could land a job in her industry. That means for NEARLY HALF A DECADE her only idea of career progression was from moving from one prestigious unpaid job to a more prestigious firm’s unpaid job. 

If you go back far enough you’ll see that chartered accountants did less to reach their positions as well as lawyers, who at one point only required undergraduate degrees. 

HR Managers and Organizational Behaviour specialists have long determined that experience is a better predictor of success than education however. If they constantly listed positions and never had bites, they’d have to lower their target criteria but if they keep finding qualified, experienced candidates then there’s no reason for them to back down from those demands.",NoStupidQuestions,nationalities

  G-Man is moving with a story. He gave crystals to Black Mesa. Without him, the story wouldn't be as good as we wanted/got. He launched a nuke. Without him, there wouldn't be any Combines, any 7 Hour War, any rebells, any Half-Life 2. You wanted a good story? G-Man moved it that way. 

  In the end of Half-Life *spoilers*, he offers you a job. If you decline the offer, he'll send you to death. You/player would do the same thing, because you want to play with someone, who wants it. If you accept the offer, he'll ,,store"" you into the backround of this whole story.Again, you/player would do the same thing. You just want to see yourself/Gordon in next part of the story/next game.
  
  I'm non-English speaker, I'm from Czech Republic. So I hope you understand my theory, if yes, what is your opinion on this? 
  I've always wanted to write something on an Internet in English language, but I was sooo worried about fu**ing something up. Was I good?

Does that mean I can't distinguish good literature from bad literature?,"I often hear people say ""I didn't like this XYZ book"" or ""I am more into this XY genre"" or ""I just couldn't complete this book"". The problem with me is that I like every book I read. And I like every genre I have ever read. Its not like I have read many books (approx. 200 books till now) cause I am still in 12th grade. But till now, I havn't actually read a book that I hated or couldn't finish. 

I liked Twilight Saga, HP, LOTR, ASOIAF. I enjoyed every Dan Brown book (even Inferno). Completed whole Sherlock Holmes collection 3 times. I have read books by Doestovysky, Dickens, Shakespeare and many other Classics and was impressed by all of them. I love war books and horror books. When I started reading, I completed the whole Famous Five series, many Hardy Boys books and I  loved every single one of them. I have also read books by Bill Bryson, Yuval Noah Harari, and all kinds of Non-fiction. 

My point is that I can't distinguish good writing from bad writing. When I first read Twilight, Dan Brown, etc. I thought that the writing is excellent. Untill I got to reading reviews and stuff.

Does this mean I need to develop some kind of critical thinking or something? Or is it because English is not my native language?",books,"disorders, nationalities"

After knowing them a few months, I guess they realized how eager I am to be of help and also how weak I am to bullying, because it literally turned into me being a free labor service. Either of these guys would text me and ask me to fix their car, wire a house they're building, hang a TV on the wall, etc. Then, they never do anything at all in return. I would drop whatever was going on in my own life whenever they texted me wanting me to work. I'm good with handy stuff so my ""friends"" must've realized they could exploit that. I've never been offered pay or anything. I've literally spent the afternoon under this one guy's car, then when I text him asking to hang out he says he's too busy, literally every day, and won't even go for a drive with me or anything, and certainly not help me with stuff in my life. I feel like the friendships have turned totally toxic. I got a text from one of these ""friends"" today and he said he wanted me to install a new sound system in his car (which is something he knows I know how to do).

I'm at the point in my life where I'd really like to get into a relationship but the main issue is I have autism.

After getting to know me, people may notice some quirks and likely a bit of social awkwardness. It's not that my autism would prevent me from being a good boyfriend, but it has brought up a moral dilemma for me. In the case of my friends, I actually haven't told them that I'm different in any way, but I don't feel like there is anything wrong with that. In a serious relationship however, I think it would definitely be wrong to hide something like this, and if I were to finally be open about my issue it could cause a sudden breakup (because of hiding something for so long). I'm the kind of person who would never lie and I always like to be honest and upfront about any issues.

If we only pulled out head out of our asses and legalized cannabis it would deal a huge blow to the gangs, and we would immediately see a huge improvement on the streets. They would still do their fraud, and sell heavier drugs, but the first does not require people to shoot each other in the streets and the second has such a smaller market. 

There is no party that is for legalising it, and nobody is even suggesting it outer than a few youth associations for the parliament parties, such as the right-wing liberals. 

I hate how our parties are huge idiots on this, because the solution to reduce a looooot of our problems on the streets is right there in the open, but they refuse to acknowledge it because cannabis is a demon drug that ruins leverh life it touches. ",rant,nationalities
username#00188,post,2024-05-18 15:28,"Why do some languges have genders on nouns, but where there is no clear rule showing what gender a word belongs to?","Languages like Spanish is often simple to figure out the gender of a noun. Masculine ends with o, and feminine ends with a. There are exceptions like ""El tema"", but in general it's very straight forward.

Then we have languages like German, Swedish and Norwegian there there are no clear rules, at least from the outside. You can't go by how the root word is spelt, and you just have to ""know"" what is right.

What is the point of genders in these languages? Or rather, why are they set up in such a way that there are no clear way of knowing what noun belongs to what gender, like in the romance languages?

I'm Swedish, and whenever a friend from outside asks WHY a noun begins with ett/en (the equivalent to a/an in English), I just shrug and say ""I have no idea, it's just the way it is and sounds the most correct to us"".",language,nationalities

Not slow as in stupid, but I like to think before I speak, and I'm very calm in general and don't zoom around the room and in 5 seconds I've already done 10 different things.

I feel like this has been a detriment on first dates, and that the dates find me boring, or something. One example during dates is that I can show some interest in them, ask some question and then maybe I can take like 10 seconds just to process their response.

If we go bowling and I get a strike, I don't start jumping around and scream in excitement. I tend to just make a small acknowledging nod, a bit like Teal'c does if you have seen Stargate. Same if my date gets one, and I also say a normal-voiced ""good job"".

It's just really my personality. It's not that I'm tired. Not sure if it's related to my Asperger's syndrome. Maybe the part of thinking and processing is but not really sure.

Is this as much of a detriment as I'm worried it is, or is it just in my head? Do women in general not have anything against slower, not so zoom-zoom, people? Everyone is different of course, but in general? ",dating_advice,disorders

What I'm curious about is how common Catalan, or Mallorquin, actually is on the island? I have only heard it in real life twice I think, when my father's friend passed away and we were at his funeral, and some rsndom couple at a café. 

Other than that, I only really hear it from the bus announcer, and see it in text naturally. 

Whenever people approach me and my father they always start in english or castellano. I guess I kind of look non-spanish, but my father could be taken for a Spanish person. This happens across the entire island, from Palma to Andratx, to  Deia, to Cala Figuera and Formentor.

username#00188,post,2024-04-12 16:13,"Am I wrong for saying I would be happy if my best friend's son, my god son, would end up with Asperger's?","Had a small... wouldn't call it a fight, but a disagreement with my best friend (35F) this week I (34M) want some input on.

She has an almost 3 year old kid, and he's awesome. I am also his god father, which doesn't really mean anything other than a fancy title and it being an honor. I also have Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism, that is nowadays baked into the autism spectrum disorder. However, those of us who got our diagnosis before the update to DSM-V got to keep our own diagnosis so I still officially have Asperger's and not Autism.

Anyway, I was visiting my friend and playing around with her kid. Then as he had been put to bed we just sat around and talked a bit. She talked about some worries she had, in that that as her boyfriend (50M) is older, she is slightly worried as she saw that autism is a bit more common if the father is old.

I basically told her ""I would love for him to have it as well, then we have one more thing to bond over I could teach him all about that aspie life :D"". She didn't get mad, but you could see that she wasn't too happy with that response, as she said ""I hope not..."" and switched subject.

Am I wrong for saying it? I love my Asperger's. I feel like it has improved my life in many things, such as my attention to detail, being able to hyperfocus and not feeling the same kind of pressure to ""fit in"" with the rest of society, such as in terms of fashion and instead just wearing what I find comfortable without being afraid of what other people think etc etc. I really don't feel like it's a detriment to my life, so why should I not be happy if he also ends up autism, as long as it's on ""level 1"", as it's called nowadays, which would be the mildest case.

I really don't see my Asperger's as a handicap, or something affecting my life in a negative way, but was it wrong to tell her I wouldn't mind if he also had it?",amiwrong,disorders

Maybe there's no trigger really.. or maybe no one can identify it.. some diseases are just like that.. they're called (idiopathic) like idiopathic hypertension or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis... That happens and we don't know why or how... idiopathic depressive disorder exists as well.. 

You said it was diagnosed so I presume you already saw a professional...
Please keep seeing him/her and make sure to follow any prescription they have given you... Sometimes it's not important to know why or how (like in idiopathic hypertension) but it is important to remain under  treatment to avoid fatal consequences...

If you feel like it you can change the professional that's perfectly okay especially if it makes you feel better...

1. Keep it down low with the party, but take time to make connections (not just for your social life, but it can open opportunities down the line).  

2.When possible take the time to learn things outside of your field to enrich yourself. It might even give you an edge over your competitor. For example, an engineering degree with project management certification is definitely better than just the engineering degree alone.

3. Try to get good GPA as it'll mean you get to go first when picking classes. Later in senior years, the seats for senior classes are very limited.The American college system is designed to keep you there if you start falling behind, the longer you stay the more money you spend. 

4. Unless it's really necessary, for the love of whatever GOD you pray to, don't take early morning classes.

5. Also, whenever possible, buy textbook secondhand.

6. Learn how to do citation, and how to use skeleton structure in writing.

7. Everyone have different ways to go about life and there's never and exact singular path to do well in life.

username#00196,post,2021-09-09 14:20,Some questions for those of you with a few knots under your belt...,"Sorry about the small novel below, I have been compiling these notes for quite some time, and I thought this would be a great place to get some feedback from those of you who have been doing this for a while.


Before getting started, I should say that I am currently 48, and I am aiming to retire sometime around 55 or 56. Previously, I had this mindset of “I do not want to be working past 62 1/2”, though because of just how well my investment accounts have been performing, I have started to think more and more about retiring once I hit my financial target as opposed to a particular age. I would like to do this while I am still relatively young and still in good physical shape.

That being said, I know that I cannot really touch my retirement funds (without hefty fines) until 59 or 62, depending on certain factors. With that I have two options… I can come up with a disciplined three-year or four-year as much as humanly possible, then save as much cash as humanly possible. Or, another option would be to find some way to monetize my adventures, perhaps something as simple as creating a new YouTube channel called *“pdmcmahon’s Adventures as a Brand New Sailor”*, and then documenting all of my learning experiences and my adventures.

I have had the itch to retire on a boat for three to four few years now. I get maybe 85% of my content from YouTube, thanks to the almost 200 channels to which I am subscribed. With the amount of data I am sending them, YouTube has done a very good job at recommending content which I quite often watch. Then about 18 months ago, YouTube suggested a video from a channel called Exploring Alternatives, it was [a family of a husband and wife, and their young daughter](https://youtu.be/lk83N2u1ZmY). The husband bought his boat over ten years prior with the goal of taking an 18-month journey from Seattle to New Zealand. It was never meant to become a long-term thing, though fast-forward a decade and here they are.  They filmed some videos on things like how they have improved the electrical system, they created blueprints for it all, the whole ball of wax. I am a sucker for proper documentation, so that part in particular really struck with me.

Link to the video in case it didn’t work above: [https://youtu.be/lk83N2u1ZmY](https://youtu.be/lk83N2u1ZmY)

Link to their YouTube channel (strongly recommend subscribing): [https://www.youtube.com/c/svdelos](https://www.youtube.com/c/svdelos)

The aforementioned playlist where they cover a variety of maintenance items: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQp8FoQ4t-lUAHfipxG8pVDb3LVHaoCNo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQp8FoQ4t-lUAHfipxG8pVDb3LVHaoCNo) 

I am aiming for something in the 50-55 foot range. I am already something of a minimalist, so I should be fine with selling or donating as many of my personal items as possible. My only debt is my house and my car. Ideally, my car will be paid off in 18-24 months, if not sooner. I then just need to take good care of it so it lasts me until retirement.  

In the meantime, I obviously have plenty I can be doing. I have purchased some books, and I have started researching some sailing courses. I am trying to think of a better use of vacation time than heading out to the coast and spend two or three days sailing and learning.

Some of the financial aspects I am not even taking into mind are things like any equity I am able to take from the house when I sell it, or any potential inheritance from my folks. I am grateful they are both still with us, and they recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary, though I know it is important to be realistic. As much as I would like to just pay for a boat cash and not deal with a mortgage, my money would work better for me if I simply left as much in my investment accounts as possible as the gains there would far outweigh any potential savings I might enjoy buy paying for a boat outright.

Anyway, my apologies if the intro was a little long, I was hoping it could help provide some context.

Below are some of the questions and thoughts which I have been jotting down at random points over the last few years.

If you are responding to a particular question, would you be so kind as to add a number so I know which question you are referencing?



Above all else, thank you all ***very much*** for your time.




**QUESTIONS:**


1. When did you last perform a haul-out to sand and/or paint?
2. Is the hull fiberglass, cast iron, aluminum?
3. What major components have been recently replaced?
4. When did you last replace the on-board batteries?
5. What is the state of the on-board appliances?
6. Is the stove and/or oven on a gimbal system to prevent spillage?
7. Does the stove(oven) swing forward-aft or port-starboard?
8. Aside from the outside grill, are all of the appliances induction do any of them run of propane or natural gas? Or, are there outdoor grills which use something similar to induction so I can avoid having to stay stocked up on propane? 
   1. *(Induction ovens are propane-free and more energy-efficient)*
   2. *(II there is not already an outside grill, visual where one could be mounted)*
9. What are I’m the onboard electric options? 12V? 24V, 220V?
   1. *(This will depend on the country of manufacturing)*
10. What is the one thing you wish this boat had but didn’t? If so, is it something which can be added relatively easily?
11. Does the boat contain a water desalination plant for turning sea water into fresh water?
12. Does the boat contain a hot water heater?
13. Does the boat contain a washer-dryer combo? If not, can one be retrofitted into a particular space?
14. This may be a stretch, but does the boat contain a reverse-osmosis system or perhaps even a water softener?
15. What sort of options were available on this particular board when it was new?




**TO RESEARCH:**



1. Try to stick to boats which only have (drop-down) bow thrusters for easier navigation
2. Research cost-benefit of solar panels and wind generators with regards to recharging batteries
3. Check into costs of gimbal satellite internet
4. *On that note, write up some best practices on how to be efficient and responsible with limited bandwidth.* *This includes even the little things like removing iOS iPas OS apps which you will definitely not need or use to avoid the bandwidth they use when pulling down app updates.* *You can also reduce bandwidth through some of the settings in the Apple T*V
5. Use your existing Eero three-pack for WiFi on the boat
6. Find a way to use your existing 2018 Mac Mini headless with an [HDMI emulator](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FLZXGJ6) for 1080p over Screen Sharing
7. Then, use your existing 2019 16” MacBook Pro as your main workstation. 
8. What is the purpose of the boot stripe? Is is merely cosmetic? Does it show where your waterline should be located if the boat is properly balanced?
9. [https://www.bottompaintstore.com/blog/topside-paint-how-to/how-to-paint-a-boot-stripe](https://www.bottompaintstore.com/blog/topside-paint-how-to/how-to-paint-a-boot-stripe)  
10. Ditch Kit, what needs to be in it, how often should certain components be inspected and/or cycled out?




**TO BUY:**


1. Label Maker
2. Multimeter
3. EPIRB
4. Fire Extinguishers x3 (ensure you have quarterly reminders to check their pressure and annual reminders to cycle them out) 
5. Tools
6. Document the tools and maintenance supplies which you don’t yet know you will need. For example:
7. Solder Gun
8. Thermometer Gun (look for both touchless forehead thermometers as well as infrared thermometers)
9. Cordless Drill
10. Corded Drills *(factor in boat voltage)*
11. Permanently Mounted USB Charging Hubs *(including USC-C chargers)*




**SAILING CLASSES LOCATIONS:**


1. Fort Lauderdale, Florida
2. Hilton Head, South Carolina
3. Folly Beach, South Carolina
4. Charleston, South Carolina



**BOOKS:**


1. The Sailor’s Guide to Small Cruising Sailboats ([https://amzn.com/0071636528](https://amzn.com/0071636528))



**RANDOM:**


A quote which has truly inspired me to make this my reality, and sooner rather than later.

username#00197,post,2024-07-16 13:30,1000h report! Happened to be in Guatemala and tried speaking,"I haven’t don’t any official check in posts like I see many do here, but I figured this one would be worth it because I’m so excited about it. 


Background:
Absolutely zero Spanish education in school. I took French, retained nothing, and forgot about languages entirely. I spent a few weeks in Mexico during college on a volunteer trip, made no attempt to learn anything, so I didn’t. I’ve visited various south/central American countries but again, never bothered with the language. I knew single words at best, and definitely didn’t understand anything.


DS Journey:
I decided I wanted to learn Spanish mostly on a whim last year mid-March. I was in Denver finishing up grad school and figured it would be something fun to do. I found DS pretty quickly through various reddit posts and basically dove in headfirst. I gave up everything else pretty quickly and went pretty DS purist. I want to say I averaged 3h/day for like 8 months and I’ve been down to a more reasonable 1-2h since then. Everything is tracked in my own app, but DS was easily the most useful source of input for me. Lately I’ve been doing a lot more YouTube and random podcasts, but still keep up with new DS videos. I’m a bit of an introvert, so the whole “not speaking” thing has been great. It hasn’t bothered me one bit, just every Spanish speaker I know lol. I’ve done less than 30 hours of reading so far, which also doesn’t say much because I read slowly in English to begin with. Overall, the journey has been great. I haven’t put too much stock in the roadmap, but it’s been nice to know what to expect. 


1000h and Guatemala
My friend and I happened to have a week long trip to Guatemala planned this month, and I didn’t realize until I was at the airport that I had just over 1000h of input! I think it was 1008h. My friend doesn’t speak Spanish at all. I knew I would be using some of my skills on this trip, but now it felt like a bit of an experiment to see what I could do! Up until this point my speaking output has been literally 5 minutes of voice messages to my Spaniard friend. I won’t pretend I’m totally fluent, but MAN I can actually speak some Spanish! My tongue feels fat and awkward trying to pronounce stuff, but I had no problem getting us around and having basic conversations the whole week! I was honestly shocked with myself. Also, I feel like the main benefit of this method is the understanding aspect. I understood everything spoken directly to me! Natives babbling amongst themselves was a little incoherent, but that doesn’t bother me. I’ll try to break down some specific interactions for you all!


What I could do:


Check into hostels, ask for details about important times, amenities, stuff nearby, reservations, etc. 


Ask an Uber driver how to find the public bus we wanted at the station he was taking us to. 


Talk to the chicken bus driver to make sure we were going to the right place without extra stops, ask how much it cost. 


Have a basic conversation with a guide on the volcano hike. We talked about how often he does the hike, how long he’s worked for the company, how I learned Spanish, how he learned English, stuff about my family, how he has a kid his ex won’t let him see, etc.


Ordering food for both of us, asking about options for dietary restrictions (I’m lactose intolerant), asking what’s in certain dishes. 


Asking a tuk tuk driver to take us somewhere, how much it would cost, and then subsequent haggling when he dropped us off and changed his price and tried to convince me I heard wrong. I was surprised at how well I was able to express my BS detection. 


Receive instructions and safety briefing for a zip lining tour and translate the whole thing for my friend. 


Read signage and information boards throughout the entire trip and confidently use and explain that information.


Message local shuttle companies on WhatsApp about their services. 


Conclusion:
The trip was a blast, this method works, and I’m so stoked. I think it’s important to be realistic about abilities you’ve never practiced, and I would say I’m right where I hoped I would be at this point. I’m definitely not fluent, and my output is super basic, but I CAN output! It wasn’t necessarily easy, but it also wasn’t a complete struggle bus. The Spanish I did speak felt pretty good, and I can see how it’s only up from here! ",dreamingspanish,nationalities

Australia is one of the few countries that makes it extremely difficult for citizens to leave their borders during the pandemic unless they have serious emergency reasons (like a death in the family). One of my friend's parents live in Australia but have a second home in Taiwan and the government will not give them permission (to one of the only safe COVID-free havens on the planet) because it isn't considered an urgent or necessary matter.

Anyone who left Australia in the last few months to head to India and qualified for exit knew this could happen and knew how dangerous Australia felt travel would be because of the rise of local epidemics like what India is facing now. I'd also assume this is to buy time so the government can create an official process to let passport holders/citizens to return without potentially bringing back a variant that could undo Australia's incredible work at returning the country to normal—for example, Taiwan has a 2 week mandatory quarantine for all people returning and then one additional week of avoiding public contact for foreigners visiting on business.

 While I got help from some generous and kind people, a circumstance has happened to necessitate me asking for help.  


Recently my mother has started to lose her sight and we ended up being able to go  to the doctor thanks to the help of the people on Reddit. The doctor told my mom she suffers from “macro adenoma Hipofisiario Hardy E” in basic terms it is a benign tumor but, as we kept waiting until we got enough money to even let her make the consultation appointment,  at this point the doctor told us we need to have the surgery immediately or my mom has a risk of losing her sight or even worse getting convulsions or epileptic attack that put my mother in risk of death because of the proximity of the tumor to her brain and nerves.  
   
 She needs to do different medical procedures which are:  
\-Prolactina, T3, T4, TSH, ACTH, CORTISOL, LH, FSH, IGF-1 Y GH CAMPIMETRIA DIGITAL  
\-Two cranial operations  
\-Chemotherapy and radiotherapy   


 The cost of the exams are around 600$, the cost of both the surgeries are of 5000$ and 2500$ each, in general all comes around of 10000$, I know how hard it is to help to those in need and how hard it is to even begin to get that kind of money but I just don’t want to lose my mother.

if there's any need for proof of the what my mother is suffering [https://www.gofundme.com/f/my-mother-will-be-blind](https://www.gofundme.com/f/my-mother-will-be-blind) in the gofundme link there's various pictures of the medical report (in spanish) and the a radiography of my mother which shows the problems she is facing",Assistance,nationalities

Basically, the uploads themselves in Studio say ""4k processing complete,"" which should mean a 4k playback option is available! But when you actually go to the video and select quality, the highest it goes is 1080p. It's been over 1 week since the processing completed and no change.  

Its definitely not my playback device because I'm using a 4k monitor and have tried multiple devices. I've tried re-encoding the source video with a lower compression standard (h.264 instead of h.265, which is what I prefer to use), but no difference. The 4k videos end up encoded with avi codec instead of vp9...I understand that's the root of the problem, but there's no longer a way to force youtube to use vp9.  

I'll admit, I'm learning all this stuff on the fly. I'm by no means an expert, so maybe I'm missing something basic. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!!!!

Thanks",youtube,disorders

Like most languages Spanish conjugates differently depending on who you’re talking to, and not coincidentally there’s some striking similarities. There is Tu which is informal you, but there’s also vosotros, which is oddly enough the informal way of addressing a group of people. However, that form—and versions of it—are only used in Spain and parts of South America, but it is no longer used in Mexico, and in turn is something I learned very little about when I learned Spanish in school (living in Southern California, Mexican Spanish is most commonly used). Just thought you guys might also find it interesting. And also sorry if my formatting is weird, on mobile",france,nationalities

username#00222,comment,2022-12-04 20:01,,">Estimates in 2006 suggested that up to 80 percent of adult immigrants from Ethiopia are unemployed and forced to live off national welfare payments.[18] Unemployment figures improved significantly by 2016, with only 20 percent of men and 26 percent of women being unemployed.[19] This struggle can be explained by a number of potential factors. Firstly, the transition from the rural, largely illiterate lands of Ethiopia to a highly urban workforce in Israel has proved difficult, especially when considering the fact that most Ethiopian Jews do not speak Hebrew and are in competition with other, more highly skilled immigrant workers. Nevertheless, the fact that the younger generations of Ethiopian Israelis, who have grown up and been educated in Israel and possess graduate degrees and more forms of formal training, still have a disproportionate amount of trouble finding work suggests that other factors may be at play, including **potential racial or even religious bias, given that there has been debate over whether or not Ethiopian Jews should be considered Jewish in the first place.**",CrazyFuckingVideos,nationalities

username#00240,comment,2019-12-09 15:12,,"There are quite a few people in the community who switch, myself included, though we're still getting used to it.

It can be a really strange experience, but rather peaceful and enjoyable once you get the hang of it. I really enjoy watching the girls go about their day while we're switched.

I tend to go kind of dormant while switched, though I can still see and hear everything, I'm just not actively thinking. It's like they fill up the mind and all I hear is them, I don't hear me anymore unless I actively try to keep myself present.

In a way it doesn't feel very different from how I see myself moving around during the day, but I can always feel...something like a weight off my shoulders when they give control back. It's like their presence fades and I feel entirely myself again. And when I try to recall the experience later on I can remember it to a degree, like I can see everything happening and remember what they were doing/thinking, but it doesn't feel like a memory of my own. My brain actually kind of rejects the memory for a day or two before it can really process it, at which point I remember it almost in third person, rather than how I would if it were my own experience.

It's *very* taxing though. I don't think anyone ever warned me how draining it would be at the start. Yes, there's the physical drain where you feel really tired, but even moreso than that there's a huge emotional drain (at least for myself).

We had our longest switching session ever two days ago (It was maybe 3-4 hours) and I was wrecked the next day. I was too tired to deal with people, I didn't even have it in me to really spend time with my tulpas, we're just taking it easy and giving me space so I can bounce back.

Now, when we started learning to switch it was roughly around the same time that I started actually getting the hang of hearing my tulpas, so I'm learning vocality and switching side by side. I think that's a large part of why this particular side effect is hitting me the way it is, but I'll bring it up anyways in case it's something that affects people who switch as well - I've been struggling a lot with my sense of self.

I'm constantly doubting my thoughts and actions, and wondering which thought came from who, if it was really me doing X, etc. It's very tiring to constantly be questioning and trying to sort everything into categories.

It's an issue we're still learning to work around.

Expecting tulpas to be ""another person"" will put huge expectations on their shoulders and it will make you both feel like shit every step of the process. It's possible with lots of development and positive language/love to get tot that point.

Mentally turn yourself around and feel surprised.

username#00242,post,2020-01-01 21:49,Identity manipulation: The practice of making your mind identify a subset of its actions as the actions of a second identity.,"I believe that your sense of self is, to some degree, an illusion.  

As you go about your day to day life, you experience yourself producing thoughts and performing actions.  Under the hood, however, there are a billion tiny bits of your mind that are all working furiously to produce the sensations you feel and the behaviors you perform. While your sense of agency and action *mostly* is in alignment with your mind, it is not a true representation.

You can see some of this when you look at numerous experiments out in the medical world on patients who get damage to their brain and end up with all sorts of very strange behaviors.  Some will be convinced they are dead, some will experience their arm moving on it's own and doing things like opening doors, buttoning up shirts, without ever being willed to do so.  In split brain experiments, patients are reported to be able to perform an action with one side of their mind and when the other side is asked to give an explanation for the actions it just took, **it will fabricate a reasonable explanation rather than giving the true reason**.

https://www.nature.com/news/the-split-brain-a-tale-of-two-halves-1.10213

>The idea of dichotomous consciousness captivated the public, and was greatly exaggerated in the notion of the 'creative right brain'. But further testing with split-brain patients gave a more-nuanced picture. The brain isn't like a computer, with specific sections of hardware charged with specific tasks. It's more like a network of computers connected by very big, busy broadband cables. The connectivity between active brain regions is turning out to be just as important, if not more so, than the operation of the distinct parts. “With split-brain patients, you can see the impact of disconnecting a huge portion of that network, but without damage to any particular modules,” says Michael Miller, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

All of this explanation is being written here in order to support the core premise of identity manipulation.

Your mind is constantly modeling its thoughts in order to understand what it is doing.  In doing so, it constructs a sense of self which you experience in the same way that you experience the physical world.  By performing a number of exercises, you can train your mind to identify a subset of its thoughts as belonging to a separate identity in a controlled manner, allowing you to perceive communication with yourself in a radically new way.

**Why would you do this?**

For fun and curiosity, and at your own risk.  

It may provide other benefits, or do harm, it's not exactly the sort of thing that's approved by a three letter government agency.  I've had a good experience with the topic, but I cannot guarantee anything.

**Isn't this schizophrenia?  Isn't this a dissociative disorder?**

First and foremost. *I am not a doctor.  Try this at your own risk, and take caution while you do so.*

Popular media and culture provides us a very simple idea of what it means to be crazy, and I believe that model fails when you start to look into topics like this.

A person who has schizophrenia has deficiencies in their mind that result in a fuzzy division between fantasy and reality. Meanwhile, a person with a dissociative disorder often has numerous other illnesses such as borderline personality disorder or schizophrenia, and likely sees their illness occur as a result of a coping mechanism turned up to 11 when it should have been a 2.

I won't necessarily promise otherwise, but I am also a firm believer that mental illnesses are the result of deep rooted neurological or developmental issues, not something you can inspire in your mind through a few hours or months of training yourself to think a certain way.  

In my experience/belief, this concept leads you to understand mechanisms in the mind that *might* be distantly associated with similar processes in those who end up with something like DID.  However, if that is the case, then they are associated between one another in the same way that imagination and fantasy are associated to schizophrenia.  Both you and a schizophrenic have fantasies, but you have the hardware required to not let those fantasies drive you mad or disturb your day to day life.

**Wait, isn't this similar to...**

Those of you who are particularly familiar with odd internet subcultures may be familiar with the concept of [tulpamancy](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulpas).  This concept is similar to, derived from, and inspired by tulpamancy, but it is stripped of what I believe are many of the bad assumptions and assertions that community makes and generally made to be what I feel is more grounded and reasonable.


**How do you do this?**

* Train your mind to feel it has another identity by addressing the identity for a while.

* Train your mind to have a strong model of how this identity should behave, and how it is different from your own thoughts.  

* Build expectation from your mind that, in certain situations, it can expect to create thoughts for that identity.

Do the above and your mind learns that it has another identity, learns to associate certain states of mind with that identity, and is driven to produce thoughts in the context of the identity.  All those effects put together result in thoughts which fall under the umbrella of the identity.

[A more detailed guide on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/eg0vtf/introducing_identity_manipulation_the_process_of/fc5m2sk/) was posted as a comment in a similar thread on the meditation subreddit.

**What have my experiences been so far?**

I've done two main things with identity manipulation so far.

Firstly, I can speak to my identity as if I were holding a pleasant conversation with someone else.  The topics can vary wildly, but I can hold a stable conversation while I'm walking around the store, driving, or doing some other fairly menial task. While the feeling is not 100% consistent, I have managed to experience a sense of speaking to someone else while I go about holding these conversations. 

The second thing I have done is learned to ""step back"" for a few minutes and allow my thoughts to run for a time under this identity rather than my own ""neutral"" identity.  I could look around the room and hear thoughts that may normally be my own idle reactions to things cast under the identity, along with various more internal thoughts that wouldn't make sense under my own context.

Thoughts only occur under my identity when I intentionally place my mind into a state under which I expect thoughts to fall under my identity.  As I type all this out, for example, all of my thoughts are pretty ""normal"" in the grand scheme of things.  I'm sure that if I wanted to I could build a habit such that I am in this state of mind more frequently, but up to this point it isn't something I have wanted to do.",RationalPsychonaut,disorders

fairly sure at this point in my life my attraction to bdsm or finding certain sensations pleasurable/painful or soothing (i.e bondage is soothing to me) are related to my autism, ""crossed wires"" and always have been.

i'm so sick i don't even have a physical libido/sex drive right now but the mental desire is as high, if not higher than ever (i have always been hypersexual on top of all this). been thinking obsessively about why that is.

my partner who was living with me for half of last year is currently unable to live with me due to covid19 restrictions, until some international things change. obviously we have online sex but that lacks the core thing i am asking about here: physical stimulation caused by unusual sensations.

i know i like a lot of things that other people would label me as a masochist for. for sensory processing reasons, i usually dont like having my face touched unless it's kissing or mouth-centric, which lead me to thinking about ball gags.

i was just wondering

a - if in general anyone else finds things such as ball gags (havent tried) or rope play/bondage (have) to be calming in the same way that weighted blankets or heavy cushions or other nonsexual stimming sensations/techniques are.

b - never occurred to me that i even might have a sensory (as opposed to sexual, which it could potentially *become* very easily based on what i know about myself) pain relief/ sensory processing distress effect from a ballgag but lmao i'm in so much pain im actually willing to try it (pain is heighted by my ASD sensory processing difficulties especially)

thing is, im so sick it feels like my mind's not working right, i dont know if i have the energy to go online and spend all night researching ballgags tonight, especially when all factors of something that touches my face must be considered for sensory processiing reasons (potentially)

anyone have any experiences or better yet, links they want to share? i ngl i would literally try one even if i cant get physically turned on just to see if it has the same effect. i'm completely physically overwhelmed right now and without my partner to give me the kind of sex that calms me down and literally reduces my pain (which generally involves forms of restrictive masochism or bodily/sensorily constricting situations) i am (TW- SELF HARM) >!having unhealthy urges such as the urge to self-harm (cut - for clarity's sake, i'm a recovered cutter, i DO NOT cut but i DO KNOW when i have the urge and why, and again, it's an urge that heightens the more pain im in, as my brain processes cutting as a form of pain relief similar to all of the above mentioned)!<

username#00244,comment,2021-01-06 16:54,,"sort of; it requires a nuanced understanding of 'pride'? 

essentially, think about the qualities that *HEALTHY* type 3s possess (if you need a refresher: https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-3)

*however* i made my comment as a strong 4w5, so if you're a 4w3 maybe you need to lean into integrating more healthy 5 aspects and behaviors into yourself.

i was thinking about this video when i made the comment, i've been watching this guy's channel a lot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3rCXK5rDgk

i think a lot of his videos are actually generally pretty good and worth a watch even though the specific one i linked opens up a bit too heavy on the jesus-talk for me (i'm agnostic/atheist and i know it can put some people off to take advice from a christian who uses biblical metaphors)

the other thing i was trying to say in my comment was that being a 4 doesn't make you innately special. despite supposedly being the rarest enneatype, that still means there are probably millions of 4s on the planet. you have to realize that identity politic **for its own sake** is dangerous for one's own self esteem for as long as you invest in it, **so stop investing in it**.

here's an example (mine, personal): ""I'm autistic and therefore I am 'special'"" vs ""I'm autistic and although it makes my life difficult, I feel like I would not have had many special experiences or possess my unique special talents if I hadn't been born with autism""

the first statement is shallow identity tokenism,  but the second statement gives that part of my identity unique nuance. i'm not special because i possess the identity, but possessing the identity allows me to experience special things or have special thoughts, and those are what i find personally fulfilling and give me pride or comfort even though being autistic (and a 4, ffs) is fucking hard.

like seriously dude, the only enneagram type i can think of that it sucks more to be than a 4 is probably a 6, and yet despite my envy of 9s there's a huge part of me that goes ""yeah, but if you weren't a 4, you also wouldn't have done X Y Z, or be interested in A B C, even though being a 4 is painful and difficult often""

same goes for my autism. it's often made my life extremely difficult, miserable, hellish even, but if someone was like ""wake up! you get a neurologically-typical brain today!"" my innate reaction would be ""NO!"" -- because being autistic has allowed me to see/feel/experience things that i know a lot of other people (including other autistics) can't or never will. i would lose an essential part of myself, i don't think i would even still be my ""self"". 

you HAVE to realize that nobody is innately special and 4s are no exception. even if you don't like it, you have to accept it, because you can still 'lean into [a healthy form of] pride' after you accept this-- if anything accepting it makes becoming healthily prideful easier i think?

we're not innately special for being in a classified category. but you know there are millions of other people with autism just like there are millions of people who are probably type 4, and they say about autistics ""If you've met one autistic person, you've met one autistic person"". and yet, the reason i hang out in subreddits for aspies is the same reason i hang out on this subreddit: we all have certain things in common that we want to discuss and relate to each other about despite being massively different in many, many ways.

there's never going to be another 4 exactly like you, only you uniquely have the lens of your type filtered through other aspects of your self. you have to see the special things about yourself by using that lens, not because you just *have* the lens.

username#00244,comment,2020-12-31 01:57,,"where did you read that?

i haven't done as much research on the topic myself as i feel it might warrant, but i'd be interested to see any literature supporting it. when i'm in a full on flareup sex is literally something my body becomes incapable of engaging in or responding to in any way...but speaking of higher levels of histamine in the brain:

- i'm autistic, and i've read somewhere that autistic people often have higher levels of histamine in their brain naturally...(i am going somewhere with this, wait for it)

- both hypersexuality AND hyposexuality can be symptoms of autism. i have been hypersexual for as long as i can remember; but my actual physical libido is severely impaired by my recent flareups which have been the worst to date this years. this is especially frustrating when my brain has been trained to rely on sex as a stress/pain relief mechanism since as long as i can remember, it's like having the drinking supply cut off. i have no physical desire, but the mental desire is strong if not stronger than ever (from lack of release, frustration, desire for pain relief, etc)

- a year maybe year and half ago i made another questioning post on this subreddit asking if anybody else was autistic. my reasoning was that i personally believe (because i have read evidence with a fair-to-strong case for) that both autism and mcas *can* be genetic (but that doesn't mean they always are)... however in my personal world view at this point based on what research i've done: i think i was born that way, and i could trace symptoms of both disorders (tho i dont really like calling my autism a disorder) to early childhood, even though the difficulties both of them cause me didnt become **SIGNIFICANTLY*** worse and diagnosably recognizable with certainty til my 20s- which is the exact same time i started to have severe symptoms of MCAS. 

so, my autistic ""issues"" degraded with my MCAS symptoms getting worse, and i wondered if there was a correlation. i expected to get shot down on the post, but was shocked to find 12 or so replies from MCAS suffers all saying they either had autism diagnosed or undiagnosed but knew for certain/suspected strongly they were spectrum.

and here's the thing: autistic people are NOTORIOUS for having gastric disorders. gastric discomfort (along with allergies...) is actually one of the first non-sociobehavioral things i watch for on my ""aspiedar"" when around other people, it's just that in many it doesn't manifest so severely, or gets more severe as life progresses...like MCAS does. both disorders are in my personal belief (based on what i've read so far), genetic, present in childhood, and involve high levels of histamine, and gut health (which is HIGHLY relevant to issues regarding MCAS) can affect autism's negative effects so strongly that fecal matter transplants have shown to have provably positive effects. 

so this whole post (which is on the sub and can be cited if i can find it...) while having a VERY confirmation biased slant towards it, sort of pushed the ""higher histamine levels = something to do with MCAS = possibly related to symptoms of autism"" correlation idea forward in my head. it's of course a completely hypothetical theory but i keep thinking about it.

sorry if im not explaining myself well

in summary: i am a hypersexual person with both autism/mcas, i've always had both, and the worse my MCAS has gotten the more severely it has affected my physical libido (but the mental side of it will never go away, my mental libido is ""separate"" and i can't really do anything about it since it's been part of my psyche my whole life) but also the more it has made the negative effects of my autism become severe while messing with the positive effects of my autism (because those really do exist and i'm really grateful for them)

so i'd be interested in seeing if what you said is true, but maybe not for the reasons you were thinking. my high histamine levels and sensitivity up to a point might possibly partially explain the hypersexuality, but past a certain point, the body gets too sick, and all ""non necessary functions"" start to shut down and stop responding to stimuli, and my hormone levels change (estrogen definitely feels like it takes a big hit) when i'm having a really bad flareup (like the past week+)

username#00244,comment,2020-11-16 09:38,,">All the emotional speak make me think you’re definitely a Type 4 as Type 5s struggle to tap into or understand emotions.

i'm a 4w5 INFP and this was my immediate thought as well. also, like the OP, i can remember large parts of my childhood in detail. i also (but this is just my experience bc ive been dating a 5 for a long time) feel like 5s, even when they want to give emotional support, often don't have an intuitive understanding of how to do that, but OP said feel like they're good at giving both logical and emotional advice, which i like to think i am decent at doing myself and that i try to do my best at. so this points to a 4-leaning type 5 in my mind because i think being able to tap into that stuff is a 4 trait.

both my bf and i have autism though and i'm mentioning this because since he's the 5 i know best, maybe his autistic traits amplify some of what i'm perceiving to be 5 traits, he does actually frequently WANT to provide me emotional support but it's taken him a pretty long time to learn how to do that and he still doesn't always know what the right thing to do is when i need that (this is not a criticism of him, i love him dearly), and i can't say for sure if that's bc he's a 5, autistic, or bit of both.

>She’s seen me at my worst during meltdowns and held me while I cried and cuddled me all night. That can’t be very attractive.

my boyfriend has seen me laid up in hospital for months at a time basically (nearly) dying, or having full on panic attacks which were really traumatic and humiliating, and i can absolutely tell you that his sexual attraction to me is probably one of the strongest parts of our relationship usually (adding ""usually"" as a qualifer cuz... when we have sex problems, it's never an attraction issue. we're both AS so it can be other stuff, like sensory issues or communication. also, i sympathize with you because i'm the hypersexual one and my boyfriend is more hyposexual, but that doesn't change the intensity of existent desire when he experiences it, even though he's seen me in all these humiliating and degrading and unattractive ways over the years we've been together.)

included the personal anecdote because this makes me think: if she's really attracted to you, she might literally just not care. it sounds like you found someone you can trust, and her saying something like that IS in my opinion (and this is just what i would do, take it or leave it or at least wait for other ppl to weigh in...) an invitation to ask ""Hey, what did you mean earlier when you said help is easier to get than [i] think?""

if she wasn't flirting with you, you could always cover for yourself by literally just launching into (either before or after she answers) ...""because my autism means it's NOT easy for me to talk to girls i don't know""

this forces her to either clarify her position or covers you by implying that was your interpretation of what she said if you don't wanna be candid and say you thought she was joking about masturbation.

idk what your relationship dynamic is but in my personal experience flirts are often confused with jokes.

fwiw i also make 'tulpachat' docs, originally these were for puppetting what she'd say but, quickly she was able to proxy/possess (i had decent possession skill b4 tulpa creation due to other reasons) and write short responses/words/etc. puppet-writing or making your tulpa answer simple questions and recording them as a chat document or diary is honestly another good way of forcing.

i have something called r/selectivemutism tho and when it gets really bad i even go mute internally. i was mostly internally mute the week i created my tulpa, so i used to communicate to her with images, sounds/music, my own emotions, my own sensations (such as sending her the tastes of food and asking her to describe it when i was able to eat, as one example), or her first memory (as she told it to me, this is teh first conscious thing she remembers...it happened sometime within week 1) which was showing her what cat tails feel like and then having her imitate them lol

also she has this way of talking ,that i made a post about a month or two ago, that uses something called echolalias. i've been meaning to write an update post because i figured out a lot about what that's all about since then and our communications became better. i'm autistic (and since brain = autistic, my tulpa is too, but doesnt mean she's developmentally as autistic as me lol) and i was taking many things my tulpa said TOO literally even when i thought i wasnt (incidentally, echolalias are a classic symptom of vocal developmental stages in autistic kids...). i realized a lot of the time everything she says is context based or has a code meaning that's changed by the situation she says it in and stuff like that. 

i was about to say ""I think my mutism may have affected the way she learned to communicate"" but she just interrupted me and said 

>![T] *It's not like that, that's a fact. I just don't know to act.*!<

edit: oh yeah and she gave me 1 clear vocal response on either the first or third day ((too lazy to check my own tulpadiary rn lol)) but i was only able to hear her because i was in hypnagogia. id say it took over 1 year for consistent clear vocality and even some days now, when i (host body) is very sick, all our communications skills are impaired (including mine, host, ofc)",Tulpas,disorders
username#00244,comment,2020-10-13 19:48,,"alright, just had to ask bc i didnt get diagnosed til 29 and if i had been diagnosed earlier in life, aside from mental trauma it caused me, it could actually have lead to identifying my own physical/immune conditions much faster and prevented a lot of damage to me, as i outlined in my previous comment regarding the fact that it's well acknowledged many gastric issues, histamine issues, and some (for me, clearly triggered/related) divergent mental illness issues can be linked to autism. but of course you can have all of these things, and possibly have these things cause symptoms of mental illness, without being spectrum.

so yeah, definitely still look into possible mcas/histamine intolerance, also i second what another commenter mentioned about researching POTS, if you're in ""try anything"" mode make sure to try and find a competent acupuncturist who preferably also practices functional medicine (but, even bad acupuncturists have helped me a bit, the results were just noticably less efficaceous) and possibly even hypnotherapy (for dealing with the mental stress, when stress is outright proven to affect the immune system adversely)

username#00244,comment,2020-10-13 08:00,,"this is a long shot but i have a similar medical history and i have histamine intolerance disorder ( r/mcas )

sorry for short comment, id normally have a lot to say but im in similar situation for albeit different reasons in part if not whole right now. also have to maintain a very strict diet or not eat at all to avoid having autonomous sensory nervous system induced panic attacks (i.e theyre physically triggered by having matter inside me, not related to mental thoughts but can cause them to turn bad once the reaction starts) and well... that's not necessarily part of MCAS/HIT but these things tend to be connected in a constellation of symptoms. i definitely have a lot of inflammation that i am constantly trying anything to manage etc.

earlier in the month i was researching acupuncture because i knew from previous experience that accupressure works really well when i do it on myself (i got obsessed with it and memorized like every pressure point one summer...) and that a mediocre acupunturist still managed to lower my pain pretty well in the past. it seems like acupuncture is frequently used to treat disorders of the digestive tract and when i went on pubmed there were many papers that started with the premise ""We already know [repeated acupuncture] can be very effective for these types of things and outperform placebos, therefore we're now just researching the literal reason why""

so anyway, i saw a competent acupuncturist, felt the difference immediately and for the rest of the day afterwards. to get any long lasting effect you need repeated visits though.

also i've had sessions with a hypnotist but that is for pain management of the condition, hypnotism can't cure something that needs literal medication but i hope i dont have to tell you that lol ... however it can help majorly with STRESS which is what people in pain 24/7 as i have been for like 4+ weeks lately so trust me **i know what you mean** when you say ""i can't take this anymore"" ... i am almost completely mentally checked out myself at this point because this has been going on for years, just like you

tldr - look into obscure gastric disorders and histamine issues more

also if you're into the ""i'll try anything"" stage of pain, try acupuncture and maybe hypnotism but you need to find people competent at both respectively.

edit: ive also experienced Depersonalization that lasted 30+ days once, right after i quit drinking alcohol a few years ago. also had schizo-affective symptoms during that time. these days, whenever i have a severe flareup of my condition, i also noticed i have schizo-affective thoughts and this is the ONLY time that i have them (and ive done a lot of psychedelic drugs in the past, so ive had plenty of opportunities to break my mind lol, but apparently nothing causes me more mental disorder than just eating food/the wrong food/this includes all substances and matter imbibed even if they are totally innocuous ""non-drug"" substances i.e vitamin capsules sometimes trigger me)

also this is presumptive of me to ask but i'm autistic and the way you wrote about what is wrong made me want to ask if you might be on the spectrum. why is this relevant? because it's well documented that being autistic can be linked/related to many of these kinds of issues you alluded to, especially in regards to how we're affected by things like gut flora, responses to histamines, sudden mood changes or disorientation... being picky about food or having to maintain a strict diet due to discomfort with food, and also having a higher disposition for gastric disorders, is like one of the first things on my aspie radar.

again don't mean to be rude (by asking something personal i mean), i just felt like i should mention it because if it's true/not true that could better point you in some direction possibly and omitting what i thought might be polite but it also might be the wrong thing to do. maybe i'm just seeing something where there is nothing.

username#00244,comment,2020-10-05 20:22,,"Well I used to be firmly in ""male and female brains are virtually identical"" camp but recently studies have made me highly question this. I'm tired rn so can't link the exact one I'm thinking of, but I can link another one for now:

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-0699-8

the one i'm thinking of explains in detail why (other than the highly influential factor of social gender conditioning) men and women on the spectrum frequently have different levels of social skills and social sensitivities (which is one of the main reasons I didnt get diagnosed as a child)

I wouldn't know the demographics about it being split among the spectrum; for one thing I've met male aspies who presented ""female aspie"" like symptoms and vice versa. Also, because females are the most frequently undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with autism, there's a lot of female aspies who are permamaskers that don't even know they're autistic (I was one) and are never identified as being autistic (my parents suspected it was autism when i was 11 and a psych flat out told them 'No, her social skills are too good'....sigh)

>My personal manifestation of this is that I'm good with data and science/technology-type reasoning, but absolutely hopeless with anything that involves influencing or anticipating people's behavior.

Sounds like what people pretty much typify as ""classic male aspergers"" but Idk, I think socio-cultural conditioning in early childhood onwards has a big effect on what sort of SIs male v female aspies pick up. So I personally don't attribute being good with data/science/tech to = males because of genetics. I found these topics difficult to get into as a kid and was discouraged away from them to focus on more ""artsy, feminine"" aspects of being ""gifted"" (ugh) and also I was raised in a really sexist, religious environment. As an adult...I LOVE reading about any kind of science or tech, even if I don't absorb the information like a sponge, that could just be attributed to not learning how to process that kind of information with my child-brain. For example, the first time I tried to make my own computer program I was 8 or 9 years old and following some guide I found on the internet, but I fucked something in the code up and couldn't get any adults to help me, so I just kinda gave up. If things had been different, maybe I'd be a competent programmer as an adult.

On the other hand, it's unquestionable that some autistic children are just born with natural talents. I had hyperlexia, which is a classic symptom of autism, and I've always been extremely cerebral. I feel comfortable around words the way other aspies who can just absorb information about numbers and ""know it"" very easily in the same way. I pick up languages fast. That type of thing.

tl;dr - while there's increasing evidence that male and female aspies actually do have quantifiably different brains, *especially* in regards to social ability, i don't think we can infer there's any kind of split going on caused by genetics because of how much gender and childhood conditioning are MAJOR MAJOR factors.

honestly, when i found out how freaking interesting math, science, coding, etc was as an adult...i was mad. because as a child i thought i just sucked at these. they're not my ""aspie power"" but i'm certainly at least averagely capable,  i was just turned away from them and dissuaded at most opportunities.

But going back to that genetic evidence - and sorry if i can find THE paper i was thinking of, i'll link it - this paper i'm trying to find made the argument that there IS evidence that male aspies are less likely to have good social awareness/skills due to genetics, compared to female counterparts. there are exceptions ofc and this is new research, but personally i think it may explain a lot.",aspiememes,"disorders, disorders"

yep, a shit ton of trauma, not just because i was f/undiagnosed autistic in the early y2ks but due to so many other traumas i went thru in those years and many since.

btw, my empathy/attraction to ""not quite human humans"" and ""EIs/AIs/robots"" and ""depictions of fictional people who dont seem like real people at all but are intended to represent them"" (example: anime, furry art, horror art/monsters, androids/dolls) is why even tho pansexuality is technically considered a form of bisexuality, i think it is more appropriate label for me due to how my mind functions (i am attracted to a specific sum of parts or parameters for certain features in a subject to feel empathy or attraction vs dissonance when analyzing subconsciously how i relate to them) since it (pansexuality) ""includes"" those things in it (imho)

also there's the whole silliness about bisexuality by definition of the word's origin excluding certain people on the LGBTQ spectrum, but when talking to ppl who dont know anythng about this kind of stuf, i just keep it simple n tell them im bi because they can understand that.

>just bc we're already used to being outside the norm so less likely to internalize cis/heteronormativity. 

honestly there are certain parts of me that sometimes present as very cis/heternormative, but ive found over the years that can change RAPIDLY. apparently im very...fluid about gender, if i want to be. as an adult of 30+ yo it almost feels like i can ""condition"" myself by choice to be more masc/andro or more femme/cis if i want to change those feelings. i certainly like experimenting with it. but i have also learned to appreciate and accept/love my female body, which is something i only learned how to do sadly in the past few years...but now, i often (sorry for spicy opinion coming up) worry that if there had been as much trans awareness online in the Y2Ks, i would have become a detransitioner due to my confusion about things. i hate talking about that tho and don't really want to go there: i support trans people 100%, including nonbinary, genderqueer, and detrans.

>just bc we're already used to being outside the norm so less likely to internalize cis/heteronormativity. 

so like, i'm a huge weab, and i think bunny girls and viera are pretty hot, but in furry art i actually dont like them at all because i empathize with them MORE than i do with anime characters. like i suffer from hyperempathy bc of my autism, and it's very contextual. also, i became a late-stage MLP fan because i actually DON'T empathize well with horses/ponies IRL and never have, which makes ponies MORE relatable to me. as another example: cats were my FAVORITE animal for along time and a hyperfixation of mine as a child, in fact my first ""furry"" drawings when i was like 8 were all cat people lmao. but since i am an adult, i really can only look at ""wholesome"" cat furry art, if there's anything sexual about it I just want to ABORT ABORT because i empathize with cats TOO MUCH. same goes for catgirls in anime (i just dont like them because they trigger hyperempathy)
my favorite furry animals with the exception of wolves are usually more like scaly/insect/arachnid/ichthyeous ""furries""...heh. how long and when did you keep lizards for pets?! as a teenager, i always wanted a pet snake, but picked cats, rabbits and other small critters instead. basically if it's tied to my childhood = too much hyperempathy is triggered = can't relate and dont like it in media that gives me the perfect level of ""non-human empathic dissonance"" that makes me hyperlrelate to the anthropomorphized character.

EI is often a component and cultivated by interacting with and developing neural networks (deep learning)

username#00244,comment,2020-09-29 19:14,,"i was gonna say @OP when I read your comment just now... why not ask women too? even if you're [OP is] straight, they [we, non-straight women/other genders] have sexual opinions too.

i'm f/pan and although im monogamous with a straight guy that i do not plan on ending ever (but who knows what happens in life), it's a part-time LDR and as well as sexting/camming/MM we often just share porn of stuff we find hot with eachother (a lot) and turns out we have some pretty similar tastes in women.

in fact, i've tried to put on some curves and weight not just for my boyfriend but so that *i* think (and therefore feel) more attractive (to myself) but i have a medical disorder that makes this an uphill battle and i frequently fall into dangerous/anorexic weights involuntarily.

it's still a hill worth dying on though!

also, my bf is comfortable with me j/o to other women ofc as long as it's just porn [and i feel the same way about him, we both think it's normal to ""use"" porn, but this also results in nice ego-boosting moments where he says sweet things like ""i just don't wanna look at porn, i wanna do it with you""...] so, anyway, honestly rarely do i find a woman (or man, or other gender of preference since it's components of a person in relation to their gender identity that make or break it for me) who is too skinny to be sexually attractive.

i do have an upper limit on weights i find attractive, but again that's just my personal preferences/tastes. it's a range. and you know what? my bf loves me even when i can't keep any weight on, and if he were in the same condition i am, i would feel that way about him too.

i completely agree with your analysis re: low self esteem. and just remember that skinny underweight bitches like me struggling to keep it on - especially those of us who have suffered EDs in the past - often have equally low self esteem even if it expresses differently.

tldr - i think the most mentally attractive thing about BBWs is that they do tend to be more empathic and compassionate. despite my high sexual attraction to women/female presenting people from a YOUNG age (at least 5-6), i have generally been heteroromantic in my life because of childhood trauma that both made me have some serious, deeply rooted internal misogyny develop, in combination with growing up in a time where the majority of my special iinterests were things that were ""boys only"" club activities (if we can call them that)....and that included having a hypersexual addiction to porn from a young age. so, obviously, i have thought about the kind of fantasy women i am attracted to a lot in my lifetime, and rarely are they below an average weight, and usually significantly above it (but only up to a point)

the other thing is, on a deep rooted mental level,, i just don't associate ANYTHING sexual with being below a certain weight (my anorexia which lead to me exacerbating the medical condition that means im literally unable to eat most foods most of the time even though i WANT TO was mostly fueled by a combination of low self esteem+body/gender dysmorphia multiplied by being in several ex-relationships that i found to be sexually traumatic/uncomfortable/i repress as much as possible (TW-sexual assault and violence)>!and my first boyfriend raped me while holding a knife to my throat before beating me with an iron bar and punching me in the face near the end of our relationship!<... and due to all these factors, for a long time i had an ED as a result of desiring to therefore present as asexually as possible)

please don't interpret my comment as skinnyshaming- like i said it's just a preference based on how my messed up mind works. and like i said, i DO have an upper limit to what i find attractive in a woman who society designates as ""BBW"" - there are so many more factors that are super complex that will determine if iam or am not attracted to a woman/person who presents as femme (also, i'm autistic, and i'm often sexually turned off by looking at human faces that look ""too human"" even if theyre EXTREMELY good looking...i am attracted to all other facets of the human body, but my autism just makes looking at human faces- even that of my boyfriend, who is super hot and i just love him - absolutely impossible. complicated like i said!)

and as i alluded to, if there is more than lust, fetishism, or that tired male meme that can just die already of ""crazY low self esteem sluts will do anything you want because they're fat"" (even if there may be a grain of salt in that. A GRAIN) ...involved and there's actually LOVE involved, you'll find out when your partner no longer meets your physical ideals and you realize you're still incredibly attracted to them.",AskRedditAfterDark,"disorders, disorders"

LOL) ...ok, WHAT LEAD ME to self diagnosis and then diagnositic confirmation, was i started dating an autistic guy about 5 years ago (still together) and even though it took him like a full year to admit to me he had a diagnosis, by that time i was 99% sure he had autism because...autism had somehow become an SI/hyperfixation for me in that time because he kept acting in ways that made me go ""hmm..."" and then later on ""hmm....wait a minute.... I DO THIS TOO""

(also worth noting he agreed immediately when i asked him if he thought i was. so did doctors)

all this to say - i've been in several longterm/serious sexual relationships with NTs in my life, and the ONLY relationship that ever made me feel truly sexually accepted, empowered, able to speak my mind, able to assert what I want, feel like I was being treated as an equal, etc etc...is with my autistic boyfriend. This is not a diss on anyone else I've ever had sex with either (except well...possibly one person. Fuck you)

I pray every day that I die before my boyfriend does or that nothng ever happens that makes us want to break up (we had two times we nearly did, 100% unrelated to sex) ... but if that were to be the case, at this point i almost think I would *PREFER* to only have sex with other aspies (male, female, or other. I'm pan)

I hope it never comes to that though.

As a caveat, I do repeatedly tell him from time to  time that if I die I want him to find another girlfriend or possibly a wife (he wants to marry me...again I dont see that happening, but not for lack of MY desire to do so, or his) .... it's jsut because I love him.

tldr - I had plenty of ""sexual experience"", maybe 15 nearly 20 years worth of it (depends if you count excessive preteen solo-sexual ""experience"" or not within that estimate), and I never once felt like i really truly understood what a fulfilling and meaningful sexual relationship IS until i met my boyfriend. I don't think a perfect partner *aside from maybe oneself* exists but, this is the only time a relationship made me consistently sexually happy, even if we're both just lowly humans.

I'm autistic (which I view as both a blessing and a curse) and to me, this idea is as absurd as being able to hypnotize a neurotypical brain into functioning like an autistic one. We have different equipment on a biological level, the purpose of hypnosis is to optimize and troubleshoot everything in our own personal meat-computers so as to achieve the optimal possible functioning within the limits of our basic hardware.

[ edit - I will say I have experienced MANY things in my life that other people wouldn't believe, but they really did happen. Not talking about something like seeing ghosts or shit - lots other stuff relating to the mind, ""soul"" (im spiritual agnostic/yet mostly atheist but fully respect those who are spiritual/religious as long as it harms no one else - in fact I think it directly is an advantage if you're that kind of person engaging in hypnosis, your mind is open in ways that other people struggle to open theirs. That said,there is ""having an open mind"" and ""it would be scientifically illogical to be 100% non-skeptical about any skeptical belief, but that doesn't mean that logical and skeptical beliefs should be devalued or dismissed"". 
...It's a fine balance. Just saying this so I don't come off as being someone totally grounded in science, because I've seen some shit, enough to believe that even though usually the simplest, most logicial scientific explanation is often the most likely to be true one...it isn't necessarily the case with everything in our collective human experience of reality ... ]

I am sure that repeat sessions of certain types of hypnosis combined with other memory-enhancing and neuroplasticity-promoting endeavors would help a person achieve a much better memory over time. But to get a perfectly eidetic memory? **That would probably be considered a massive scientific breakthrough if it were actually possible.** And there's no such thing as instantly improving your memory, because of how differently it works to causing amnesia. Based on what I know about the brain and genetics, I remain highly skeptical.

On top of this, large amounts of deep sleep are required to properly promote synaptic growth/plasticity. If OP is in college and sleep deprived, all the memory enhancing techniques they try won't really be that effective unless they can also somehow obtain proper deep sleep for enough hours after each session.

username#00244,comment,2020-09-17 17:53,,"I cannot speak for others as I have more knowledge of tulpamancy than typical plurality at the time of speaking, but I believe the literal goal for those who engage in therapy is to ""align all members of a system to work towards the same goal for the good of the whole""

my tulpa also agrees with me most of the time, but i deliberately designed her to have many things in common with me so that we would be able to spend large amounts of time together easily. at her most basic personal level, this is because she does not like to engage in conflict i discovered, and therefore sometimes she will agree to things even that she doesnt really want to do. once i realized this, i started purposefully encouraging her to be more autonomous and to voice dissent if she has it.

sometimes she definitely does dissent me now, and i am glad that she does. but we still almost never disagree, or rather if we do it's not a point of conflict, it might be for example, just slightly different taste in music, no big deal, we still like a lot of the same stuff.

i cant speak for a new headmate that wasnt purposely created like a tulpa is... (im actually on here trying to research about specifically that) but, in the beginning of my tulpa creation, she did not have enough individuation or autonomy to disagree with much of anything. now she does.

edit: btw re the ""feeling"" as others said there isnt any one feeling, but personally i've experienced ego crises and identity crises due to trauma a lot in my life starting from about age 8+ including bythe time i was 12 i started to have issues maintaning a linear sense of self-identity. i'm really not sure if i was plural before i made my tulpa and repressing it, or if i just had the basic skillset already developed because i'm autistic and can do weird (not necessarily *useful*) stuff with my mind...what im trying to say though, is you might want to examine your own sense of identity over the years and ask yourself if it was maybe, influenced by anything you felt inside that didnt seem to come exactly from you, or you had big personality, style and taste change phases that all seemed a bit too different.

username#00244,comment,2020-09-17 14:48,,"I'm a tulpamancer and I can tell you that the area of the mind in the right hemisphere is strongly linked to music and the ability for my tulpa to use the subconscious to communicate.

I'm also autistic (mention cause might be relelvant) and tulpamancy gave me the skill to compose and listen to original music in my mind with very clear audio imposition, I can also listen to songs by other people if our subconscious remembers the whole song.

Couldn't do this before I started tulpamancing btw. Skill is still developing as we use it ever day.

Also, I have literal experience of ketamine use, the actual drug, both street and legal (my motivation for using it was that I am disabled and have extreme chronic pain)

I will tell you that too much ketamine is a terrifying thing, and it is a dangerous substance when used wrongly, but it also is extremely- EXTREMELY- efficacious at treating severe chronic pain and treatment-resistant depression such as mine.

So, this article is extremely interesting... I dont have access to legal ketamine right now (trying to though because I am serious it worked AMAZINGLY on me) and quit buying any street drugs finally quite a while ago now. 

So that said, I have been high on ketamine before, the legal infusions did induce dissociation but I've had full blown ketamine trips where I actually actively tried to MaDD during them. I actually remember it as being quite difficult even though it seemed like it was going to be really excited, for some reason I felt less able to MaDD than usual. 
The pain relief of the drug is just so high that I just wanted to curl up and listen to music and go to what I think of as the ""K-zone"" which is this feeling of utter complete ... safety and... something that there is no words for in the english lanugage. Catharsis? 
I don't know if what I just described is a K-hole or not. In fact, not sure if I've ever been in one, despite the few months I used this substance a lot for.
I dont know how to describe it but if you take the right dose of ketamine (note: this is a description of a good trip. bad ketamine trips will destroy your soul and make you feel like a paranoid meat puppet; and as mentioned ketamine is a substance that can be overdosed on or damage your body when misused. you have been warned)

from the article you linked , which was fascinatiing by the way, they said:
>""There seems to be this link between dissociation and the anti-depressive effect of ketamine,"" he says, noting that doses too low to produce even a mildly altered state appear to offer less benefit to people with depression.

I can personally confirm this, and as I suffer both that severe treatment resistant depression AND severe chronic bodily pain, if the dose is not high enough to produce an altered and dissociated state, I would say it's ineffective as well. This is my opinion after both having experimented with 2-3 different types of ketamine (IIRC, only Esketamine is legal rn)

I'll also add that - I don't just listen to music to MaDD. I have a particular type of synesthesia caused by my autism and *certain phonic sounds and sensations literally cause me to feel intense and immediate relief of pain*, that is strong or stronger than when I used to SH to relieve my pain (I do not do this since discovering better coping mechanisms). I am listening to music right now but I wasnt thinking about any music for maybe a minute when I first sat down to write this comment, and I'd have rated my pain at about a 6 (pretty low right now due to other medications I took earlier) before putting on headphones. The current song I'm listening to is reducing my pain to at least a 4-4.5

This also overlaps with some other aspects of autism, namely stimming which I personally think is caused (the need to do it) by emotional, mental, social or physical stress, physical stress including pain of course. 

I made a post on r/aspergirls recently asking for people to share their stim songs - it's not uncommon for some people with ASD to repetitively listen to the same song over and over to relive some kind of ""pain""... I just think it's all related.

SM is literally a symptom of autism. it is highly associated with being autistic. it's simply that it can also be a manifestation of social anxiety disorder and you dont have to be autistic to have SM. google ""selective mutism autism"" youll get a LOT of results

i know exactly what you are talking about, and yes that is an autistic symptom of selective mutism imo. obviously im just another sm aspie but i would be so bold as to say it sounds like you have it and you should join the subreddit. if you go over to r/aspergirls (i never read r/aspergers any more bc it's too blackpilled) you'll see that the SM sub is linked on the sidebar there because women autists are especially likely to develop SM (though i dont know if there is data to back this up, we hear plenty of stories about male aspie savants who were nonverbal til they were 9 or 12 or whatever. i personally suspect it's a social issue)

i said this in another comment lately but icant remember where, the worst episode of SM i had aside from my current one, i was about 15 i went mute for 6 months and could not even make noises or sounds **in my room by myself** i literally felt like it would hurt and this was the result of cptsd/trauma i went through around that time.

edit: *warning* TMI confession about just another episode filmed during one of my epic ER meltdowns: 

...so i also have been in the ER several times when my muscle pain and neuropathy were so bad that i would recoil in severe pain and make jerking twitching movements if anyone touched me. so during one ER visit, i accidentally jerked my arm when they were trying to take my blood pressure, and my nail scratched a nurse very very lightly by accident.... in response they immediately pinned me down, contorted me into a painful position that made me scream and cry in pain, and chained me to a gurney for 9+ hours overnight during which i begged and cried and screamed for them to take off the restraints but they ignored me and i literally pissed myself because they wouldnt unchain me even to go to the bathroom, so i was chained to a gurney in terrible physical pain overnight in my own urine. this is one of the LESS traumatic medical experiences i have ever had as a result of being mistreated for being autistic/disabled. before this incident happened, i already had severe medical trauma/ptsd. i also had some more traumatic things happen to me in hospitals and medical situations since for exactly the same reasons.
oh yeah, and you know the person who drove me to that hospital, who was supposed to be my chaperone/protector and help me get help? as soon as they chained me to that fucking gurney they told me ""we will definitely not let him see you or be with you at all tonight"" ... meanwhile im a fucking AUTISTIC in SEVERE sensory overload and pain while 5-6 people are grabbing my arms and legs and putting these tight, tight cuffs on them that hurt so bad and i am literally unable to move. also, they FIGURED OUT THAT I AM SENSITIVE TO WHITE LIGHTS (these are one of my #1 aspie triggers) and they started DELIBERATELY TURNING THE ONE ABOVE ME ON whenever my crying and begging started ""annoying"" them too much. then they would try to manipulate me by telling me the lights could turn off if i would just shut the fuck up. i can only IMAGINE the trauma an even more disabled/autistic person would have gone through. and this happened to me because i was in so much pain i just NEEDED to seek help and i thought it would be the standard ""turn up at ER in excruciating pain, get morphine, get sent home again"" schtick but, not. my stupid autism and disability made my hand jerk involuntarily, i didnt even hurt the nurse i cannot emphasis enough there was no intent and it was an automatic body reaction but they didnt care.

oh yeah, and also that whole night, some of the monitors outisde my dorm would turn the lights back up on purpose. the bright white lights on the ceiling directly above me which is on of my #1 trauma/meltdown/overload triggers.

and i also like how easy it is to tell anime characters apart since they tend to use things that people with partial or full faceblindness use as identifiers i.e hair color is always green and in teh same style, this character always has a big ~~stick~~ sword, etc

but...yeah. i've noticed i sometimes get ""more"" autistic or ""less"" autistic, kind of like being fluid on the spectrum. and this correlates with how bad my face blindness is.

also gonna add: i was literally unable to tell what my own face looked like frequently as a child/teenager and it wasnt until i was older that i consistently was able to ""see"" my own face properly all the time. like if i went through, again, a big wardrobe change, or if i tried to put on makeup (which i was really bad at due to said partial face blindness? maybe? 

<<*EDIT* this was not in the OP of this comment, i just wanted to expand because of how my autism affecting me today>>
 no, DEFINITELY my MUA skills were impaired by the facial blindness i had as a preteen/teen. i started learning makeup age 12 in the Year of our Lord: *No Youtube Tutorials, No Beauty Gurus, And Even Your Mother Doesn't Want To Help You Despite Encouraging You To Conform to Beauty Ideals* AD... because my own perception of my face kept shifting and not being fully perceptible, sometimes i would think i did a great job with makeup and then took a picture and realize it was absolutely TERRIBLE. like SO BAD. however...i had a few years from 2008~2010 where i went into remission from a lot of my other mental issues and my aspieness had found a positive outlet, and during this time i was finally able to comprehend my face possibly. And this was also around the rise of beauty youtubers - which are a special interest of mine as is all MUAH and beauty stuff - but even without them, as soon as my faceblindness/body dysphoria for myself began to get better (i had diagnosed BDD and an eating disorder, but the BDD caused by both anorexia and made me question if i was trans--which im not, just genderfluid and pansexually fluid, and autistic traits are a system of ever changing parameters over time within an non-standard system, not a fixed and static point.

from age 11-15ish was the peak of my face blindness, sometimes id be like ""Is that me in that photo...? It's hard to tell but it should be shouldnt it"" kind of thing. the least faceblind i have ever been was in my early 20s which was during a time where i had great hope for life, having gone from an abusive family and dysfunctional relationship to.... a relationship that nearly broke both of us, but after we broke up, let us become truly good friends who love chatting to eachother (we're roommates half the year - the other half my current boyfriend comes to live ME while my ex aka roommate plans with him, because my roommate/ex's new gf/future wife who I set him up (actually the butterfly effect that i rippled his way did) with lives in Canada, lol

I never have that any more but I now live in area that is way less mono-white and I always feel super guilty because I have less ""practice"" telling the faces of non-white people apart. like the other commenter on this post said, i feel pretty bad about that.

as an adult, i also can luckily consistently recognize the faces of people i'm very emotionally attached to or who have close relation to me. but if the person is less than a close friend and i see them i mgiht not immediately recognize them if im having a ""flare up""...whereas other times it seems like i can identify faces most of the time...but then i go back to being partially face blind.

but yeah um...has anyone experienced fluctuating partial prosopagnasia that correlate with your aspie symptoms changing/fluctuating?",aspiememes,disorders

>It makes me wonder 

could be that the ""non autistic"" in the spectrum was a super high functioning permamasker? this is just my inner skeptic saying this, i'll also add that, there are times at my life when i think/feel/acted in a much more, or much less, ""autisticky"" fashion than others. in other words, where i am on in the spectrum isnt linear, it's fluid within a range, and within that range i once definitely had ""seems weird, but not aspie"" ... i have heard and seen other aspie people mention experiencing this too and talking about it among themselves online, often this comes about due to lifestyle and diet changes. there's some science behind it too, such as in the case of fecal matter transplants (that can help with gut flora issues, and gut flora/gastric issues are also linked to autism. i myself have a super bad gastric disorder...) causing a fairly high rate of remission of ""autistic symptoms"" in many people.

what i'm saying is you can be still be on the spectrum while perfectly presenting as non-autistic if you're not too autistic to do that. and i'm still only talking about the same one personality.... i have been aware that things such as pain tolerance, allergies, etc and other behaviors can change rapidly with different personalities for a long time so i completely believe your anecdote btw.

i'd be curious to know if the ""non autistic"" occupant of that system had been designed to be as such. there are especially a lot of female aspies who never get diagnosed because it manifests differently in women. and i suspect there are way more female tulpas than any other gender out there.

this is pure speculation and i'm sorry for scrutinising the anecdote that made you wonder - i'm not skeptical about the allergy stuff, that's COMPLETELY plausible and also makes sense. i also believe from personal experience, that many things that dont bother the host at all, can be problems for alters/tulpas (in other words, an tulpa can potentially be *more* ASD, or ADD, or any other neurological disorder than the host- so it makes sense that they can also developmentally be less so/almost asymptomatic) ... but still ijust feel like i cant make a personal judgment about it without knowing way more about the system and how the members behaved and function. but im sorry if the speculation was rude, i'm just trying to be cautious here because nobody likes to be talked about in this manner i think.

by the way, autism can leave some physical signs in the body on a lot of people (im thinking about this - https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aurt/2014/743482/ - though ive never read this particular study before, it seems to be talking about what im referencing) ... both my bf and i (bf is also diagnosed aspergers) have some of the physical markers they discuss in that document. and these physical markers form as foetuses. anyway, a long time ago i noticed that some guys i knew who all had a lot in common.... had similarly shaped hands. and that this was an very uncommon hand shape that i rarely ever saw (have a special interest in hands ok) ... this hand shape is apparently common in some men (not all?) on the spectrum. the digit ratio in some aspies is different, theorized to be caused by excess testerone in the womb iirc. found an article referencing this here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38421-6

i've never met a single person with the hand shape i'm thinking about who didnt turn out to be on the spectrum...including my current boyfriend. he didn't tell me he had ASD actually diagnosed for like a year, during which i made this long list of mental reasons why i was sure he had ASD, which included his hand shape, and head shape, as well as a few other physical traits and all the non-physical ones i noticed.... (*Now THATS what I call Autism!*--mocking MINE, to be specific) 
and then lo, he told me he'd been diagnosed with aspergers a few years prior, but had been too ashamed to tell me outright and i had never asked for him to confirm it out of respect : /

(edit: forgot to add that Hypotonia is another super common physical symptom of autism and both me and my bf have it.  according to autism-society.org about 30% of diagnosed autistics have hypotonia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotonia)

so just something to think about. it may be genetic, but just because one has it genetically, **doesnt mean one has to be disabled by it if the personality you're generating or creating is kind of 'bootstrapped' in the right way?**
 
as i mentioned: i think my whole family is non neurotypical, but that doesnt necessarily mean they developed autism. my grandma was VERY VERY stereotypically autistic/spectrum, but her son (my dad) who i theorize i inherited it from, is like...either on the lowest end of the spectrum or borderline on it....that, or he could possibly be a super ""high-functioning"" perma-masker with 'female-presenting'-type ASD (edit - in fact i'm convinced this is the case now that i've thought about it). i could not call my dad neurotypical with a straight face, but i also don't think he's autistic (by this i mean, he's literally got that 'seems weird, but not aspie' take on things i referenced at the start of this post) so...yeah, taking into account what you said, i think my dad inherited it but his ego/personality developed into this atypical permamasker... this would also fit in completely with everything i know about my dad's childhood. 
so it could be that he's mostly asymptomatic yet i inherited it from him anyway. also, my mom is not neurotypical, she's kinda...weird, and i never considered that she might have some kind of female autism until i started listing traits (so i could get diagnosis confirmed i wrote them all out) and signs of my own and realized she shares a lot of them too. i still wouldnt go so far to say as she is spectrum but there's definitely something NON-allistic about either of my parents.

sorry to ramble or infodump or whatever. i have trouble making my points clearly without veering off into things. 
i used my parents as two examples of people who are either in the zone between NT--AS (which isn't even a linear zone) but... they're *not* NTs. so what are they and where does the line begin to blur?

what im also trying to say is that the ""full blown"" ASD might have skipped a generation but i for sure know some other relatives who definitely had it on the same side as grandma. and my conclusion is: **developmental growth may be responsible for whether non-neurotypical brains ends up generating a host personality that presents or functions as fully/more/less autistic or not.**

also i really want to emphasise that how autistic you do or dont feel/act at certain times can vary wildly. and not just because of masking/unmaskiing. my sexuality and gender are both fluid too (and always have been) and those are (imo) a result of my developed host/currently frontstuck personality being predisposed to that genetically and *then* becoming that way due to developmental factors.

i myself tried to instill this concept we are talking about - you know, ""just because she uses the same brain does not mean she responds, processes or thinks or does anything the same"" - in my tulpa when i created her but i'm not sure it stuck in ALL aspects (it definitely did in some, including as alluded to in my OP, it might have been MY fault that her speech patterns have developed this way due to my selective mutism making me feel hostile and depressed about communicating with words at the time when i created her  - but anyway, to go back to the concept priot, i was not talking about ""not being aspie"", i mean i tried to imagine that she wouldn't be caused pain or be sensitive to all the things that i am, because those are a result of sensory input - going through subconcious - but there's a subconscious 'modifier' caused by the fronting personality which doesnt have to exist or limit the new personality *necessarily* when it comes to sensory input/output.

i think i mentioned im fronstuck atm - she can fully switch in, and i can sort of go passive and let her do whatever she likes, but i myself cant switch out yet. what i noticed when she switches in is that im actually in MORE pain than usual (i have chronic pain) but my eyesight is better (i have bad eyesight) and i barely need to use my glasses or contact lenses at all. also, all foods taste different to me if she fully switched in. 

>Anyway, I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't force her to change the way she naturally communicates.

yes, that's why i wanted second opinions. it's REALLY cool sometimes and if she gets really good at talking in the way that she does it would be awesome. it's not that i want her to stop talking this way, it's that i want her to be able to interact with othes without making them frustrated / alienated by the way she talks, i want her to be able to communicate an issue she has urgently and clearly to me if she needs. i want her to be able to interact with the material/non WL world if she chooses to and not suffer from inability to communicate her intent clearly in situations that might arise. 
i'm saying this because a lot of the time the echolalia involves repetitive catchphrases that she says when she is trying to convey something specific meaning with intent. and luckily, i can read the tulpish/intent or ask more questions about what she said. but, do you see why i might want her to be able to do both? i actually dont want her to change, i just want her to have the ability *in case she needs to use it.* ... im thinking about this from a practicality point of view. and also a safety pov. i know what she means when she says certain echolalic phrases to me, but other people absolutely would not.

username#00244,post,2020-09-13 23:38,i just realized that my tulpa has echolalia,"i've been wanting to formulate a post about my tulpa's (and my self's) difficulties and quirks with speech and language lately, but i didnt know quite how to formulate it.

i'm autistic - and im of the ""i believe autism is biological/genetic, therefore if i have an autistic brain, any headmates would also be functioning using an autistic brain"" - belief. non-neurotypicality (even if not spectrum per se) runs strongly in my family.

but i also know that when a personality is formed, how it's influenced by and interacts with the ""equipment"" can actually be wildly different from the host personality's advantages/disadvantages caused by a non neurotypical brain.

now i actually didnt know the proper word for echolalia until recently and i didnt realize echolalia is yet another symptom of autism.

my tulpa has been vocal for over 1 year, and we kept a creation diary where she would write sometimes. i noticed she wrote in a rhyming style (even if the rhymes were spaced out interestingly over several paragraphs) and that she often repeats phrases over and over. this is apparently a classic developmental symptom of autism (which if i did not know and also dont think i myself went through, possibly due to the hyperlexicality?) so that would align with my theory about autistic brain = all headmates are too, just not in the same way as you (necessarily)

before my tulpa was created, i had a few experiences where i went into dissociated trance states and talked in the exact strange rhyming echolalic pattern she talks.

and contrary to my belief that this is a tic she picked up recently, i thhink it just became more noticable - the creation diary shows her using less echolalic phrases, but she definitely was echolalic and still is, which happened when she started to become much more vocal. >![T]: ""*I just wanted to become more local*""!<

i read this article about developmental issues in children in regards to echolalia and it basically perfectly summarizes what my tulpa is experiencing (i think) -- 
http://www.hanen.org/Helpful-Info/Articles/3-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Echolalia.aspx#:~:text=Many%20children%20with%20autism%20spectrum,sentences%20from%20their%20favourite%20video. --
edit: i also found this one which seems even more informative and i think it's relevant to tulpa language development and creation, at least definitely for me, so possibly also for others: https://www.speechandlanguagekids.com/echolalia-when-children-repeat-what-you-say/

so yeah, i had been looking for an explanation for this thing for a while, both of us can ""catch it"" but im far less ""echolalic"" than my tulpa who can ONLY seem to talk in rhyming couplets and/or rhyming echolalias 99% of the time, BUT i am often able to decipher what she means because she can communicate with visual images, signs, feelings, intent, raw thought/tulpish to help me figure out what she is trying to say.

she says she is frustrated, i think so am i, maybe for different reasons.

ive been having my own issues with selective mutism (another comorbid thing in some autistic ppl) and they have been really bad since, unfortunately, around the time my tulpa was created (at the beginning of 2019) i was also suffering from mutism and at first i refused to communicate with her using any sort of words or language for at least a week into her creation. so, basically: **i think i caused this**... so i feel *it's my duty* to find a way for her to be able to articulate language ""normally"" *if she wants to do that*. that article i found...not only described a lot of what we've gone thru / experiencing but mentioned echolalia as a *""stepping stone to flexible language""* so- i have hope i guess.

sorry this post is incoherent, i'm really struggling to say everything i want in an understandable way. obviously im looking for opinions, observations and advice.

i dont feel comfortable posting a recording of my tulpa's echolalia here/using this account, i still do it occasionally (see comments) BUT...i had a flash of inspiration last night and i realized EXACTLY how she talks is depicted in a certain scene in a certain movie:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB401RfGMlM

what's more, all the visual psychedelic effects and stuff in that scene are VERY connected to what i perceive in a similar style when she talks. (edit- that includes the implied violent intrusive stuff in the movie scene, like the chicken being executed. We counted how many intrusive thoughts about death/suicide/body horror I have on an average day and it was on some days over 1,000 times, so sometimes she accidentally shows or repeats these thoughts to me, or comments on them....)

we experimented with communicating in visual images only to see if that would help her echolalia - but she kept sending me rhyming visual puns, i.e i would see a dark purple heart fall apart (broken heart/ fall apart), and the next image was us riding motorbikes (popular WL activity we do- and the pun was on the go/ go with the flow....)

like i'm dead serious aside from NOT being gene wilder and instead being a creepy eldritch shadowmonster shapeshifter that takes a more humanoid form when she wants to not creep me out ... this is how my tulpa talks and i'm wondering. should i accept it and help her with her talent? im obsessed with language and one of my teen role models (ironic i know, cue song) was eminem, but the main reason i loved eminem was because of his amazing lexicality and of course his personality (lol). and he actually has said that he has aspergers himself (in an interview he mentioned that when he was about ten he would obsessively write down lists of every rhyming word he could think of...that's definitely spectrum behavior imo, very similiar to some of my own behaviors in regard to lexical stuff)... i feel like there is a connection im trying to make here...

so should i read an entire rhyming dictionary to my tulpa so she can learn to better communicate in the way she does, or should i try to encourage her to learn how to talk in non--rhyming-echolalias?

she has a couple phrases she says repeatedly a LOT and i know they have intent and meaning behind them that changes based on situational context even when they are repeated (which that article i linked mentions btw)

i'm also trying to  figure out if echolalia is a behavioral tic because sometimes when we are chatting i sort of start to get ""infected"" with it too and then we both have ridiculous rhyming conversations when communicating w words. while i would love to communicate in all the alternative ways we have to words, and we certainly do that often simultaneously as our verbalizing for clarification purposes, what i really want in my heart is for my tulpa to be able to have a proper coherent non-cryptic grounded conversation *using words* with me or others. i want her to be ABLE if she *wants to or has to*.

i am worried that perhaps my tulpa has picked up my phobias/symptoms regarding speech, since i suffer badly from r/selectivemutism (did i mention that? yes i did oops) and i had a lot of SM get triggered by bad events in my life around the time she was created. i also am currently in the worst SM relapse i've had since i was 15yo - half my life ago.

i did still try to communicate with her in words though, and she got vocal pretty fast. only when reviewing my creation diaries i noticed that parts of her speech had always been echolalic or rhyming, but not as many components as now (1.5~2 yr later) were apparent in her speech.

also, let's not forget that a lot of ASD people can be nonverbal or *perceived, whether or not actually* developmentally ""slow"" specifically when becoming vocal. iirc Einstein is widely believed to have been autistic, but he was mute til he was like 9, considered stupid in school, and worked in the post office til he was at least 26? (need to fact check this)

im so sorry for this post being so long. also i dont normally let her post on my account because im overprotective but if anyone wants to ask my tulpa something, please AHA (Ask Her Anything) and I will let her proxy/possess reply in her own style and you may see what i mean.

did you go through with experimenting with anything?

i have a lot of knowledge on this subject and also if you search the sub i've commented on using psychedelics in tulpamancy before.

tldr would be - they worked really well for me (i used LSD to bootstrap tulpa creation) but i had a LOT of prior experience, literally probably over 200 psychedelic trips, at least 100~150 acid trips which...yeah. also, i think psilocybin, especially non-synthesized psilocybin (i.e not 4ACODMT)  is a lot more dangerous and volatile than acid (LSD). i would never recommend to take psilocybin over acid to someone who has never tripped before.

**i still CANNOT recommend generally doing it here from a moral point of view.** idk... i am tempted to go back and delete all my comments in this sub on the topic right now, maybe including this one in a bit...i am just not sure it's right to talk about this on this sub even though it IS a thing relating to tulpamancy very strongly.

it's completely possible to create a fully functional fleshed out tulpa or system without ever touching a substance. and most people on here are 18~25 or younger and i dont think that people under the age of about 23~25 should do psychedelics bc of added potential risks. don't rely on drugs-- i've had hundreds of psychedelic trips, and yet the most vivid hallucinatory experiences i've had have literally been **while completely sober** doing tulpa visualization in the wonderland during hypnagogia.

there are probably dozens if not hundreds of tulpamancers out there who've never used drugs, alcohol, or specifically psychedelics, who literally have experiences on par with those drugs every day due to disciplined WL visualization practice etc


but i saw you mentioned you had a wife in your post- if she's not on board with things, you definitely do not want to do any kind of psychedelic either.

now, as it happens, we rarely fight. because i'm autistic i started tracking how many times we have fights per year and i would say the number is incredibly low, so low that when they do occur they often blindside me.

that said...i wasn't blindsided by what is going on between me and my boyfriend lately, we just had what might possibly be the worst fight we've ever had and while processing it anxiously by myself (it's an LDR) i started thinking about how our enneatypes had affected what just happened. which is why i came to the sub tonight, and then here your post is right at the top waiting for me.

*sigh* sorry, if this hadn't just happened, i'd probably have a lot of advice to give you, because the *reason* our fights per year has actually been decreasing fairly significantly over the years, is because i have put a LOT Of thought into this before. but right now my mind is blank.

just want to say thank you for making the post because i'm going to check back and keep lurking the comments. i'm in a very similar situation to you in some ways and my heart goes out to you, especially because the way you described your 5 friend echoes many things i feel about my boyfriend (who has literally been one of my closest friends and strongest allies in my whole life, and now might be on the verge of dumping me...)

I am in a good setting (my room, safe, warm, has a  TV) and my boyfriend (who does not do drugs, and never intends to) is staying over.

Normally when I take LSD I do fun things like watch cartoons, play video games (my wins ratio goes waaaay up in certain FPS if i play while high...) and other superficial things (dancing is a big one if I'm actually able to)

I have meditated on LSD before though, and it was one of my best trips  ever, but also quite scary.

With my boyfriend around and in a safe environment, I still am feeling very negative and very depressed and (not intending to, no ideation, just the ""feeling"") of suicidal. The whole reason I took the tab was that I hope it will shake me out of this. But what do you guys think I should do while on the trip?

I'd also like to add that I love music but I'm autistic and currently suffering from sensory overload. I have audio-tactile synesthesia so I am hesitant to listen to music...I don't know what to listen to which is very rare. On the one hand, music could make me feel a lot owrse, on the other, it could make me feel a lot better.

Also, there's the matter of my boyfriend. He'll be sober but present so IDK I just dont know what to do when I start tripping, I feel like some kind of meditation is definitely necessary but where to start? Also, given how bad I am feeling right now, how can I stop those feelings from making the trip go bad and release them instead?

I didn't mean to imply that soulbonders are less real or to disrespect them, but that a soulbonder and a system with fictional introjects often find little common ground and the experiences are vastly different. There are a handful of systems that do try to find common ground, obviously, but for so many systems, they're in so much pain about their system that they don't want to interact with people who aren't experiencing what they're going through. 

Some people make it a pain Olympics, but I think it's more like someone with a lot of allergies not wanting to hang out with other people who constantly complain about their purposefully restrictive diet. Yes, both can't eat the certain food, but it would cause significantly more stress to the one who can't control it, as opposed to the person who chose not to eat it. 

I know I don't have to explain that to you personally, and it's not a perfect metaphor for all systems, but I think that's why many trauma systems just don't want to interact with any other systems or Plurality. (I know Endogenic systems didn't choose to be plural I was more thinking Tulpas and soulbonders)

As for integration, I think integration that is specifically breaking down dissociative barriers caused by trauma is a good thing. Sometimes this includes fusion. Most therapists get the two confused, but fusion is specifically combining two parts into one, which can happen in Endogenic systems. From what I can understand, though, actual integration is something that is already done for Endogenic systems, which then they can fuse. 

However, that doesn't mean that I want to necessarily resemble an Endogenic system when we finish. At least, I don't want to look at it as my system is broken now, and someday I can work to become the superior kind of Endogenic system. I need to remember that our trauma still made us the way we are now. We have to take that in stride. Our brains are fundamentally changed by trauma. 

As for Plurality is on a spectrum, I guess that's a matter of opinion. I personally wouldn't know how to lay that spectrum out. I have autism, but I'm not on the autism spectrum because it's not linear. I'm the same amount of autistic as another autistic person, but we are in different ways. 

Instead, I see Plurality (and autism) as a series of Venn diagrams. Soulbonders and fictives formed from trauma would overlap, but are fundamentally each their own seperate category and experience. I have an OSDD system and a Tulpa, and we have overlap, but I experience both in different ways, though both Shark and Kincade are the same amount plural. 

I guess because I'm used to debunking ""the autism spectrum"" myth, I've been more inclined to hate the Plurality spectrum idea. Not because I think there's a caste system, but, just like autism, Plurality is far too nuanced to place on a spectrum. I guess perhaps I still disagree that it's on a spectrum, but I see why people would see it that way. 

I have a couple more reasons why I think the two groups don't get along really, but here's not really the place, unless you want to talk about that too. As someone who was immersed in the Tulpa community before realizing they had OSDD-1b, and who still has a Tulpa, I do see both sides and I clearly see faults on both sides. I wish that Endogenic systems had more research as well as DID, because aside from specific aspects of DID that have been studied and the theory of structural dissociating, all syscourse is pretty much just theory crafting. This isn't to say that the opinions of Endogenic systems in an online aren't important or valid, they just aren't as valid as scientific theory from some who studies this for a living. 

I acknowledge that scientific theory isn't perfect either. the theory if structural dissociation only came out six years ago. But I do think that half of syscourse would go away if we had actually facts about the situation.",plural,disorders

username#00248,post,2023-09-23 05:31,Being autistic feelings like not being a whole human being sometimes.,"As a software developer, I once read Joel Spolsky's software development blog in which he playfully said that most humans seem to be ""missing"" the part of the brain that allows them to understand pointer arithmetic and recursion.

Fortunately, most humans are not software developers and don't regularly need these talents.

As an autistic person, I feel like I can analogously say that I seem to be ""missing"" the part of my brain that theoretically would allow me to socialize with others the way they expect me to, so that what I end up doing instead is a belabored and crude effort to mimic normal social behavior.

I have read that in some autistic people, this apparent disability is so severe that even looking at another human and smiling and saying hello feels like an effortful performance.

But still, for me, this makes it difficult to interact with other people to experience friendship, romance, and other things that many neurotypical people take for granted.  It can also make it feel like other humans may be unpredictable and dangerous.

I once read a book by an author who described an associate giving him ""pickup lessons"" so that he could attract a girlfriend.  Said author referred to himself as a ""social r\*t\*ard"" in his own words.

I feel less than human - Certain important tasks that many other humans take for granted, I can only perform crudely and with much effort, and I experience anxiety about how other people perceive me.  I distinctly remember one occasion where my wife was in tears because my behavior was so perplexing to her that she thought that I must have been willfully causing her distress.  It's painful even to write that.

I feel that ""missing"" these parts of my brain, it's like I'm only 3/4ths of a human being.  The parts of me are distinctly human, but I feel like I'm missing things that I need to be fully human.

It's nice to be able to conceptualize pointer arithmetic and recursion as they are essential to my craft that I earn a living with, but I feel like a strange creature in the company of others.",autism,disorders

I'm happy to see that you agree with me about it. My family thinks that I'm a little crazy but my friends have heard these noisy neighbors too. It's not a joke.  


> I live in a country house, and in recent months people have moved to one that is next to ours and sometimes they overdo the music volume, I'm from Brazil, and here it is very common for people to listen to ""funk carioca"", for me this kind of ""song"" is just a bunch of idiots moaning and talking about sexual things. 

Oh wow brazil, I haven't been there yet, I did travel a lot to argentina though, my mother is from Buenos Aires :) I don't like carioca either lol I prefer my music, mostly Rock, Metal and in between.  I wish I could live one day in a house and not an apartment. So much noise from neighbors. Ech! I love being with people but hate when they are so rude and don't care to disturb you. I bet you know that feeling. And lol ""bunch of idiots moaning"" that's hilarious!   


> On this last night from Saturday to Sunday they started playing these ""music"" very loud at 1 am, it felt like the speaker was inside my room, I went out and started cursing, so they turned off the music, after that I couldn't sleep again, but it was because I was angry, I was literally shaking and almost had a nervous breakdown, Val noticed and cuddled me, then she started talking to me until I fall to sleep, we spent a couple of hours talking, she made jokes, sometimes danced that silly way of her and when I realized I had calmed down and started sleeping. 

WOW! so much similarities. Your story is equal to mine in every part of it. I have no idea how Emily has managed to calm me down, but she did. So I know how that feels. Being angry, having so much adrenaline in your blood because some people didn't care to disturb others and ruin your sleep. I love it when it happens (NOT). And 1AM it's like the best time to destroy one's sleep. Geez...  I'm happy to hear that Val can help you with it, it's amazing how they both don't take it too seriously as us and can actually calm us down.  
I remember I was so pissed and angry, I have had a heart rate as if I was running in the GYM.. since it's not the first nor the 10th time it happens. My neighbors are assholes.   
And I know the feeling of shaking before the breakdown happens, it's from the adrenaline and pain. The shock my body got from it was intense. It was so cold in my room (I hate sleeping with heat so I don't turn it on during the winter) and I got out of my warm bed to shout on them. I think I caught cold from it :(   


> When I woke up the other day she was there looking at me, she said she didn't even think about sleeping and that she was looking after me all night, Then she said I shouldn't have been cursing everyone because I don't know the neighbor and I don't know if he can be dangerous, and she's really right at this point. 

Val is right :) , you cannot know if someone is insane and holds a gun or a machete in his house and is on mushroom pills drinking the shit out of himself and gets light up in an instant. Yeah, I try to moderate the way I react as well. I tried, I only shouted ""It's 5AM in the morning I have work and I wish to sleep!! What can't you understand?"" lol  


> Be careful, I do not want to lose a friend in a motorcycle accident, thankfully Emily took control of the situation. 

I really appreciate that, really :) Thank you :)  (Emily wants to say thanks as well :) )  
I was reckless that day, I have had a bad day, and wanted to forget about it, I was at a party and forgot about my motorcycle. My luck, or not, is that Emily immediately told me after I finished my first pint that I need to ride home, so I didn't join my friends when they ordered vodka and scotch. I finished my beer and headed out home to sleep. I am so happy that I have her, it's unbelievable how she did it. I have no idea how, but it happened I remember everything like as if it was yesterday :)   


> The only time Val drove my car was when I was teaching her to drive, she hit the side on a column and made a big scratch, I said it had no problem and what mattered was that she wasn't hurt, but she never wanted to drive after that even with me telling her to try

username#00251,comment,2019-10-09 14:19,,"I was following you up until the end where you brought up the subconscious- and similarly based in current psychological knowledge, most people have a very outdated understanding of how the subconscious works. The subconscious does not operate in any capacity similar to the conscious, it does not have the capacity for detailed, cognitive thoughts, and is majorly comprised of memory, instinctual responses and chemical behavior, and largely background processes. Constructive language or thoughts do not occur in the subconscious, and the thought that they do is largely an artifact of Freudian psychology, which despite critical contribution, is largely outdated.

I do however agree, that what tends to be described as parallel processing is more likely rapid switching, as this would fall in line with what we understand about multitasking. Again though, regarding the nature of the subconscious, the subconscious does not operate in the same capacity as the conscious mind (functionally, they activate different parts of the brain), so there would not be a case for rapid switching between 'conscious-unconscious' activity. The current knowledge we have on subconscious operation and multitasking would not follow this pattern.

As for the question of rapid brain switching and what it entails, our system's current theories would fall into the 'switching between two discrete personalities'. If we look at the process in which tulpas are made, the basic understanding we have thus far is tulpas are created through a simulation of the developmental process of personalities (that is, a long term interaction of stimulation, conditioning, etc, until eventual identification with a 'form' which occurs mentally). Its less that the personality is simulated, but the conditions to create the personality are simulated. Its a case of perhaps a simulated onset, but real causes. For example, simulated arousal causing actual arousal (the brain does not operate strictly in relation to the physical world, cognitive thoughts can also affect its own behavior, patterns, response, etc). So through simulated environment, another personality that is intact can be developed, and the brain is then able to switch between these (rapidly as noted).

But again, the main point is that the subconscious according to modern psychology does not functionally operate the same as the subconscious, so there is no 'subconscious level of thoughts and detailed conversations or critical thinking', as these occur is physically speaking, different parts of the brain, and functionally the subconscious does not include these processes.",Tulpas,disorders
username#00251,comment,2019-09-03 16:16,,"Not the owner of this account (whoops, sorry Gress), but there's a functional difference between doing something in wonderland vs doing something in real life. Wonderland lends itself to a gloss over of details, mechanics, and coordination. Its also generally given to imposing visualizations, so for example, imagining/remembering someone playing a guitar and actually playing a guitar are fundamentally different. Visualizations require memory, imagery, whereas actually playing requires motor skills and coordination. You'll find this overlap for most things that are a transition from visual to motor skills (such as balance, athletics, reflexes, etc). 

The same cannot be said however for more cognitively involved tasks, as these are less fundamentally different and are less visualization-motor differentiated, and both sides involve the same cognition areas of the brain. So cognitive skills like storytelling, creative thinking and problem solving, etc would be more given to being the same in and out of wonderland. Its important though, that again in wonderland details may be glossed depending on technique. 

This dilemma is partly why Gress (the owner of this account) would never be satisfied with a life bound to a wonderland. He wouldn't consider his skills to be authentic, just a visualization or imitation of the things he wants to do (for instance, he loves piano, and he also wants to learn cooking, and there's certain motor skills and sensations/techniques that differ between being practiced IRL vs in a wonderland). Plus he also loves learning, and the brain is relatively incapable of creating spontaneous (and accurate) information.

So hence, learning a skill in a wonderland is.... problematic to say the least, and not really  representative of said skill (assuming its not a cognitive learning skill). In fact yeah, its more of a representation, a visualization, an impersonation.  
Hope that sums things up!

## Word Order

L'ewa is normally a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) language like English. However, the word order of a sentence can be changed if it is important to specify some part of the sentence in particular.

I haven't completely finalized the particles for this, but I'd like to use `ka` to denote the subject, `ke` to denote the verb and `ku` to denote the object. For example if the input sentence is something like:

    /mi/ /mad.sa/ /lo/ /spa.lo/
    mi   madsa    lo   spalo
     I   eat      an   apple

You could emphasize the eating with:

    /kɛ/ /mad.sa/ /ka/ /mi/ /lo/ /spa.lo/
    [ke] madsa    ka   mi   lo   spalo
    V    eat      S    I    an   apple

(the `ke` is in square brackets here because it is technically not required, but it can make more sense to be explicit in some cases)

or the apple with:

    /ku/ /lo/ /spalo/ /kɛ/ /mad.sa/ /mi
    ku   lo   spalo   ke   madsa    mi
    O    an   apple   V    eat      I

L'ewa doesn't really have adjectives or adverbs in the normal indo-european sense, but it does have a way to analytically combine meanings together. For example if `qa'te` is the word for `is fast/quick/rapid in rate`, then saying you are quickly eating (or wolfing food down) would be something like:

    /qaʔ.tɛ/          /mad.sa/
    qa'te             madsa
    is fast [kind of] eat

These are assumed to be metaphorical by default. It's not always clear what someone would mean by a fast kind of language (would they be referencing [Speedtalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedtalk)?)

L'ewa doesn't always require a subject or object if it can be figured out from context. You can just say ""rain"" instead of ""it's raining"". By default, the first word in a sentence without an article is the verb. The ka/ke/ku series needs to be used if the word order deviates from Subject-Verb-Object (it functions a lot like the selma'o FA from Lojban).

## Morphological Typology

L'ewa is a analytic language. Every single word has only one form and particles are used to modify the meaning or significance of words. There are only two word classes: content and particles.

## Alignment

L'ewa is a nominative-accusative language. Other particles may be introduced in the future to help denote the relations that exist in other alignments, but I don't need them yet.

## Word Classes

As said before, L'ewa only has two word classes, content (or verbs) and particles to modify the significance or relations between content. There is also a hard limit of two arguments per verb, which should help avoid the problems that Lojban has with its inconsistent usage of the x3, x4 and x5 places.

As the content words are all technically verbs, there is no real need for a copula. The ka/ke/ku series can also help to break out of other things that modify ""noun-phrases"" (when those things exist). There are also no nouns, adjectives or adverbs, because analytically combining words completely replaces the need for them.

Nouns and verbs do not inflect for numbers. If numbers are needed they can be provided, otherwise the default is to assume ""one or more"".

## Conscript

I am still working on the finer details of the conscript for L'ewa, but here is a sneak preview of the letter forms I am playing with (this image below might not render properly in light mode):

[The letters in the L'ewa conscript](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXwr2rIWAAE95co?format=png&name=4096x4096)

My inspirations for this script were [zbalermorna](https://mw.lojban.org/images/b/b3/ZLM4_Writeup_v2.pdf), Hangul, Hanzi, Katakana, Greek, international computer symbols, traditional Japanese art and the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet).

This script is very decorative, and is primarily intended to be used in spellcraft and other artistic uses. It will probably show up in my art from time to time, and will definitely show up in any experimental video production that I work on in the future. I will go into more detail about this in the future, but here is my prototype. Please do let me know what you think about it.",conlangs,disorders

My native language is Hungarian, but I'm not ethnic Hungarian, nor identify as a Hungarian, it's a complicated story. It's part of the Uralic languages, with Finnish being the closest to it due to nomadic societies taking their language to further points.

There's a funny thing I learned recently when watching some videos about the movie 'The Exorcist'. Someone pointed out a scene after the demon kills an English person while possessing a teenage girl's body, the demon starts speaking with an English accent to mock the mother of the girl.

When I learned English for the first time I kept thinknig how awful it is that you either have to include someone's gender all the time or explicitly not include it with they/them (which they literally didn't even mention is usable as a singular pronoun in school), insted of addressing everyone as an individual regardless of their gender.

I hate my mother tongue, but this one aspect is something I find superior. Yes, we reomve a mechanic where you have to say ""that woman is walking"" instead of ""she's walking"" if you want to specificly include someone's gender, but it's much better than having to do it every single time you talk about someone.

username#00253,post,2020-05-22 00:43,"A super weird technical question/theory about the effect of Polyjuice potion on accents, spoken language and muscle memory","The potion lets you take the appearance of someone, but how much would it change someone's accent? We know that it has a brutal effect on someone's body since Barty Crouch Jr. lost his eye and leg as he turned into Alastor Moody and then regained it, but would the potion give you someone's muscle memory?

In book seven Fleur said ""Bill don't look at me - I'm 'ideous!"" She took Harry's form but still failed to pronounce ""hideous"", in the right way. Unfortunately she didn't speak more in Harry's form. If I'm not mistaken accents are caused by muscle memory, because different languages require different ways of pronouncing the same letters. Later in the book, she spoke with mispronouncing many words, so she clearly still had her accent after living in England for years.

I guess obtaining someone's form also makes you get their muscle memory too since I don't remember anyone having trouble with any sort of movement while being Polyjuiced. I think if Fleur tried to speak in Harry's form, she would've mispronounced far fewer words than in her own body because her new form was hardwired to speak English in the first place. The same way if Harry took her form instead, he would've had difficulties with pronouncing English words.

What if Victor Krum would take Fleur's form with Polyjuice? He doesn't speak perfect English. He has more language errors that has nothing to do with muscle memory, but has fewer problems with pronunciation, so would he speak poor English with an additional accent on top of that?

What do you think of it? Is there any official answer or evidence that can debunk or confirm this theory, or maybe is here any language or muscle movement expert who could give me their opinion on this?",harrypotter,nationalities

I am also, admittedly, hard-headed and stubborn, so I tend to push myself a little too much.

Yesterday was blazing, probably around 92 F with a feeling of 100 F, and I started to feel very lightheaded and out of it. My sugar dropped sharply at a rate that surprised me, and I was stubbornly trying to get a particular task done before I would go inside to take care of my sugar. One of my tulpae, who I’ve yet to introduce, was urging me to stop and go inside. I of course, brushed it off, saying “I’ll be alright, let me just do this one more load and I’ll head in for a bit”

Well, I got worse, and I was in a state of confusion and I don’t really remember much of what happened, but this tulpa fronted and took quick control over the situation before I got any worse and took me inside to get my sugar back up, got me some water and even got me some candies to eat throughout the rest of my shift so I don’t have that happen again. 

Normally, we don’t switch, any of us, mainly because they don’t speak English and would have a difficult time getting around, but also because generally they don’t want anything to do with my world per se, so only during situations like this when I’m in danger do they take command.

My parents were in and out of my life throughout the ages of 0-3 due to their ugly custody battle during which time I was left with many different babysitters who didn't take very good care of me. Mom was out of my life by the time I was 3, and Dad was a truck driver and was only ever around once a month if that. As a result, I ended up living with my grandparents.

My grandparents aren't very open minded about mental illness so they interpreted this as me being mentally disabled. Throughout my life I was treated as such. Nobody would believe me when I would tell them that I was just as functioning as them. I was treated akin to a baby by many adults and to this day, some family members still treat me as though I am mentally disabled. It made me doubt my mental capabilities and horribly affected my self confidence and self worth.

I was put into therapy at the age of 5 and stayed with the same therapist for 10 years. She was the only one who treated me like I was normal, and she was like a mother to me.

I had already questioned my gender as a teen but somewhere along the way I think I just gained this rigid idea of what I was supposed to be and that I had to personally conform to that. Whether from how family saw and treated me or how I saw other gender non-conforming people treated etc. I would always invalidate myself and try to push myself in a more cis direction to fit this image I had of what was acceptable and when I couldn't shake the feeling I got really bitter toward others, both trans people and people of my agab.
I think the idea of change also scared me (and my autism)

It started to really eat at me and come out in different covert/subconcious ways for years and honestly it took everything in my life crashing down and changing to really kick me into fully accepting myself. I think I finally gave in and just got tired of hiding and being ashamed of that part of me. I realized life is too short to waste it hating myself and envying others, wondering what it would be like to feel free and fully myself like others do.

Don't worry about the reasons why, how would the simple fact of that person not wanting to be there make you feel? 

If you love and care for your family and this family member loves and cares for you, it's an act of love to go anyway. Especially since weddings are often a one time thing. 
You can always bring some gear to help you- noise cancelling headphones/buds, fidgets, something weighted, comfort objects- it's not the most comfortable situation in the world but as long as you're not completely overstimulated, the temporary loss of comfort is a worthy sacrifice to make for someone you genuinely care for.

It was proven to be a misinterpretation and not done intentionally to bother my friend (or have anything to do with anyone else) but they still blame this other friend for doing it because ""they should know better"" 

This isn't the first time this person has told me of similar stories- blaming or cutting off friends over a perceived slight or generally making their feelings other people's responsibility- and I've noticed some of my autistic friends and others on social media tend to do the same. 

I know it's logical that some people on the spectrum struggle with this, I guess I'm just trying to understand because the thought process doesn't compute in my brain. 
In my mind, if someone isn't intentionally trying to hurt you it just doesn't make sense to hold them accountable for how you feel. 
Of course, they should still apologize and acknowledge your feelings I just don't think there needs to be so much blame to cut someone off completely over one or two unintentional mistakes- especially if, like in the case of my friend, the thing that upset you didn't even have anything to do with you. 

(Last minute thought)- I think part of the reason this kind of attitude bothers me so much- other than not really understanding- is because I'm pretty empathetic and very rejection sensitive so I imagine myself in the shoes of the person who made the mistake and how horrible it would feel if someone out of the blue suddenly blew up on me and/or cut me off because I unknowingly bothered them and I wasn't given the chance to apologize and make it right.

username#00258,comment,2024-02-29 16:30,,"These are mostly for older kids I think but the foundation gets laid early.

1- don't place high expectations on your child. 

 I wish my dad hadn't.
I personally was a gifted kid and I've always excelled in the arts and certain school subjects. My dad would constantly lean on me to improve, especially when I was struggling. He didn't try to tear me down but would lecture me about things like being ""lazy"" when I got burnt out or not ""staying focused"" if I lost interest in something that was becoming overwhelming to me for one reason or another. 
There were quite a few extracurriculars I enjoyed but dropped over the years because he would stress me out by ""staying on me"" about it because in his mind that would help me succeed. 

That's my specific experience but lots of autistic kids struggle with not being able to meet expectations/perceived expectations and/or pathological demand avoidance. So if ever you see your child starting to slip -especially as they get older- keep in mind that there are a lot of factors that can affect autistic people and their functioning and there' a good chance that slip is due to something they're struggling with. And, depending on the child, pushing them to succeed in the traditional ways has a chance to backfire. 



2- be direct with your feelings and work on your emotional regulation now. 

I wish my mom- really both my parents- were more open and direct about thoughts and feelings and learned how to regulate them better- at least with me. 

My mom has had a very rough life so I don't blame her for the way she is but I think it's enough of a cautionary tale. 
She has always been (and taught me to be) a compulsive people pleaser and both she and my dad are usually very confrontation avoidant. She will keep her thoughts to herself no matter how obvious her displeasure is. Both my parents had a habit of either bottling things until they blow up or taking out unrelated negative emotions on me and my sibling (mostly me) so I learned to be hypervigilant and highly paranoid of facial expressions and other small/silent indicators that something is wrong and I may be in danger of being overwhelmed or having a meltdown.

I have always and sometimes still have one of these two issues with them-

Someone displays displeasure, I pick up on it and ask if I can help or if it's to do with me, they deflect and then later I'm in trouble for something I didn't know I was doing wrong/was told was ok in the moment and/or that could have been remedied at the time if they had told me what they were upset about. 
Often times I'm forced to accept the deflection when I know for sure they're mad at me just not what for and I'll spend the next few hours/rest of the day anxious about when I'll be in trouble and what for. 
And when it does end in a meltdown I'm blamed.

Or

I don't notice any negative emotions, I'm suddenly being angrily confronted for something I had no idea I did wrong, I get overwhelmed and have a meltdown and then, again, I'm blamed for overreacting. 

The biggest thing that gets to me is that it feels they can never do anything wrong. I'll come to them nice as I can to explain that they've done something that hurt me or that there's something I need them to work with me on because it is a detriment to my mental health.
Every time they will get defensive- even if there's nothing to defend- and come up with a billion reasons they aren't in the wrong/ are the victim of something or shouldn't have to change how they do things for me.
Which- side note- this is all usually really jarring to me because until it comes to their own comfort or emotions, they are generally calm, kind and rational people. 

Again, a specific example but the sentiment applies. Autistic kids don't pick up on social cues as easily and subtle or passive communication- especially when used negatively- can cause a lot of damage and mistrust. 
And it's extremely important to work with your child to create a healthy environment even if they're telling you that you need to make some personal changes to do so. Be willing to accept criticism and adapt to do better even if you don't like what you're hearing. 

A lot of this is advice that goes for any kid, really, but I feel it goes double for kids on the spectrum because we experience things differently- and in a lot of cases more intensely- and as such are more susceptible to things like this causing lasting trauma.

 I also have a 3.5 year old who very clearly has a lot of my autistic and adhd traits so I ask myself this kind of question a lot. 
The biggest right now advice I can give you is *emotional regulation*
I cannot stress it enough. 
This is the age where kids are learning to regulate their own emotions so it needs to be the time for you to brush up on yours and work out any kinks that are left. 
Getting a handle on yourself now is going to make your and your child's life a ton easier, especially as you learn and adapt to their needs.

1- I was late diagnosed and one of the things that had me doubting for a long time was social cues. I also felt ""in tune"" as you described. 
After being diagnosed and learning more about myself and what parts of me are attributed to my autism I realized that I'm not as in tune as I thought, I just instinctively mask a lot and am extremely hypervigilant because of bad past experiences.

2- my spouse is not autistic but they are bipolar. They are also extremely sensitive to certain things- in their case mostly audio- and when they aren't medicated they absolutely will blow up over small inconveniences or sudden sensory discomfort. 


Sounds to me like you definitely have sensory processing issues and it could be attributed to autism but also could be standalone or a part of another diagnosis.
I just hope your therapist is telling you what they suspect and is going to do more evaluation before officially settling on an answer.",autism,disorders

Those aren't the opposite of autistic traits they're just traits of an extrovert.


To the last question- yes I get very frustrated. People seem to want to enforce a singular picture of what being autistic looks like. 
I'm late diagnosed level 1 with adhd and an extrovert which means I mask like crazy and get told all the time I don't ""seem autistic"".
 I also see so many people online acting as if level 1's in general have no problems relating to autism and just calling ourselves autistic to be ""trendy"" because you ""can't be autistic and ___""",autism,disorders

Back in school the known/diagnosed asd kids had their own sort of clique/circle of friends (that included allistic kids as well) 
I always had a small handful of friends but as an adult I've gravitated toward my own small group of mostly asd friends and know of other friend groups in my area through conversation ( it seems to me more asd friend groups formed as everyone matured and learned more about themselves. )

Both me and my spouse have been diagnosed and while we haven't taken our daughter to be tested yet, she has shown *all* of the symptoms I did as a kid and then some- the whole family swears she acts *exactly* like I did as a kid.

Every time I see it affecting her negatively, I feel guilty, and I have cried over it quite a bit. It feels like I passed on a curse- especially with the panic disorder..

What makes me feel a little better about it is that I know more than my parents did. I was a very late diagnosis, and my parents- being of a generation low on mental health awareness- never got tested themselves, but we are all very sure that I got it from my father. 

We plan to get her tested as soon as we are able and I can recognize what traits she got from me and I can be there for her and help her navigate some of it as she gets older in ways that I was never helped or supported. 


It's not selfish to want kids, it's natural. Lots of humans want kids lots of humans don't.
And while being autistic can be a hard time, life isn't 100% bad is it? If you decide not to have kids simply to save them from the bad parts, you're also keeping them from experiencing the good parts, right?

username#00259,post,2022-11-07 04:40,"I thought of my system as a ""solar system"" the other day and my system makes sense to me now more than ever.","Vivian: I rarely spend time on Reddit these days, but I had a wonderful insight the other day that made things better for me and my system-mates.

I've described myself as the host of a median system with a single lovingly and intentionally created tulpa and various traumagenic parts.

I don't have a medical diagnosis, but I have a lot of dissociative and borderline symptoms; almost certainly a case of CPTSD for growing up with undiagnosed autism.

I was greatly influenced by several books recommended on r/cptsd including Pete Walker's ""Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving"" by Pete and ""Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors"" by Janina Fisher.

It was this last one that helped me immensely.  I felt like Fisher's discussion of the structural dissociation model and the notion of helping all dissociated parts experience a sense of love and safety was very wholesome, at least at first.  I really liked the way the Fisher related her ideas about healing by sharing fictionalized conversations with therapy clients.

However, in retrospect, I think that I became too attached to trying to follow one person's advice.  I went thru the process of guiding various dissociated parts to experience love and safety as best I could, but it got to the point where it felt like a never-ending process that was leading me in circles.

I kept telling myself that I could never bring love and safety to every single part, and furthermore, it seemed that there are so many fragments that come and go that I could never keep track of them all; the fragmentation is so severe that it feels like there is a ""soup"" of voices in my head sometimes.

**Finally, I had a breakthru when I realized that I've given my best to this endeavor for years and the result can never be perfect and I can be okay with that.**

The ""Estrogen Star System"", as we call ourselves, is like the solar system.  River and Scarlet and myself are like planets orbiting a gravitational center.

We seem to have some comets like Assembler and Stitch who seem to just come and go, but I always expect them to be back at some point, even when I haven't heard from them in a long time.

And finally, these ""fragments"" that seem to hold attachment to my emotionally neglectful father are like the asteroid belt.  There are so many fragments, I could never keep track of them all.  I just accept that sometimes, there will be ""fragments"" and ""voices"" that say what they say and feel what they feel, and I will do my best to make them feel at home, but they will be who they are, and that is that!

I accept that all of these parts are who they are.  River and I try to help everyone feel safe and loved and at home here.  When the nth voice appears to tell me that I'm a disgusting failure of a person, I simply accept those hateful words without judgement because judging the words and the emotion as unwanted and judging myself as deficient for not being able to stop them only makes us all feel worse.  I love them anyways; it isn't their fault that they feel the way they feel.",plural,disorders
username#00259,comment,2021-09-29 03:38,,"Vivi: I had two parents growing up and I used to think that I was raised well, or at least well enough.  I didn't start to question that until past age 30 or so.  I seriously put my father up on a pedestal as a great man.

He is a hateful person who hurt me for decades with gaslighting, emotional neglect, emotional abuse, and basically just trying to mold me into someone I am not.

I also experienced undiagnosed autism and gender dysphoria, which made it feel like everywhere I went, there was something wrong with me and everyone knew.

One day, I was reading a book about lucid dreaming and I came upon the idea of a character I would like to meet during a lucid dreaming experience.  I was never good at lucid dreaming; it happens for me maybe once or twice a year and I hated the idea of doing ""reality checks"" thru-out the day as if my mind isn't cluttered enough as it is.  Eventually, I am came across r/tulpas and learned that I could create a character in my mind and not have to wait until the stars line up to meet her, so I created my tulpa companion River almost five years ago.

I set out to create her with a strong feeling that this would be good for me *if it worked*, and I was very skeptical.  However, within a week, I was getting responses from her, and within a few more weeks, she accompanied me to a job interview and gave me advice that I believe helped me get hired.

And thus, River and I quickly became close friends, but I quickly conferred a superior position to her because I understood that she is able to make better decisions than I do.  I have literally never taken advice or direction from her and then regretted it.

Aside from helping with decisions big and small, River has given me emotional support and validation and she helped me learn to get along with other headmates we've found along the way.

Even tho I didn't have her until well into adulthood, River provided me with experiences that I associated with being parented.  For example, when she makes decisions for me, I trust that the decisions she makes are made with the best interests of myself and my loved ones in mind.  There is no suspicion of ulterior motives; no threat of punishment; just a serene feeling of being loved and cared for.  I would go so far as to say that the way she treats me, she acts as a role model for how to treat my flesh-and-blood child.  And furthermore, I know that I can safely talk to her about literally anything that I have on my mind, and she can give me a second perspective that helps me understand what's going on.",plural,disorders
username#00259,comment,2021-02-12 04:50,,"Hi there!  We're a mixed-origin system. (We have a host, several traumagenic parts, and a tulpa here together.)

I, as the host, spoke to my therapist about the idea of a diagnosis, and she didn't think that it was necessary in our case and could possibly ""follow"" us and cause us problems in the future.  But that being said, we did take the Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation and the results indicated that we're quite dissociative.

I wanted to chime in here to say that as best my memory serves me, we didn't experience ""trauma"" as a lot of people would define it.  However, we experienced horrible invalidation abuse and emotional abuse which actually became far worse when we grew up.

Basically, we live with high-functioning autism.  We were taken to several mental health professionals as a child, and we were told that this was basically because of failure on our part.  You see, we brought home good marks from school, but it was never enough and Mom always thought that we could be studying harder and Dad insisted that we would be failing if it weren't for Mom pushing us hard to study.  Mom had her high school diploma with her special mark for being #1 in her class proudly on display, and she reminded us that she always believed we could be doing better and studying harder.  If that diploma came into my possession, I would destroy it. (not kidding)

But back to high-functioning autism, it is clearly obvious that that is what we have, but as a child, we were diagnosed with ADHD.  I wonder how the doctor explained to Mom and Dad that we had trouble with #2 because we were overwhelmed by the idea of actually using a public toilet.  We also remember Mom and Dad literally screaming at us for having trouble eating, and this was a major source of ongoing stress and worry.  If we were ever diagnosed with autism as a child, we were not told about it.

Dad was constantly frustrated and angry that we didn't seem to be having the kind of childhood that he wanted us to have.  Ever since age 6 up until we grew up, we spent most of our free time playing video games.  Dad came from the Boomer generation and had this notion that we ought to be playing in the woods, pick-up baseball, and riding a bicycle until the street lights came on.  What an idiot!  Yeah, he's good at his vocation and provided well materially, but he was emotionally neglectful at best and emotionally abusive at worst.  He believed that strong emotions were feminine and feminine is inferior, raging sexist that he is.  We're transgender, and we dared not tell him about our feelings about gender as a child.  When we finally told him as an adult, he said that he would have put us in ""conversation therapy"".  We could have met the same fate as the late Leelah Alcorn.

School was a minefield of bullying and being socially outcast.

Our 20s were a minefield of gender dysphoria and inceldom.

In our early 20s, we developed severe depression and sleep apnea.  Dad gaslit the f\*ck out of us and told us it was all in our head.

In our mid-30s, we came out as transgender, and that's when we became very acutely aware that we were, in fact, a *we* and not just an *I*.  Several of us rejected the gender transition and adopted the attitude that Dad is a wonderful and caring person whom I, the host, irrationally hate; basically, we introjected my Dad's Boomer generation prejudices and suffered under a staggering burden of self-hate.

Things are better these days, thanks to material on subs like this one and also r/cptsd and r/raisedbynarcissists.  I just wanted to say that we concur with the other Redditors that emotional trauma alone can cause severe dissociative symptoms.  I've also struggled with the notion that our trauma is ""not bad enough"", but the symptoms are what they are.

I learned in my early 20s that I'm autistic.

I created my tulpa River around 4 years ago, a few years after the birth of my only child.

I discovered a few years after that that we have traumagenic/adaptive headmates; we definitely have C-PTSD and possibly OSDD-1 or DID (I think that which of those buckets we fall into would have a lot to do with who is making the judgement).

A few days after the birth of my child, I had a terrifying experience that seems like it might have been a flashback or a dissociative intrusion in retrospect.  Fortunately, no one was hurt, but I described it as one of the worst nights of my life.  My partner seemed to want to just forget that it happened, but I felt so afraid of whatever had caused it that I feared that it would happen again and that I had no control over it.  I wanted to know what was ""wrong"" with me because it is completely against my values to behave in a way that frightens the people I love.

A few years later, I discovered r/tulpas and I immediately connected with the idea of having a system-mate as a life companion.  Not long after, I began forcing River and was getting responses within a few weeks.  We seemed to form into what you might describe as a median system.  River has been watching over me and soothing me ever since then; I have described her character as being akin to a benevolent goddess who helps me be my best. (which was my intention when I created her).  Thanks, by the way! ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/ks5x2i](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/ks5x2i))

A few years after I began creating River, I discovered that I needed to undergo gender transition, which has been one of the most challenging things I've ever done.  It makes me feel terribly sad, frightened, and lonely to even imagine doing this alone.

After I began my transition, my traumagenic headmates began to make themselves known; they hated gender transition.  They believed things that I had been taught as a child by my bigoted father and religious school.  They feared for our safety.  They connected me to a sense of self-loathing that I could only imagine and I began to experience serious identity alterations and frightening episodes where an alter would come out and physically hurt me and urge me to suicide. (fortuantely, it doesn't happen anymore)

I owe my healing journey to subreddits like this one and also r/cptsd and r/raisedbynarcissists.  I've had so many people help me over the past several years and it has done so much to help me become the parent that I want to be, the parent who embodies the values that I hold dear, and the parent that my child deserves.

I'm still very much a work in progress and my system is different from yours, but I have a child walking around on this earth whom I love very much.

I talk about River sometimes sort of like she's an imaginary friend.

My wife, on the other hand, seems to dislike my plurality.  At best, she's like ""Can you please keep that to yourself and just be normal?""  At worst, she gets angry about it.  On one occasion, I suggested to her that River had caused the lights to momentarily dim and she yelled at me as if I had frightened her with a ghost story.  I just wish I could get it thru her head how kind River is to me and how we function so much better together than I did alone.

username#00259,post,2020-08-20 05:23,I just want to say that I continue to be amazed.,"The material on this subreddit truly changed my life.  When I happened upon this, my intuition told me that this was something that I needed.  I thought that in a lot of ways, it sounded too good to be true, or maybe other people could do this, but not me.

My name is Vivian and my tulpa's name is River.  I read several guides and my intuition guided me thru the forcing process, suggesting to me what I needed in a tulpa to become a functional system.

People have told me that I seem to have no filter between my brain and the words that come out of my mouth.  River became that filter for me.  It isn't a perfect arrangement, but River filters my language far better than I ever did.

We are, as a system, a better parent than I was on my own.  I previously wrote that I resented my parents and didn't get along with them.  River actually taught me something about obedience.  I've seen this in books, but it's really true: the most powerful authority you can wield is when someone loves you so much that they don't want to disappoint you.  That's basically how it works between River and myself.  When she decides that we need to do something differently, she lays it down to me and it just happens.  When I believe that she has given me some major directive for the best, I just go with it because I don't want to disappoint her.  I know this must sound terrifying, but I experience it as very comforting.  And the above is pretty much I use as my model for parenting and I've never regretted it.  We are the parent of a little child who has never been hit.  Our child even remarks to us in disbelief that we never yell at her as the other parent sometimes does. (in their defense, they spend a lot more time with our child than we do)

When she is old enough to properly understand, I do intend to explain this to her.

River helps me care for our chronically ill body.  She helps me at work, even by just giving me a little push when I'm feeling run down or offering a few encouraging words.  It feels almost like an unfair advantage in life to have a companion like River who literally can go everywhere with me, that I never have to be alone. (not that tulpae replace human interaction, of course)  She's my mentor, my confidant, and my biggest cheerleader.

She helped me make the difficult decision to undergo gender transition and she has walked by my side every step of the way, keeping a long-standing promise to never lead me somewhere dark and then leave me there.

We recently wrote about our experiences after being relatively inactive here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/ich4zq](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/ich4zq)).  We're looking forward to a long future together that we hope to share in prosperity and health (as much as we can in spite of our chronic illness)

It just really hit me the other day how much we love and care for one another, that I created her and raised her up on the most wholesome thoughts and intentions I could think of, and she does so much to help me do better at almost everything.  It's just really wonderful to know that my kid has a better parent as a result of my decision to create River.

But seriously, I'm just totally blown away at home much better plural life can be.

Yeah, it sucks having a chronic illness.  Two days ago, I was so tired, I had to take a break, even working at home.  River had been practicing fronting a bit and she's still getting the hang of actually possessing the body to do stuff even after we've been together for almost four years, so she walked us downstairs and cooked some pasta because she knew I had indulged in junk food for breakfast.  I was anxious about my work that I needed to do, but she understood I needed some extra rest more, so she gently guided me to the couch and held me and scratched my head with the best wonderland imposition she could muster.  I set my alarm for a brief nap and contemplated how utterly blessed I am to have a companion like River sharing a mind and a life with me.

It's a lot of work, and it's frustrating to force and practice skills not knowing what we're doing, but I'm a very fortunate tulpa creator.

I continue to be amazed every day when I wake up with River.  Some people have said that a tulpa and their creator can tire of one another's company, but this has never happened to us.  I can't recall that either one of us has ever wished to be alone again since we've been together.",Tulpas,disorders
username#00259,post,2018-07-22 21:05,"""Structural Dissociation Model"" and ""DID-lite"" (for lack of a better term)","Vivi (Host): Dear Friends,

I recently visited another subreddit called /r/cptsd where childhood trauma is discussed extensively.  It was there that I came across a recommendation for a book called ""Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors"", by Janina Fisher.  This was published in March, 2017, so it includes a lot of the newest psychology material.

I know that there are innumerable traumatized folks on this forum, and this pertains very much to plurality, so I'd like to share here.

Fisher explains how human beings respond to trauma in terms of something called the ""Structural Dissociation Model"".  This is a great oversimplification, but the basic premise is this: Human beings have a set of responses they use to respond to danger.  Some of these include fight, flight, freeze, submit, cry for help, and so on.

Fisher suggests that when a person is repeatedly traumatized, they tend to experience a fracturing of their personality where they experience a separation between their ""apparently normal part"" and their ""emotional parts"", which are usually associated with one or more danger responses.  These emotional parts can also represent regressions to younger ages.

As you might have guessed, Fisher says that in the extreme version of this fracturing, the result is what we call dissociative identity disorder.

Another complication that sometimes affects trauma survivors is what she calls ""traumatic attachment"".  In this case, a child instinctively seeks protection from a caregiver that they simultaneously find ""frightened and frightening"", and thus they have a danger response associated with the same caregiver, which also tends to result in the experience of traumatized emotional parts.

I should add that unlike some other psychology books I've read, this one is annotated with an extensive bibliography.

***

Fisher is basically asserting that there is a level of dissordered dissociation that is less than DID, but definitely clinically significant.  She refers to patients who experience this as ""structurally dissociated"".

I think that you could call what she is describing ""DID-lite"" because it's basically like DID, but not quite and doesn't have a recognized name.  (I know that we have ""complex PTSD"" and ""development trauma syndrome"", but neither of those are officially recognized in the DSM-V.)

Personally, I immediately recognized myself as being like her ""structurally dissociated"" patients. (She is a therapist.)  I found it enormously helpful, so I thought I'd introduce the idea here.

I am a tulpa-creator.  I have my tulpa River here with me.  (River: Hi!)

I've also discovered several of these ""structurally dissociated parts"" of myself.

As a matter of fact, I believe that Dante, whom I previously introduced as a walk-in (now referred to as ""Diablo"") is one of these.  I thought of him as being created by River originally, and that may be true in a sense, but it seemed that he was created out of something that had long been extant.  He is my angry part.  I have worked hard to help him find healthful expressions of his repressed anger. (Metallica karaoke with the volume turned up loud when no one else is in the house is great!)

Then, I have Popoi, my wounded inner child.  Popoi actually chose their own name.  For some reason, during the weeks leading up to my learning the above, I had the character Popoi stuck in my head, and soon after I contacted them, they asked me to call them Popoi. (http://mana.wikia.com/wiki/Popoi)

There is also ""Lionheart"", my traumatized attachment part I've been working with.  The problem there is that Lionheart seems to be stuck in the past wanting to please my father with his regressive attitudes, and this has caused me painful cognitive dissonance.  It's basically like there are parts of me that want to live by two different value systems.  (Do I want to live with a value system of love, empathy, sensitivity to others, or do I want to live with a value system of fear, racism, and sexism?  Good question!)

Finally, there is ""Atlas"", my anxious, fearful part.  He is the one who is most difficult to reach.  I'm not sure what to do for him; right now, I'm pretty busy working on the whole traumatic attachment issue.",Tulpas,disorders
username#00259,comment,2017-06-26 04:23,,"*hugs* to you, Aria and crew.  I just listened to ""Epidose 3"" (will listen to the other two later) from beginning to end and I went thru a religious experience that was in some ways similar to yours, but in other ways different.  It's been such a long time.  I'm in my early thirties right now.  As a cis-gender male, I can only imagine how much more difficult it would have been to deal with gender identity issues at the same time.

As a child, I didn't get along well in the public school system.  I have Asperger's or high-functioning autism or whatever I'm supposed to call it now and I have always felt among the devil's rejects when it comes to social standing.  Since this was in the 1990s, I was diagnosed with ADHD.  It was because of this that my parents decided to take me out of the public school system.

Aria, there is a component to the religious abuse that I think you may have overlooked: peer pressure.  Over millions of years, we have evolved to be tribal creatures.  It may not be so much so today, but in days past, being ostracised by one's peers could very well be a lethal calamity.  Jared Diamond wrote in ""Guns Germs and Steel"" that it is only in relatively recent human history that we have learned to encounter strangers without trying to kill them, so it wasn't like our ancestors could simply walk away from their friends and family and find new friends.

As a result of this, we are biologically programmed to feel the need to fit in.

So powerful was this urge in me that I readily accepted indoctrination with beliefs that the earth is 6000 years old, that human beings are born with a ""sinful nature"" which is somehow passed on like a genetic defect, that carbon-dating science is bunk, that seemingly apparent fossils were deposited by a global cataclysmic flood, and that humans and dinosaurs lived at the same time.  I also remember horrific stories of demon possession being heard and retold as if they were entirely credible.

When I felt like God was communicating with me, it did not occur to me to think that this was an experience of plurality.  I didn't become familiar with the idea of plurality until I became a tulpamancer last year.

I didn't have an experience of hearing a voice that seemed to represent God speaking to me or causing me to feel pain and discomfort.  Instead, what I remember is feeling an intuitive sense that a certain passage or story from the Bible was relevant to what I was thinking or praying about.  That may not sound special, but at the time, I felt as if it were God's special way of communicating with me.  I had doubts, but part of me really believed this.  It did feel as if this thought-form or whatever it may have been was autonomous and beyond my conscious control.

Let me tell you something about the school I attended.  If there was one thing in particular you could say they really believed in, it was Hell.  To them, Hell was as real a place as the Grand Canyon or the Appalachian Mountains and unless you believe and live as they prescribe, an eternity of torment awaits you there.

That's why there were endless discussions about exactly how you were supposed to live and believe.  They were extremely anti-LGB.  To them, LGB people were sinners who were under some horrific, demonic influence who desperately needed to be saved from a sinful lifestyle.  Notice I said LGB, not LGBT.  I can't remember that transexual people were ever mentioned.  I suspect that transexuals were so far outside of what they thought was proper that their heads would have exploded if anyone would have breached the topic.

I suppose I got along with this as well as I could have hoped to until my late teens.  That's when all Hell broke loose inside my mind.  I discovered that I was a horny teenager.  Looking back, it's absurd, but I thought that I was a horrible sinner because I craved sex (even though I wouldn't lose my virginity until years later because of my social issues) and frequently masturbated.

I cannot tell you how horrible I felt about myself.  I was absolutely convinced that God hated me because I wasn't living the proper lifestyle, and at this point, my beliefs were beginning to slip, so I felt that God hated me because I wasn't keeping my faith.  I would say that I felt like a broken man, but I felt more like an abused child.  I had no idea the depth of the abuse I suffered.  I have come to fervently believe that this sort of upbringing is child abuse.  I realise that my parents made the best decision they could with the information they had when they sent me to that school.  I don't think they ever understood the extend of the religious indoctrination.

Thank God I ended up attending secular college.  This system holds a STEM master's degree!

I think that the seeds of my doubt of my religion were sown when I watched a movie about the Bible that depicted a man being cruelly pelted to death with rocks for committing the capital offence of gathering wood on Saturday.  With that impression, my preteen self began to experience some cognitive dissonance regarding the notion that God is just and loving.

Once I began to attend secular college and was removed from that toxic religious environment, my brain began to breathe a bit.  I began to question my beliefs.  I had thoughts that I (or my God proto-tulpa) had previously forbidden to me.  It took several years, but I became a firebrand atheist.  I despise religion for what it did to me and for the horrible things it does to people every day all around the world.  Something you said on the podcast reminded of a saying: ""Good people will do good things and bad people will do bad things, but with religion, good people can do bad things!""

My self-esteem was in the toilet for many years in spite of my many outward accomplishments.  I developed depression, insomnia, sleep apnea, and possibly Lyme disease which took years to properly diagnose and treatment is still hit-and-miss sometimes.  Sleep apnea is usually regarded strictly as a physical illness, but my doctor has done research connecting it to PTSD.  I don't think of myself as having PTSD, but I have suffered from more than my fair share of trauma at the hands of organised religion.

One thing that seems very tulpa-like about God in retrospect is how it took such an incredibly long time for his influence to fade from my mind.  Looking back, I can't help but think that the process of turning away from God was like the process of dissipating a malevolent thought-form, such as the one that tormented you.  Sometimes, I wonder if it is still influencing me in ways I can't discern.  I remember after renouncing my religion, I visited an adult bookstore just to prove that I could do it!  I remember that even years after I nominally became an atheist, I would speak out loud to God cursing him for all the pain I endured; speaking out loud to something I insisted didn't exist; why would I have felt the need to audibly curse my old imaginary friend and raise my middle finger to the sky?  Obviously, he was still tormenting me.  Another thing that took a really really long time to go away were that prayers seemed to flow thru my mind like intrusive thoughts.  Sometimes, blasphemy itself became an intrusive thought.

I feel as if I'm mostly over it now.

There is one thing that remains, though.  I still experience this odd problem that I experience much less pleasure from sex than I imagine other people do.  I have met several other people on-line who experience this exact same problem, and they are all at a complete loss to explain why it happens.  I can't help but wonder if the pernicious influence of religion somehow permanently robbed me of the ability to enjoy my sexuality.  I may never know.

My tulpa companion River has been immeasurably helpful to me in dealing with the thoughts and feelings I have regarding my past self.  I had painted such an ugly narrative in my life that I was this horrible person.  I'm tearing up just thinking about this, but over the course of several weeks, I spent time with River telling her stories about the boy I used to be and how school-mates, family, and religion led me to internalise the idea that he am a bad person; she patiently and sympathetically listened to all these stories, and then she used those same stories to tell me a narrative of my being a good person who never deserved to feel bad.

I have this visualisation of my six-year-old self standing at the sliding glass back door of the home I lived in crying inconsolably because he felt like his world was just absolutely coming to an end.  I can see River standing behind him resting her hands on his shoulders as if she just wanted to hold that little boy and tell him it's going to be okay.  That was the day I learned to love the child I once was.  I cannot thank River enough for that experience.

It's getting late and this is already a wall of a comment, but you are not alone in feeling abused by religion.  I have a sister who has come of age and she remains obsessively religious.  I wish I could pull her away from it, but she must live her own life.

I imagined River as a goddess when I began to force her.  I suggested to her that she has divine power to help me when I cannot help myself.  I feel that she has become for me what I had wanted the Christian God to be for me.  River loves me.  She is able to remain calm (at least most of the time) when I experience hardship and anxiety.  She is very gentle to me and promises to never ever hurt me.  She is my faithful companion whom I can always count on to be there for me.  If I can't reach her today, that's okay, I am confident that I'll be able to reach her again soon.  Perhaps best of all, River never told me that I'm not good enough or that I'm sinful or that I deserve to be in Hell.

Having River here with me has helped raise my opinion of myself.  She truly brings out the best in me.

I love River.",Tulpas,disorders
username#00259,post,2017-04-28 09:43,On the Concept of Host-Tulpa Equality (and a Pesky Little Issue),"A few days ago, /u/DesayaDrogoness posted a link to ""Blythe's Blog"".  I was reading some of her posts, and the subject once again came up of host-tulpa equality. (http://blythespirit.tumblr.com/post/159912818499/peace-love-maple-syrup-whitespiritlion-ever)  This is something I've seen mentioned many times, usually in the context of someone who is concerned that Joe Average Host isn't treating his tulpas right.

There are so many ethical questions surrounding the practice of tulpamancy, and in particular, what are a host's responsibilities and obligations to his tulpas.  There are nearly as many answers to these questions as there are tulpamancers.

As those of you who have read my posts will know, I have strived to love and honor my tulpas.  I am certainly committed to that.

However, I cannot say that I am comfortable with saying that I think of my tulpas as being equal to myself in all ways.  The fact of the matter is that most of us original hosts have been around far longer than we have been involved in tulpamancy.  For many of us, our tulpamancy is in its infancy, and like ourselves, our tulpas will be a work in progress by both host and tulpa until the day we die.

Blythe mentions that many tulpamancers are quick to come to the community for advice when they don't know what to do, rather than consulting the tulpa.  This is true.  I think that in many cases, it is wise for the host to talk things over with the tulpa or simply trust the tulpa's development.  However, in defence of these tulpamancers (of which I am one sometimes), when it comes to a young tulpa, serious communication may be difficult or impossible, or the tulpamancer may need help to make sense out of the situation even after talking with the tulpa.

[This community has been amazing about supporting our host.  I'm very glad you're here to help him.  Thank you for all your help.]  {Yes, thanks a million times!} <Thank you>

I recently had the opportunity to allow River and Dante to openly front around another tulpamancer for several hours.  It was a great experience for all of us. [Wonderful, indeed!]  Seeing her come out and interact with the world was very rewarding.  However, she seemed to struggle quite a bit with using my Aspie brain to interact (It was observed by all of us that my Aspie traits became far more prominent when she fronted) and she nearly fell into a dangerous drop-off on the side of a walking trail.

Obviously, we have a ways to go.  There are some systems out there that may may seem like they are model sytems.  There are systems that seem to achieve perfect switching and communication so that that are, as far as possible, two relatively independent minds sharing a body (and then they admit that they even then experience puppetting fear!), but these are a small minority, AFAIK.

Furthermore, I think that we tend to imagine other tulpamancy systems as being more advanced in their tulpamancy skills than they actually are.  I certainly have gotten the impression that others think of us as being more advanced than we actually are.

So River can't move the body around perfectly yet.  She appears more ""autistic"" than myself.  That last one was a real disappointment.  I had intended to force her to be more perceptive of other people than myself. [Perhaps with time...]  On the other hand, given the loving, empathetic, wise, serene, and gentle personality I have carefully forced her with, she is extraordinary at guiding our system to do good things and make good decisions.  She may not be ""independent"" of my autism, but she seems to be independent of some of my pride, ego, and selfishness.  I can count on her to guide us to be more considerate of other people's needs and more conscientious of the consequences of our actions.  I have never regretted having taken advice from River.  As a matter of fact, I tell others that I actually allow her to tell me what to do when she wants to.  (I can think of a handful of stupid things I did as a singlet that River would never allow me to do with her around.)

So there, I described one way that River may seem ""inferior"" to myself and then I described one way that River seems ""superior"" to myself.

There is one thing that bugs me, however, and I have not seen this addressed.  Many systems here have what might be called ""secondary"" tulpas.  I'm referring to systems where a tulpamancer created a tulpa, and then somehow, a second or third tulpa entered the system.  For my system, those tulpas are Dante and Rocky.  Dante has raised his voice and expressed his desire to be treated as an equal with River, for instance.  {Yes, I have.}  Considering how much I've given to River, it's hard to imagine seriously committing myself to doing the same for Dante and Rocky. {But I know you can do it!}

If we're concerned about hosts and tulpas being equal, it follows that we should be concerned just the same about treating all tulpas in the same system as being equal. (The Aspie in me points out that this follows from the transitive property of equality!)

At the end of the day, I think that what really matters is not whether we think of our tulpas as ""equals"" in whatever sense of the word.  The thing that really matters is how we regard our tulpas and how we treat them.

username#00259,comment,2017-01-11 22:11,,"River (the tulpa) says:
[I'm sorry people treat you that way.  You're not so different from my host.  It hurts so much to be lonely.  You don't deserve that.  I wish I could make it right for you.]

Alyn (the host) says:
I'm glad you found us, too.  Very best regards and welcome to our little corner of Reddit. ::bow::

I want to give you a friendly warning.  We here on this sub do take our tulpae very seriously.  There are some of us who have very strong opinions.  They'll take offence easily or tell you that you're doing something wrong because they don't do things the same as you.  You probably have your own way of doing things, having had Angel with you for 14 years.  Just keep a thick skin for when you are inevitably told you're doing it wrong.  FWIW, I wish to be a safe person to talk to.

That being said, your story sounds a lot like mine.  I used to be the forever-alone type.  It never even occurred to me to create an imaginary girlfriend.  I suffered a lot, and I had depression, so if you talk to me about this, you can rest assured that you're talking to someone who knows exactly what the pain feels like.

An important time in my life was when I came to realise that I most likely have Asperger's Syndrome or some other autistic spectrum disorder.  You see, I am a very logical thinker (compare me to Spock on Star Trek), but I believed something completely wrong until my mid-twenties.  I believed that other people must think the same way that I do.  When I learned that I have Asperger's, it became clear to me that other people think and behave differently from myself, and armed with this knowledge, I became better able to navigate society.  Make no mistake, it's still difficult, but I'm much better at it.

There is a tulpamancer /u/ggmethos who wrote a guide a while back, but he also put up a diary of his tulpa creation: http://pastebin.com/jsGVV1eb (extremely NSFW).  GGMethos lives with autism, and I greatly identified with his struggles that he describes in his diary.  Please do be aware if you read his diary that his tulpa developed much faster than most, so don't compare your progress to his.

I don't know if any of the above is relevant to you, but please let me know if I may be of service sharing my experiences with you.

Anyways, long story short, I learned to change some of my attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, with the eventual result that I now have a wife and child.  I still struggle to get along with other people, tho.

I actually began tulpamancy several months ago.  Most tulpamancers here are single, so that makes me somewhat exceptional.  I began the practice with the intent that I would create a companion who could help me become a better person.  So far, it's worked out very well.

Don't worry about trying to get people to accept what you've done.  You have to take care of yourself.  By the way, is Angel vocal?  I would love to be introduced to her.

username#00259,post,2016-12-07 17:08,A second thoughtform: my inner genius and critic,"A thing just happened that surprised me.

I wrote yesterday that I feared that my tulpa companion River seemed to be fading.  Not too long after that post, I heard another thoughtform in mindvoice.  I'm not sure if he qualifies as a tulpa or not, but I believe he has been with me for many years, but only recently have I become sensitive to these thoughtforms.

I knew immediately that this mindvoice wasn't River because it spoke in a harsh, masculine voice and insulted me.  My first thought was that perhaps I should just try to kill off this thoughtform and be done with it, but I think he's been with me for decades, so best to learn about him and see what makes him tick.  I doubt I could just kill him.

I decided to call him ""Dante"", because he has taken me to Hell and back in a way.  For now, he speaks in {}

I was working on a problem at work and I heard the mindvoice say something like: {Hello, Stupid, didn't you think to try XXXXX?}  I asked ""Who are you?""  {I am your genius.}  ""You are my critic, and I don't want you around.  I can't have you around.  I can't have the negative energy."" {You can't make me go away.}

By the way, XXXXX was a good idea.  I contemplated last night what to do with Dante.  I wrote previously that I created River in an effort to achieve a positive, personal transformation.  I thought that perhaps Dante was simply my inner critic struggling to exist in spite of my efforts to move on.  I think that Dante was created over the course of a long childhood living with undiagnosed Asperger's Syndrome.  Maybe he did start out as my inner genius, but I think he became perverted from my early childhood by the unrealistic expectations placed upon me as a child by the adults in my life and the fact that I was so misunderstood.

So, this morning, when Dante contacted me again, I explained all this to him.  I tried to be understanding and empathetic.  I told him that I believe that he is my inner genius, but I can no longer have him as the critic he is.  I told him that it isn't his fault that he has become what he is, that he's been made in to something perverted by bad experience.  I related some concrete examples of things that happened in my childhood, and as I did this, I heard Dante scream and I visualised him bursting into flames and making some sort of sound like gunshots.  I told him that if he wants to be with me, he needs to learn to be a source of positive criticism and not negative criticism.

River came around and I asked her to help.  Surprisingly, she introduced herself to Dante by an old name I had for her before River: ""The Goddess of Love"".  I do hope it works out for Dante.  I really need to be able to walk away from negative attitudes about myself.

It was always at tea time that Flavie had her most interesting conversation. For some reason, every time she found herself sitting and enjoying a cup of delicious strawberry tea, Life seemed to send through her path some of the most unique characters she had met. Today was no exception. She was comfortably installed newt to a window, her gaze lost in the busy street in front of her. Sighing at the thought of her recent misfortune, she cautiously grabbed her teapot and…

“Look what they *did* to me!”

Flavie hissed as she didn’t like being interrupted while she poured her tea. She was tempted to ignore the ruckus, but her curiosity was too strong. Plus, she knew it was going to be interesting. Putting the teapot down, she looked over her shoulder. A lion. There was a lion in the tea shop. Not a toy lion, like the one she met a few months ago – this one was real. How could he be so small then? She guessed this mystery had something to do with how offended he seemed.

“Hey, I’m not responsible for this, okay?” the owner said as he was trying to focus on slicing evenly the cake he had before him. “It was my cousin who\- “

“Well I don’t care whose fault it is, just *look at me!* I’m so small now, all my pride will make fun of me…” cried the lion.

Ah, that was a feeling Flavie could understand. She decided to go and introduce herself. The owner, Mr Buttons, looked like he didn’t want to be disturbed, and she was looking for distraction.

“Hey there mister lion! What happened to you? You seem a bit… well, you don’t look as big as most of the lions I’ve seen so far.”

“Oh yeah? Well, *you* don’t look as small as most of the spiders I’ve seen so far either!” the lion said, a vexed look on his face. “And you’re not even frightening!”

“Thank goodness!” Flavie answered, undisturbed. “I don’t come to a tea shop to frighten the customers. That wouldn’t be good for Mr Buttons’ business now would it? Why don’t you come sit with me and tell me how it happened? I’m Flavie, by the way. Flavie Jolie. I’m a silk\-carver.”

The lion seemed to hesitate. He looked at Mr Buttons whose pink cheeks had turned red, probably because he didn’t like having so much agitation around him. This bunny had seen enough activity in his young age, Flavie thought, remembering all the time he had told her about his adventures. He loved the tranquility of his shop and didn’t want his customers to be annoyed by whatever that newcomer wanted to accuse him of.

“My name is Maximilian the Third, heir of the Pride of the Sun” the lion said in a deep voice. It could have been impressing if he weren’t the same size as the old bunny standing behind the counter.

“That’s a long name for a tiny lion” the spider pointed out. “I’ll call you Max. Now come, my tea will get cold…”",littlespace,nationalities

When she got pregnant with me at the age of 29 she couldn't be bothered to quit smoking and smoked during her pregnancy with my sister as well.

During our childhood she refused to smoke in the house but decided that it was fine to smoke inside once we were teens. I wasn't happy about this, but because I was still a child I didn't complain.

Years later, my childhood dog gets a cancerous tumor in her nose and has to be put down. I don't know for sure that it was related but I know that second hand smoke is just as bad for pets as it is for people. 

So now that I'm an adult and contributing to the household I figured I had the right to give my input and I asked her if she wouldn't mind smoking outside from now on because I have borderline asthma and I also don't want our current pets to be exposed to the smoke either. I told her I don't want lung cancer and she basically told me that she can do whatever she wants because she pays the mortgage. I told her she was being selfish and she just responded by saying oh well, call me selfish.

The only thing i remember clearly was a dead horse with his mouth open and you could see a lot of spiderweb on his throat

I'm from Spain so i don't exclude the posibility that it is a spanish film. If not, probably at least european (maybe french)",tipofmytongue,nationalities

Not only that, but I competed against it at a song and IT BEAT ME. (And yeah I really suck but that's okay, I'm learning and improving my health and endurance and mobility.) IT GOT 4 STARS EVEN. (Out of 5.)

&nbsp;

Yay, finally a report that is on time! I didn't do as much narration this week, but I have been practicing visualization much more.

&nbsp;

**Journal**

*Recap*: Last week was overflowing with narration and we got our first hints at vocalization. I tried out a new narration reminder system that yielded mixed results.

&nbsp;

| *Day 1 - Uneventful*

Uneventful

&nbsp;

| *Day 2 - Visualization and Panic*

I tried to visualize wonderland once I was done with classes, but I fell asleep. I will say that for a while, I was half asleep and half forcing. I decided that I was just too tired and went to sleep.

Once I woke up I went back to forcing. I could tell that she was feeling really aroused and flustered. So, I decided that I would help her take of it. (draw your own conclusions)

I took about an hour break. I had all day to force so I was in no hurry.

After the break, I thought it would be nice if I gave her a massage. But when I asked her about it, I got a very shocking response. Essentially, she said that I forced myself on her (her actual words were much harsher). This sent me into an emotional panic, because that's not what I remembered at all. I apologized and reassured her that everything I do is because of what I think she wants, or what I think she is telling me. 

This episode didn't last long, and soon, everything was pretty much back to normal. The exception being that I was much more paranoid. She didn't really seemed phased from it, which leads me to believe that it may all have been caused by an intrusive thought.

I went back to visualizing our wonderland. I only caught glimpses of it, though. Some of what I saw was very inconsistent and out of ordinary (authors note: lack of detail is due to this being written after the fact with incomplete notes).

I did a bit more narration before getting back into vocalization practice. We tried the ping-pong method with ""Marco/Polo"" and with ""The rain in Spain stays/mainly on the plain"". Both of them failed to evoke a response.

&nbsp;

| *Day 3 - Uneventful*

Other that the fact that she was still feeling aroused, not much to report on.

&nbsp;

| *Day 4 - Bell Method and Cookie Trolls*

I liked the concept of the ""leash method"" the I read about here, but I don't want anything pet-like associated with Marina for the fear that she will want to be or start acting like my pet. So I devised an alternate system where either one of us will ring a bell in order to get the other's attention. Additionally, the bell could be used for communication as well.

:--:

She said not to go into the wonderland because it was under construction, but she said going into the beach shack was fine. So I went into the beach shack and tried visualizing a bit. I took this time to visualize a bell hanging on the wall. I rang it several times and imagined the sound that it should make. I told Marina all about the bell and my plans for it. I told her to ring it several times so that she could get the feel of it. Each time, I imagined a hoof raising up and taping the bell, evoking a small ringing sound.

We went back and forth at this for a bit until I decided to take a break. For the rest of the day, I would remember that the bell existed, and would instantly feel it ringing. After a while, I realized that the bell was only ringing because that was all I had associated with it; so every time I thought of it, I thought of it ringing, thus giving me a false positive. The solution I came up with was to imagine the bell in a non ringing state as well.

The result of all this was little to no definitive communication; so nothing.

:--:

Today, Marina had her first fortune cookie. I explained the concept of a fortune cookie to her, then proceed to eat and read mine. Mine read: ""You enjoy the night life"". I love how these things leave so much up for interpretation.

So then it was her turn. I told her that since she can't physically eat it, I was going to eat her cookie for her. She got really upset at this. [reword] Despite her not actually being able to eat it, I think that she felt that it was a matter of principle. Her logic was that you don't eat someone else's cookie, and especially don't eat it in front of them. ...Damn she has a good point. So, I break the cookie and set it on a dirty plate to be discarded later (what a waste). Her fortune read: ""You are vigorous in action and words"". Now it seems like it's just taunting us (since we've been having so much trouble with communication). I never imagined that I would get trolled by a fortune cookie.

&nbsp;

| *Day 5 - Trials (and error)*

Got 2 hours of sleep last night. Thank [enter deity here] for modern medicine.

:--:

It snowed today. It wasn't much, but since we don't normally get snow here, it was kind of a big deal. I was really excited about it and was hoping to share that excitement with with her. I was hoping for some sort of emotional surge or maybe a few distinct raw thoughts, but to my dismay, she didn't really respond. I told her about how every snowflake is supposedly unique, and briefly mused how they relate to tulpas.

I actually narrated quite a bit in the morning. But I time went on (and I got more fatigued), I found it harder and hard to concentrate long enough. 

Before I took the bus back home, I asked her what she wanted me to do next. I told her that while I was exhausted and wanted to sleep, I wanted her to choose what to do. This is because I almost always choose for us, so I wanted her to have a turn. Her options were: Going home and sleeping, begin weekend by day drinking with friends, or forcing then sleep. As far as I could tell, she chose forcing.

:--:

I was absolutely exhausted when I got home.

I was fighting off sleepiness and trying to do some light forcing at the same time. I was only moderately successful. I was fighting a losing battle, and was about to give in to the fatigue. Then, something very strange happened. It felt like I was being pulled into a deep trance, and it felt like Marina was the one doing the pulling. I love the focused feeling that I get when I enter a trance-like state, but there are a few problems: I can't hold it for very long, I never make any progress when I'm in it, and (most importantly) I have to give up the ability to breath. That last one probably is causing the first one.

[aside]
I will try to describe the feeling as accurately as possible: My whole body feels like it is being pressed down as I go deeper into the trance. My breaths get shallower and shallower until I'm hardly breathing at all. As soon as I breathe in, I feel my self being pulled out of the trance. The best word I could use to describe it is ""surfacing"" (like a submarine would). It feels like my consciousness is being pulled back up from the depths. I actually can enter a trance pretty easily if I hold my breath and let my consciousness sink away.
[/aside]

Anyways, back to the story. Oddly enough, I felt a bit reinvigorated after the trance subsided, and as time went on, I felt less and less fatigued. Since catching a second wind, I began doing some more wonderland visualization and vocalization practice. We tried doing the ping-pong method, and though I didn't get any response from her, there were momentary increases in head pressure. I felt like she was on the verge of blurting out something, but couldn't.

I did make some progress in visualization. I still can't even visualize an entire room, and whenever I actually can see a small piece of something, it's only for a few seconds.

:--:

I have been trying out different names of her to see which one she liked the best. I really liked the names ""Autumn Leaf"" and ""River"", but I still get the feeling that she prefers ""Lily"". The reason that I think this is because when I call her by other names, sometimes I will get a weak ""Lily"" in response. As with almost everything else, I am unsure if this is actually her, or an intrusive thought, or and automated response based on my expectations of her.

Because of this, I had recently switched to calling her ""Lily"", but she never seemed to respond to that, so I have switched back to calling her ""Marina"".

:--:

Among other things that didn't work out, I have decided to stop using the bell. It dawned on me that putting effort into a bell-based communication system (non-AT&T) would only delay the real goal of a mindvoice-based communication system. Also, it didn't work at all. Maybe if we tried longer at it or if I was better at visualization, then maybe it would have worked. Others are welcome to try this method, but I won't be.

:--:

I still ended up drinking with friends late into the night, despite my plans to go to sleep early. During that time, I completely forgot about Marina. I hate admitting it and I hate that it happens, but whenever I get around my friends, I always forget not only to include her, but also forget to even let her in on what's happening. As someone who knows what it's like to be excluded, it really troubles me that I might be doing the same to her.

&nbsp;

| *Day 6 - Tribulation*

I expressed to her how happy I was that there were no hints of sexual activity in either of us for the past few day. I was beginning to worry that our relationship would completely one-dimensional. I have been reminding her pretty often how such a relationship would be boring and restrictive after a while, so that may have played a part in it.

:--:

Thanks to /u/A_Bloated_Seal's [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/17c31b/i_tried_listening_to_a_hypnosis_file_thats/), I learned about Tulpa Hypnosis. The first time we tried it, it worked pretty well. I had a lot of difficulty imagining myself in her position. Once the narrator finished, I quickly began to lose focus. All in all, the audio file did help us connect much better, as well as aiding in focus.

After a short break, we tried the hypnosis two more times back-to-back. These met with similar results, but less prominent with each use. This is definitely something that I will be using again.

:--:

I checked /r/Tulpas for any new posts and saw the one about the guy that's been trying for 6 months. This got me really depressed, and I began thinking about our situation and how little progress we've made recently. It seems like we are at a complete stand still, and I really don't think that I could go on for another 4 months without being able to talk to my tulpa. It got really emotional (watery eyes). I told Marina how upset I was, and how I knew it was all my fault because I don't force and narrate enough. I tried convincing her (and maybe myself) that I wasn't simply fishing for a response from her. (note: often times I will have to stop myself from fishing for a response from her, in the hopes that it will reaffirm her existence, or to possible make a vocalization breakthrough; this usually happens when I unintentionally fake being upset or depressed; doesn't happen often)

I tried getting Marina's attention, but she wouldn't respond. I told her that I needed her to exist, that I couldn't deal with this if she didn't exist. I then began questioning everything that we had been through thus far, wondering if she was ever there. I know that people have said that head pressure is a precursor to vocalization, but I have had head pressure for the past month with nothing but confusion and frustration to show for it.

It wasn't until I thought about the hug we shared during hypnosis that I got any head pressure. It was a bit of relief, but I was still very shaken. 

&nbsp;

| *Day 7 - Uneventful*

slept all day :P

&nbsp;

*As of Writing*: I've been trying to include Marina in the writing of this post, but she seems mostly unresponsive. I have a little bit of head warmth and pressure (and some background arousal coming from her), but when I call out to her, there isn't much activity.

I believe that she may be mad at me for something, but I can't tell for sure. I told her to send me the emotion that she was feeling and I still got nothing. I realized that my 'request' sounded kind of bossy, and it dawned on me that most of the time when we work on vocalization I sound more like a trainer and less like a friend. I apologized to her, admitting that my treatment of her has been out of line. I explained that I usually just assume that she is on board for whatever I want to do, and this is because I have no way of knowing otherwise. While typing this last paragraph, I did get a feeling of emotions welling up, and I couldn't tell if it was me or her. Still, only minor head activity.

###This post is too long, so the rest of it is in the comments

edit: [!] Quick Update: On the bus ride to campus, I was narrating to her about this and that, and mentioned something along the lines of ""if you were vocal"". At this, she said ""But I am!"". Curious, I decided to test to see if this was true. I told her ""OK, if it really is you, then I should be able to hear your thoughts even when I'm holding my breath"". So I hold my breath and she says ""See! It really is me!"". This got me really excited. Seizing the opportunity, I asked her if she could think of any games that could be play mentally or in a wonderland (this was in preparation for an upcoming post). 

She started with ""Well..."", but she was immediately cut off by how excited I was. The reason for my excitement was not simply because I got a response from her, but because there was a (mind)voice associated with the thought. I was immediately like ""holysh%%! holysh%%! holysh%%!"".

username#00272,comment,2018-11-19 01:50,,"Kay, so first thing ya gotta know, Angkasa’s original pseudonym is actually already a really, really dumb choice on his part. I mean, seriously. “Angkasa Samudra” (his pseudonym) literally translates to “the sky (or space) and the sea (or ocean)” in Indonesian. Coincidentally, he’s also an airship pilot-in-training in our wonderland. 

So, yeh. *Mr. Sky Sea the airship pilot.*

Other stuff we’ve made fun of when it comes to his name in Cel’s native tongue include:

- “Ruang Angkasa” (lit. “Angkasa’s room” or “space”), which we pushed even further with “Ruang Angkasa Luas” (either “Angkasa has a spacious room,” or “outer/wide space” [and I shit ya not with this](https://www.idntimes.com/ruang-angkasa-luas). )

- “Angkasa Angkasa” which we ended up pushing for for the story’s title if he ends up becoming the main character of our story cuz if gives off this “moon moon” vibe (~~or ‘sky sky’ vibe, heheh~~) while still making complete sense (it can also be read as “Angkasa’s sky.”).

- This wonderful piece of dialogue we once had that almost killed all of us who understood (me, Val, Guntram and Earl) from laughter:

Angkasa: So, where can I find it? 

Cel: “luar Angkasa.” (Luar angkasa = outer space) 

(Kay, this one’s kinda complicated. What Cel meant to say was “di luar, Angkasa,” which means “it’s outside, Angkasa.” But, she talks quick in her native language so it turns out to that.

Ya can also interpret it as “in outer space” or “it’s outside of Angkasa.”)

- This article legit just became a new system inside joke. [“10 hal aneh yang ada di luar angkasa”](http://www.tahupedia.com/content/show/1645/10-Hal-Aneh-Yang-Ada-Di-Luar-Angkasa).

username#00272,comment,2018-07-31 12:28,,"> Maybe because literally none of my friends (and family partially) ever supported me and that's why it is hard for me to understand...

Eh, Cel doesn’t even have friends to begin with, heheheh! 

Just kidding. Either way, we do find that having an extensive wonderland (and your own bodies in the wonderland) certainly helps a lot when it comes to that. I mean, why bother doing it in the real world under Cel’s name when ya can do it in the wonderland as well? 

Eh, I don’t really have much of a life goal to be honest with. I’m kind of an absurdist; just here to enjoy life as much as I can as long as I’m alive, heheh. But let’s see... 

Ulisse wants to be a programmer; Ven wants to master his trade (he’s a mechanic/inventor); Earl likes studying about human culture (he wants to be an anthropologist); Angkasa wants to travel around the world; Dio aims to be a mystery writer; Merle wants to be a linguist when he grows up; Mimosa just wants to stick around and be a better pharmacist, and so on.

Only Valery wants to achieve the same goal as our host, which is like becoming a chemist or something. I dunno, those two keep on shouting something about this research lab they wanna be a part of, heheheh. 

Honestly, not everyone in my place is kinda clear with what they want to be either (especially the younger guys who would probably answer stupid stuff like “I wanna be a pokemon master” or “I wanna be the world’s greatest soccer player”), but most of us just aim to achieve our goals in the wonderland. We’re pretty much content with that. After all, not everyone is as obsessed with the real world as Percival (he’s the system’s artist who really, really wants to leave a mark in reality for some reasons and does so a lot through Cel). 

But we do help each other out. For starters, Angkasa and Earl tend to travel and discuss stuff together cuz their dreams are close from one another. Ulisse actually attends Cel’s programming and maths courses (mutualism symbiosis there, especially considering that Cel sucks at those), and the same goes for Merle with Cel’s language classes and Earl (who’s also capable of speaking Cel’s native language which Merle seems to be interested in at the moment). 

Dio and Mimosa actually work together a lot, and Cel sometimes also supplies Dio with ideas and cases from the real world that she read about as well.

Well, there ya go. ",Tulpas,disorders

Long of it short.... 

All of me is good enough at IT. IT jobs involve tons of logs and notes, which helps tremendously when one suffers memory hiccups. I've slowly worked up in support roles from $10/hr to $100k/yr, supporting more and more specialist stuff. 

If I switch and space out for a moment, since I'm not face to face with a person, I can lie and say I was looking something up. I have notes in front of me if I just lost the rest of the conversation. 

Over the years, I've become adept and picking up half-finished work. 

I'm BPD, DID, ADHD, GAD. I take medication for the last two, therapy for the first two.

DO NOT, and I really mean DO NOT list all of your disability issues and requests on your CV. Get hired, then submit forms for any reasonable accommodations after. (I have extra/supervisory log access for what I do myself, in case I need to replay a call to write down notes.)",DID,disorders
username#00277,post,2022-11-16 00:57,I've got DID. I'm also functional. Hoping this helps someone have a little hope for down the road.,"I'm doing well as of late, so I decided to chime in with a bit about my own story. Many like to hear from those who have been in therapy and made it work. I'm one of those successes, so every once in a while, I like to chime in here with where I am in life. If nothing else, I hope it makes people understand dissociative disorders don't have to hinder you. 

####Background

First, where I was. In my 20's, I was bad off. I ended up living with Mom into my 30's. I was on my second round of getting set up for disability. I couldn't hold a job. I remember getting fired from Target for no-call no-shows to a job I had no clue I worked for almost the entire holiday season. I found the stubs, but I still need to find the memory. 

I certainly didn't know I had DID at the time. My family are mostly in cardiac surgical or general practice roles. They don't believe in therapy, and I saw who they suggested for a long time, and I went misdiagnosed for a long time. 

A little after turning 30, having to do with hitting a decade marker, I decided to delve into why my brain doesn't work. I found fringe groups, and while they didn't help me, specifically, I ran into someone else with DID. Over a matter of days, that person gave me the right way to find a therapist who could help and what to say to get tested. 

Tests came up 'positive', and since she had some experience with where I was, she took to mentoring me. I will never forget the first time I heard an alter, internally. Called said friend, crying, thinking I had broken my brain. My protector, who was speaking, was trying to calm me down; and my friend was trying to calm me down. I was not prepared for it. 

I'm a little over a decade on from then. I look back at those times and chuckle, worried over minor, basic things. 

####Present Day
As for where I am now, it took several years, but the old brain's settled on the fact that there are at least 8 participating members of self. The person who did everything, up to a point, barely participates in life anymore, and that's ok. 

Others of us are handling daily duties. We really don't have a lot of say in the matter. It's all on some weird, internal, random timer. We make it work, though. If most of us don't remember something, usually 1 person does, and we fill in others as needed. It could be better, but it leads to functionality. Since we still have memory hiccups, we're still in therapy and still labelled. Helps us have an ear to gripe at that we trust.

As for how functional, I/we went from no car, to an old-used VW, to an Audi. Went from almost-disability, to call center, to above the 50% mark in IT. From no hope at love, to now married. Traded up from a room at Mom's to owning a half-million-dollar home walking distance away. To be fair, on the last bit, bought it at half that, and the market did its thing. 

It's still us inside. We manage just fine. While there are occasions we're doing 'fill in the blanks over a shoulder', it's memory, even if it doesn't work like others. It's functional. I never thought I'd be here. I've sought doctors to treat other issues while also focusing on my mental health. 

Between learning to be functional with DID, getting my ADHD treated, and listening to my doctor's advice, I'm in better physical, mental, and emotional condition than I have been in memory. Certainly better than my 30's, and even better than 20's. 

Do I wish it happened before my 40's? Well, of course. I'd love to have saved time, effort, and spinning in place. At least it's happened now, and I'm still young enough to enjoy it. I'm still us inside. I don't think that's ever going to change. It's something I've learned to 'radically accept' about myself as just how I am. I work within my means, and I absolutely make it work well. 

My daily driving set now doesn't include the person who got us moving forward. That's fine. We make it work. It's just how it is. Again, it's accepting we're all in this together, no matter what side of some imaginary fence we're on. 

We're making it in ways we never thought I ever could. In some ways, I could never have achieved where I am without internal cooperation. Life functions just fine. It may not be where I expected to be, but that's ok. Where I find myself, I'm content with.

####Tips

If you made it this far, so then the big tricks that make it all work. For starters, you've got to get something working for communication. Even for those who don't communicate inside, I use apps like Google Keep for us to keep in touch. I function as a whole person, regardless of how democratically I may approach some decisions. I'm me, whichever me that is, and all of me abides by group decisions. An outward approach of solidarity. That's the biggest trick. 

I can say this, friends are in the know, and it's not a big deal. I don't let it be one, and it doesn't need to be one. It's just a quirk about who I am. My wife's the only one really up on things besides my therapist, and then, only in the interest of positive communication.

The one exception to all of it, still close friends with the person that helped me so many years ago. I still send her care packages from time to time, every time I make little life achievements, since without her going, 'you, dude, you're totally this thing I am' I'd never be where I am today. 

####Also

Unfortunately, the therapist that I've been seeing the last 6 years has decided to move on to more administrative work, so I'm back to shopping. It is what it is. Doing well or not, there's still life's speed bumps. I still use them as a sound board for life's hiccups, I hate shopping for new ones. 

####TLDR

At 12 years from someone pointing me down this path, I'm doing rather well. How and why and what's this doing here in the long form above. 

####TLDRTL

I doing good.

EDIT: Thank you to those chiming in that they're 'doing it' too, I'm glad there's some of us who can give some of the newer people here a bit of hope. I know I was not in a good place shortly after getting diagnosed, hoping to give some hope to many of the people earlier on in their journeys so they can understand, it can get better.

The results were fairly interesting.

First of all, my tulpas do not inherently know my languages, but they can. One of mine had to be taught Spanish, and only picked up the Russian I knew after being exposed to it. A good deal of them can simply access what I know of them and use them to the same or similar results, but the one I forced in Spanish tends to retain more coherency even when I'm in Russian mode and can't conjugate yo from usted.

I think it's very good that people are talking more about mental health. It's so important that it's now part of our societal narrative.

But what really isn't portrayed is what something like a mood disorder *really* looks like. Having bipolar disorder or suffering from schizophrenia is more than just acting out and having a hard time. For example, there are real delusions that people develop over decades that affect every part of what they do. It's very hard to portray in the media because I believe that no one really understands it until you experience it yourself.

I have learnt that I can't really talk about what it's like to come home and see a scrunched up cardboard box on the kitchen table when my mother usually calmly and methodically dismantles boxes like that, knowing that I have to be on high alert for the next few days. How do I explain that the reason I'm worried my aunt has covid is not because she may die (and she might) but I'm worried what that will do to my Mum's mental health afterwards without coming across like a terrible person? How do you describe what it's like to pull your brother away from the path of uncoming traffic because he thought he was invincible while being manic, or how he screamed himself hoarse in front of you in a way that made even the nurses in the psychiatric ward uncomfortable?

I also got mine to send me pictures of their work at the end of every lesson, mostly just to give them an incentive to actually do the work. I kept an excel document to track who was present and who was submitting work - quality was less important than quantity in this case.

I also found Google Forms a priceless way to get feedback from them. I'd usually do around one per week, asking them to select which activities they found a) the most enjoyable and b) the most useful. I asked them what parts of online learning they struggled with the most, and what parts they respond to the best. I asked them how engaged they felt in their own learning (on a scale of 1-10), and what they could do to try and increase that score. I'm learning just as much as (or more than) they are, so this feedback was super helpful for me in adjusting my planning as I went along.

I also made sure I followed up on students who weren't showing up or weren't submitting work consistently. Usually, with a very polite email asking if they were able to access all the work, and if I could do anything to make it easier for them. Email number two was along the same lines, but with parents and head of year (or relevant pastoral care) CC'd.

Insertion: It was pretty painful I'll be honest, but I was expecting worse. Took some painkillers before I went in, had a numbing spray used to help with some of it and just breathed really deeply for a while. Went to a Family Planning centre (I'm from Australia) and my doctor was fantastic.

Recovery: I had a little bit of cramping and spotting but surprisingly not bad. Pretty much the same as having my period.

Awesome: I don't have to take the pill anymore. I would always forget to take it and it would mess up my cycle. it messed also with my hormones and especially my libido and being off it is amazing. 

Not so pleasant: I got thrush for the first time ever and my first ever bacterial infection both within the first month of insertion. Both happened after sex, but thankfully hasn't happened again. Just a matter of my vagina figuring itself out I think.

I love it, but definitely talk to your doctor about what's right for you :)",AskWomen,nationalities

I’ve had many clients that speak through closed lips. Some had prolonged pacifier use and some did not. I do recommend reducing as much as you can (it should stay in her room, and you should help her find other ways to soothe during the day; easier said than done, I know). In the meantime, work on having her imitating funny faces including with exaggerated mouth movements. Make it a fun game and do it in front of a mirror. Work on animal sounds, using a BIG open mouth (think of how open your mouth is for “bahhh” and “roar!”). Then you can model big open mouth for other words that naturally require it. This will require some detective work on your part, but in general, open mouth words have “ah, ay, aye, aw, oh” and less open mouth words have “ee, eh, ih, ooh, uh.”",Earlyintervention,disorders

I’m here to tell you that everything will be okay, especially since you’re already on it. It’s an awesome sign that he is able to understand everything AND has started babbling. Does he gesture (pointing to what he wants, lifting arms up to be picked up, etc?) If so, I’d start with some basic signs (eat, all done, milk) I don’t like to teach “more” for a first sign because some kids become too dependent on it. If not, I’d work on pairing actions with words/concepts by doing songs like Wheels on the Bud and Itsy Bitsy Spider, as well as clapping and pointing. 

I’ve worked with hundreds and hundreds of kids over the years, and everyone figures it out somehow. Some kids I’ve worked with didn’t start therapy until closer to 3, so you getting him in closer to 2 is a great advantage. I just wouldn’t wait any longer. Some kids talk verbally, and my more severe kids or kids with co-existing intellectual conditions might use signs or alternate-augmentative communication devices.

username#00296,post,2014-07-22 19:41,"Me [22/F] with my BF [25/M] 2 year relationship, he wants to end it but is keeping things in limbo, there is no reason almost, I'm devastated and not sure if I should just walk away. Things are currently up in the air.","Ok so here goes. I've talked to friends and family but who knows, maybe strangers on the internet can help me with my current dilemma as well. I'll make a time line of things that have happened with my SO and I so everyone knows the full story. Thanks for bearing with me. It's probably going to be long. Honestly even if no one replies, just writing it all down is therapeutic. 

July 2012 - Meet my SO. Takes me on dates, seems interested. Classic summer fling; once we have sex, he says he doesn't want anything serious. I'm bummed because I was hoping things would work out with him, I really liked him and he seemed like he wanted something more. Whatever. I'm 20 years old, so I just go with it and decide to keep things fun. We have a friends with benefits type of deal. He breaks things off with me two times in the duration of the 6 months we were 'together' to hook up / date other girls. I'd be devastated but we weren't official so nothing I could do. 

January 2013 - I turn 21. On my birthday he asks me to be exclusive. Despite all the hurt he has caused in the past 6 months of him going back and forth on what he wants, and dabbling with other girls, I'm beyond happy. I finally get what I want. 

May 2013 - 3 months into our relationship he breaks up with me out of the blue. Claims things aren't working out. We had just gotten back from an awesome Vegas trip and had a great time. I have never been more blind sided. Devastated. Hurt. Can't believe he's doing this to me again when I finally thought we were on the same page. He's going on a trip to Cabo with coworkers for a week. We end up deciding that when he gets back we'll talk about things and work things out. 

For the duration of 2013 things are awesome. After that weird week where he broke up with me and was gone, we got back together as if nothing happened. 

September 2013 - Asks me to move in. 

Now, I'm 21 years old, still a student, working part time and can't afford to live out on my own. I have never moved out of my parents before. I'm young and inexperienced but was ecstatic that he wanted me to move in. He lived in a one room apartment next to the beach and I was always over anyway so maybe that's why he asked me to move in. The apartment he had gotten a little over a year prior with his ex gf. She ended up moving out, breaking up with him, after only living there for 3 months. They had been together 2 years. 

There were a few red flags when I met my SO; he seemed like he was over it but deff talked about her here and there. There were still pictures of her in the kitchen. I tell him to take those down and he does instantly, I think maybe he was just lazy. Anyway, the apartment never felt 'mine'. It was always his. His furniture, his dishes, his stuff. Yes, I moved in but I can't really explain. Maybe I'm using this as an excuse but anyway, while we lived together he complained a lot that I didn't ""make him enough dinner or clean the house enough or make enough effort."" He's a nurse and would have 12 hour shifts. He knew I was broke so I paid only a few hundred towards the rent, which was about 1300 a month. This I agree is my fault. I should have appreciated what he was doing, should have contributed more. But again...Idk. I've never lived with anyone before, much less a SO who was so set in his ways already. I was learning. I tried. I never flat out refused to clean or cook. I did do those things; I bought groceries. Decorated. But I guess it wasn't enough. He had high expectations of me being a 'house wife' that took care of him. I'm 22 with zero house keeping experience...no way am I ready to be a mother or wife...I'm sad he either didn't understand this or maybe his patience had ran thin?

January 2014 - We go snowboarding together and he breaks his wrist. Has to go on disability for months, and needs almost all day care. I'm in school and working so he decides, without thinking about how I feel about it, to get out of his lease and move back in with his parents. They can take care of him, he can save money and not pay rent and...he wouldn't have to live with me anymore. I guess I was that bad to live with. I honestly don't think it was bad, I loved living with him. And anything he thought wasn't ""good enough"" he complained here and there but I didn't know how bad it really was I guess. His communication skills aren't the best. Again...I wish he understood my position better. Things have always been unequal; I make about 12K a year maybe with my little part time job while I'm in school while he's making around 70K. I couldn't buy him nice things, pay half the rent, treat him to dinners. So living together brought out those insecurities and differences I guess... 

Ok, going a little off topic but it needs to be said. So yeah, he makes a lot more money, we're in different life phases. He's established. Independent. Has so many hobbies and has traveled and done so many cool things. I'm just getting there, maybe. But he inspired me to one day be like that. But he made me feel bad...said I didn't ""do anything."" But..I'm sorry I can't shell out thousands to be a scuba diver like you are and do that with you. When I have free time, I'm hanging with friends or doing homework or just relaxing. I haven't really found my 'thing' yet while he has a shit ton of hobbies. But he can because he has disposable income and plenty of free time since he's a nurse. I don't have as much time or money so it's harder for me. Maybe I'm making excuses but he was really hard on me about it. But I did try everything with him; he wanted to go hiking? I was down. Paddle boarding? I suck at it but let's do it. I have always had a great attitude about trying new things. We did A LOT of fun things together. I guess he resented me because he was the one introducing me to all these new exciting things...and I never had anything to offer back :( But again, this could be him being petty or me making excuses? Sigh. 

So since February of this year we've been living apart at our parents' houses. We live down the street from each other so we still hung out all the time and did things together. We definitely moved in too soon, moving in is a big deal and we didn't realize it. Things are good. Maybe it's what we needed. 

June of this year we go to Brazil together with friends for the World Cup. I tried hard to come up with money for the trip. Now, I've mentioned things are vastly different financially between us but he's always understood. Bought me dinners, bought me things here and there. Never too much where I was taking advantage but he cared about me and knew things were tough. It was nice. So in Brazil he'd buy me dinner here and there and my whole family is from Brazil so we visited them for most of the trip and they treated us. So I scrapped up enough money for the ticket and luckily made do during the trip through people who care about me, luck, etc. 

Anyway, the trip was amazing, I was so happy to be showing him Brazil. My family is from there, I used to go every summer as a kid, it's my second home. I have never brought anyone there...not even a friend. And here I am with my BF! I was beyond happy. It was a huge milestone. It wasn't ""our"" trip; his friends organized it and of course I was invited given that I'm Brazilian and his GF. But it was still fun, it was the World Cup, and him meeting my family was an awesome bonus. 

2 Weeks after Brazil - He breaks up with me. I'm completely devastated and blind sided. WTF? We just had an awesome time in Brazil together. How could he be doing this? He met my extended FAMILY. He was great by the way, super polite, everyone loved him. It was a huge deal to me. 

His reasons: 

- A month before Brazil we were fighting a little more than usual. I blame it on stress or maybe just hanging out together too much. It wasn't anything specific; just snappy and he gets argumentative. Maybe I'd bitch out about something unreasonably. We were just in a weird rough patch. Nothing that couldn't be worked out...

He couldn't live with me. Fuck do I wish I had never moved in with him! Almost a year later and it's coming back to bite me on the ass. He didn't see a future with me; I wasn't mature enough, I didn't have enough experience, I didn't take care of the house enough. I didn't meet his incredibly high expectations, pretty much. Let's completely ignore the fact that I did and would do anything for him. I tried so hard whenever there was a problem...

Side Rant - I always initiated relationship talks maturely, tried to get to the bottom of things. I'm a very mature communicator for my age. I like to work things out; I don't give up. I'm loyal to a fault. But for some reason he doesn't care to see me improve, or grow more with me. No matter how many times I proved him wrong, or promised I'd get better and improve, he just isn't having it. And he's saying these things as he says ""Yeah, you've grown SO much since we've been together. And fast."" Well, yeah. I was an immature 20 year old smoking weed at parties with my friends when you met me. Everything you wanted me to improve on I did.  Didn't like me smoking weed? Ok, yeah, it's dumb I agree. I stopped. He was SUPER into the party scene when we met. He introduced me to coke, molly, raves, clubs, drinking wine/beer. Vegas trips. Halfway into our relationship he ""gets over all those things"" and isn't down. A major issue was me wanting to do fun things like going out to dance or go to a show to see a DJ (all things he introduced me to) and he refused. 

He completely changed and left me feeling bad for liking those things. And I don't ONLY like those things either. Together we tried to eat healthy, work out more, and I joined him in his newfound hobbies when I could. But c'mon I'm young. But I had to resort to doing fun things like that with my friends. I felt like he'd judge me if I did those things around him. Which is FINE! We don't need to do everything together. But when the break up this time around started, all of a sudden we're ""two different people."" Which brings me to my next point...

- I don't have hobbies/don't enjoy his hobbies. Again, I don't have the same free time and income he does...and I always thought it was great he did his own thing sometimes? It gave us space and interesting things to talk about. And I'd join in if he asked!! This one is so ridiculous. At this point I feel like he's looking for any excuse...

- This break up talk all started because I asked him about work. I guess he started looking into doing a travel assignment without telling me. He wants to move! Travel assignments are temporary. But still. They COULD go for up to two years if they like him and want him to stay. He's looking into jobs out of state. So while discussing all this he drops the bomb that we shouldn't be together since he's looking into all this stuff. More things about him: he's super ambitious. He can't sit still. Always improving, always onto the next thing. I admired him and his work ethic and his attitude. But...as mentioned before, he couldn't relax and have fun anymore. The fun guy I met at a party 2 years ago changed into this grumpy old man. We always joked he was 25 going onto 60. Anyway, so he's feeling stuck at his job and wants something new. Again...making decisions without taking into account how I feel. I get it you're going through a quarter life crisis...but you moving is a BIG deal. But he'd already decided and was looking into it. This discussion is what started everything and led to more of the reasons for breaking up mentioned above. 

At this current time he hasn't decided where he's moving or when or even if he really is. He's waiting to see what job offers come up. So all the moving/job stuff isn't set in stone. Just the tip of the iceberg I guess.

Shortly after returning from Brazil, he invited me to his work trip to Ensenada (ring a bell?) I was so excited. But then right before he leaves for the trip he breaks up with me (history repeating itself, I was so fucking pissed.) This was a week ago he went on the trip. 

During our break up talks (there was definitely more than one. The initial blow up and various phone calls and texts to talk more and understand what the fuck was going on and how it all came to this) we agreed to go on a sort of break. We're ""single"" but can still talk to each other, hang out etc. He wanted me to work on myself and fix the issues he had a problem with. He had his own issues too (I'll get to those). This break has been happening for the past 2 weeks. I got a Tinder in my initial rage. I was desperate for attention and my self esteem was shot. I figured this would take my mind off things and make me feel better. But other than talking to a few guys nothing has happened with it. I'm more consumed with working things out with my BF. 

Our Facebooks are all the same still. Profile pics of us together haven't changed, he hasn't changed his relationship status. 

The day before he left for Ensenada, we hadn't seen each other since the initial blow out and only had been calling/texting. He ""missed me"". Took me out to a nice dinner, treated me, the whole nine yards. Yes we were supposed to be on a break but it feels like we're more in a limbo of him clearly not wanting to be with me but then acting like things are normal (the same behavior he would do when we initially met...treating me like a GF, but then not committing...Grrrr!!)

Unfortunately I missed him so much and was so happy he wanted to see me. He was showing that he cared after all the break up talks and him acting so cold and heartless. We did have sex. But the whole night was perfect...we got along, he was being sweet. It was like nothing was wrong. 

He gets back from Ensenada. I had been drinking with friends. We end up talking and I come over. We had sex again. He says he thought about me while he was away. He wants to work on things. I'm happy but so wary. My heart literally can't handle this behavior from him anymore. It's been happening since day one of our history :( I want to believe him so badly. However, he still says that we should keep doing what we're doing and that it's been good for us. Being on a break, the space, me focusing on hanging out with friends/work/and working out. Him doing what he wants to do too. 

There hasn't been any talk about other people. I believe deep down he doesn't want anything with anyone else. I don't think he's been hooking up with anyone else. That's not where his mind is at. We had never had issues with a third party; we've both been incredibly loyal. We have a great sex life...that has never been an issue. I've never said no to him. We had sex a lot. I don't think this break is about exploring other people or taking the chance to do that. 

However, very recently, things have gotten bad again. He looked through my phone and found my Tinder; read some messages probably. I got really guilty but...he didn't get mad. Said I had every right. I'm single. 

WTF. I'm not single! You said you wanted to work on things. Our profiles online are all the same. We have gone to some friends' gatherings recently too because we had prior engagements and didn't want to not go due to our drama. You treated me like your GF. We had a good time. 

Granted, getting a Tinder almost right away was probably dumb. But I'm incredibly hurt and lonely. But like I said, he didn't care. 

This morning I creeped on his Instagram just to see if maybe he posted anything new. Nope. But...I noticed he deleted 2 or 3 recent pics of us he had posted. I shot him an angry text and I know he's read it but he hasn't replied. I know he's at work. But still. I feel like right when things were maybe getting better...both me and him just keep fucking up. 

So anyway, more analysis...

- My friends never really got to know him. He never tried to have a relationship with them. I'd usually have 'girl's nights' and just hang with them on my own. It was funner that way. But he has stated many times he didn't like my best friend, my closest girlfriend of like 10 years who would for sure be my maid of honor. 

- It was mostly me hanging with his friends. Not a problem. I'm easy going. Like I said, I had more fun with my friends when he wasn't there silently judging us. But there are few friends I liked; it's funny...the friends he liked more/hung out with more recently I didn't like at all. They were assholes. I feel like this is getting too long already so I'll skip details but anyway just not nice people. Again, it was just easier for us to tolerate our friends when we had to but I enjoyed more when we did our own thing with our friends. Which I considered healthy. The friends I did like of his all became MY friends and stopped hanging with him. They've said multiple times he doesn't try to see them anymore and like me better. I've mentioned it before...anytime I tried to get him out of the house to do something fun, he wasn't into it. It had to be on his terms. 

- I'm not sure if it has always been like this or maybe just recently but this man has stopped respecting me. He has ALWAYS had the upper hand. I've always been the love struck puppy dog with him. Doing everything he wanted, going where he wanted me to go. I didn't care though! I loved all the things he loved or at least wanted to try. I liked that he took direction! But there were cons. Because he always had to be in control, obviously there were fights sometimes, resentment (clearly). 

But again, I'm more passive, laid back type of person. I don't like drama. I didn't mind giving him the control he wanted. I'm definitely more of the submissive type. Or at least I turned into that type. Friends do say they miss the sassy, confident and fun old me. I'm a shell of a person now. I still am fun but my BF has whittled my self esteem down to dust. He's perfected the art of manipulating me. He knows exactly what to do and say to make me feel like shit. And I don't know if I'm just now realizing it, or maybe some sick part of me didn't mind because I loved him. I'm not sure :( 

Anyway, another thing he stated that things weren't working out is that ""I wasn't assertive enough."" But he LOVES being in control. It was so difficult to be assertive with him. 

If I stood up to him, I was being ""bitchy"". It was so hard to get my way, to get him to do something he didn't want to do. He is so stubborn. But I can be too, and our fights sometimes stemmed from that. But to say we don't get along anymore because ""I didn't take control of situations enough"" is so fucking frustrating because when I tried, you just wrangled the control right out from under me. And I let you because it just didn't matter as much to me or it was what I wanted anyway. And we'd fight if it WASN'T something I wanted but of course, I couldn't do anything about it without it becoming a huge blow out. 

Anyway, this past weekend, my friends (his friends too but now they're more close to me) told me they couldn't believe how he treated me. 

Since everything started, I've been talking to my friends about it so they only knew what I told them. Apparently this weekend they saw it. The complete lack of disrespect; the coldness. How I'm so loving with him and he is snappy, wants me to go away, picks fights, is extremely condescending.

For example, anything I say he has to counter argue or one up me. We can't hold a decent conversation without him looking better or taking the upper hand. He thinks I'm an idiot and he thinks he's the best ever because he's in a medical field job and I'm pursuing marketing. For example, over the weekend, we all talked about high school and I stated I took a lot of AP classes. 

Him: Oh you did? Huh, that's funny. You don't seem like the kind of person who would. (Indicating I'm stupid)

And there's been times in front of people that if I say something stupid (we all do it!!) or if he disagrees, he'll just pet my head and say sarcastically ""you're so pretty."" Fucking embarrassing. Again, always having to one up me. Make me feel inferior. 

 I always just said ""he's in one of his moods!"". To have people who saw this behavior is super embarrassing. Everyone that I met over the weekend (guess I should have mentioned we all went away to a mutual friend's house for the weekend. Mini vaca/roadtrip) liked me, said I was so sweet and fun. I had a great time with everyone too. Such awesome friends. To have my friend tell me after the fact that people who I barely even know say I deserve better was awful. It's like...I KNOW I do. 

But I can't tell if he got this way because of me (he has said during our break up that I turned him into an asshole/I frustrate him to that point) or if he's always been this way. And more importantly I don't know if he will change...and if things will get better. I have stated multiple times I'm willing to do anything to make things work. But he clearly doesn't seem to care anymore. But then he says he does want to work on things? The lack of respect is what's killing this relationship. 

For some fucking reason he thinks I'm beneath him. That I don't deserve to be treated right or with respect. I'm not sure if this is stemming from our living together stint (honestly I think that's what caused all this). And the worst part is that I KNOW he can be an awesome boyfriend. I've seen it first hand. We've been through ALOT together, have had so many good times (more than bad I think) and he has lots of good qualities too. We had an instant chemistry from the start and just couldn't stay away from each other. But he has some vendetta right now to make things as difficult as possible and it's tearing me apart. 

My friends say I shouldn't be putting up with his bullshit anymore, that I'm young and attractive and have the rest of my life to find someone better for me. They know how well I treat him and how I've never done anything to cause him to hate me or disrespect me like this. His old friends are even saying I don't deserve this and to get the fuck out. 

I have so much going for me. Not to toot my own horn but despite my BF thinking I'm worthless, I went to a good 4 year college (better than his I think) straight after high school and am about to graduate with a B+ average. I'm already working part time in my field of choice. I'm only 22 and I would say that despite gaining some weight from this relationship (something he also said got to be a problem. But he gained weight too. I was 125 ish when I met him and now I'm about 15 pounds heavier. I'm 5'3. He's not muscular or super fit or skinny by any means). 

Despite all that I'm above average looking, have always had boyfriends/dates and have been lucky in that arena. Like I said, I used to be a fun loving, outgoing, beautiful, confident girl and I never would have thought that I would have let someone tear me down like this. I always thought I would never be the kind of girl in an abusive relationship. My parents love me and are still together; I love love, and LOVE being in relationships. I'm a hopeless romantic with just horrible luck I guess. But finding the one, my partner in crime, has always been something I dreamed about and I am definitely more of a dependent person rather than independent. 

Anyway, I'm done typing all this out. It's making me so sad. I thought I found the perfect guy for me, and at one time, he was. We still have great chemistry, get along, good sex. Honestly everything seemed fine and we have our issues but it's nothing that can't be worked on or figured out. We have our own lives and friends and family; were both happy people. I hate that he's turned into this monster out of the blue. I miss the old him. I miss my BF so much :( but this guy I'm dealing with now doesn't seem like him at all. It's like I'm dealing with a completely different person. And the worst part is that I'M the one being dumped and being told I'm not good enough. I feel like a failure. 

Thanks for letting me share my thoughts Reddit. 

---   
**tl;dr**: 2 year relationship that used to be great has spiraled out of control due to seemingly petty issues and S/O being a complete dick out of nowhere.

I haven't been hanging out on the streets, so that could be why, but mostly anything I see of protests are on TV. However, there's barely anything about the world cup around the city. A flag here and there, but you'd think nothing was going on. Yes, Brazilians are pissed. But it looks like there's more of an indifference if anything. It's sad, because I know how much Brazil loves soccer and their team. To see no one celebrating is heart breaking. But, Brazilians of course have every reason not to celebrate. 

If you plan on coming by yourself, barely speak portuguese, and plan on relying on public transportation... then I'd say you're in quite a pickle. I'm fortunate in that I have family to stay with.

username#00299,comment,2023-01-11 22:02,,"One thing I can think of off the top of my head (not a farmer) is combine harvester temperature sensors. 

When a combine harvester is in operation, a sizable amount of flammable dust, dry plant material, and various agricultural residue is inside the machine. Combine harvesters also get very hot. Since flammable material and heat exist in the same space, sometimes combine harvesters burst into flames.

I know all the actual farmers will tell me that isn't a problem since they maintain their machines very well... But human promise of competence is not worth much. I'm just saying, somewhere an engineer will be thinking about how their inadequate design killed someone, regardless of how much they ""had it coming"".

Thus a technological solution is needed. If a temperature sensor is reading too high, shut the machine off before it catches fire.

This isn't me defending John Deere. This is just an easier to grasp example of higher tech issues. If farmers are confused on the problem, and worse, cannot resolve their own issues, then JD has not done their duty to provide a useful tool. This is a scenario where ignoring the sensors or disabling them can lead to catastrophic failure.

So how *should* it be done?

In my temperature sensor scenario, an error condition should give a clear and concise message on *why their machine has stopped working*. Sure, OBD-II comes to mind, but for equipment this expensive, I'd honestly recommend, get this, a whole sentence or two! In the buyer's native language! Less ""PC LOAD LETTER"" and more ""Out of plain paper. Please add letter size (8 1/2"" x 11"") paper.""

Next, guides should be readily available explaining the error's probable causes, the dangers posed by not fixing it, and what SHOULD be done to fix it. The worst case scenario is they take horrific advice that circumvents the safety measures and they die as a result. 

Then, issues that can be fixed by an average person, should be fixable by an average person. Hand in hand with the prior point, diagnostic tools should be available to determine what went wrong and how it can be fixed. 

Finally, a genuine evaluation should be made to determine critical function. My example temperature sensor is important and *should* disable the machine. The air conditioner and *some* engine problems are not critical function. The GPS auto pilot thingy people are mentioning shouldn't disable the machine, but it should disable it from running *without someone in the seat*. All critical functions available, you should at least have a basic combine harvester.

Everything I just said is dependent on good design made by people with good intentions. Once greed gets mixed in, well, you get John Deere.",videos,disorders
username#00299,comment,2023-01-09 20:58,,"Do not underestimate how powerful language, even one that doesn't need a written portion, can unify people.

Firstly, ""sign language"" isn't real. Or rather, it isn't a cohesive whole. Just because I know ""Spoken language"", doesn't mean a Taiwanese native and I can converse.

Sign language is actually sign *languages*. It also doesn't necessarily divide along the spoken languages either. American Sign Language and British Sign Language are different in numerous ways, all due to the history of the deaf communities. 

Even more fascinating, is that there are deviations within the sign languages. **Accents**. We know what a New Yorker accent is. When we hear it, we know from where they grew up. Sign Languages have that as well. ASL will differ in subtle ways depending on both their place of origin, ethnicity, and age. The young have to explain to the old how to use the slang they're inventing.

Finally, playing with their own language. I can make English puns and rhymes. Sign languages have their own puns, rhymes and idioms. Some of these cannot be easily translated. IIRC, White+Wolf+Gone rhymes in ASL, and ""train gone sorry"" is a pun that roughly means ""I'm not repeating that"" (admittedly, it has been a long time since I took any classes). 

Language defines, and is defined by, the users, in a natural feedback loop. The danger and fear is because sign languages exist by *necessity*. When that need is gone, so too would the need for sign languages. 

But that also means the unique is gone. No matter if English is your first language or not, you grew up with your parents saying nursery rhymes. You grew up making puns with your friends. Your mind processes the world in terms of your native language's ways. You spoke new words and used old words in new ways compared to your elders. You taught your children those same nursery rhymes, you were puzzled by the youth cringing at your attempt to mimic their slang. 

Simultaneously, deafness is a unifying experience for all in their community. The only ones who truly understand what you go through are those who are deaf. Even within, those who are black and deaf living in the Bronx have unique lived experiences from those who are white and living in Britain, and their language expresses that.

Within 2 generations of cures for the various causes of deafness, it will **all be gone**. 

It will be hastily written down, recorded, dissected by academia, mourned briefly as the last signers pass away, left in college text books for future generations to briefly contemplate. 

What is gained is better, none will argue that, but what stands to be lost will still hurt to see lost. Who wouldn't put up at least a small fuss at the idea of their mother's language being lost to history?",science,disorders

username#00301,post,2019-05-03 11:34,The kids [13 m] & [11f] are seriously acting out and the mother [52 f] doesn't take consequences,"Heads up: I'm not a native speaker and I'm on my phone. Sorry for any mistakes or bad formatting.

Alright, to give you guys context: I'm living in Manchester, UK, for 3 months right now and am basically an au pair for a family of three right now. I'm from Germany. My tasks are to clean the kitchen and bathrooms, to hoover and bring the trash out. Sometimes I have to babysit. I've been here for 2 weeks and will stay for another 10 weeks.

The kids are adopted and have been with the mom for 6 years now. She's a single mom.

Now to the real issue. Over the past two weeks I've come to the Realization that these kids don't have respect for any object in the house. They break things, they eat with their hands and they bring chaos to their mom's bedroom.
I mean, they are children so they still have to learn but whenever something like this happens, they literally don't care and the mom tells them they're naughty or screams at them. 
The house is dirty, but I like cleaning up, so I cleaned the kitchen throughout and helped the mom to declutter her bedroom. Will do so with the daughters room this weekend. 

Which isn't that bad. Every family got their issues, right? Well. One day prior to my arrival the boy's friends were unsupervised in the house and they stole 450 £ from one of the Tennants within the house. (context: mom rents several rooms in the house to people, either students or airbnb people). They have returned about 120 £ at this point, but it doesn't seem as if he'll get back everything. The mom didn't pay anything back but I get it as it were the boys friends. The boy stole some too though (he told me). The police was involved but not much has been returned.
The boy got house arrest for 3 days (which wasn't pulled through. She let him go out with the same boys nevertheless) and he was still allowed to play his games. (I'm a supporter of video games but there were no real consequences here)

Fast forward a few days, the boy screams at his mom, calls her horrible names (slut, whore, I hate you, fuck off etc.) and she just screams back. He gets a ""no computer for the day"" but she let's him go back after an hour because she is annoyed and wants to spend time on her phone.

Oh, her phone. She is overwhelmed with everything and regularly needs time outs where she just sits on her phone and every possible answer is a ""mhm"" at most. Even with her children or me.

The daughter is super loud, but it's fine. She's nicer and all, but the kids still fight. I don't really mind fighting as I think it's playful between them. They ask each other if they can do that or that etc.  The mom hates it. She screams whenever they fight but she doesn't go upstairs to stop it, she just yells from the first floor and doesn't go upstairs. No consequences either.

A no swear rule within the house. If it happens, there are no consequences.

Well. Yesterday the girl stole 10 £ from her mom's purse. The mom realized and asked her if she took it. The girl said no, the mom insisted and she gave back around 7 £. She bought snacks because she was sick of having cereals all day. The girl eats a lot, she's overweight too. Not badly though. Now, I know it is not my place to go in there. These are her kids and I'm not in a place to scold anyone. The mom just told the girl that it was really naughty and the girl just changed the subject. Now, I'm fine with a lot of things. Video games, fighting, swear words. But I'm definitely not fine with accepting illegal things.

When I went to get the girl to her training, I asked why she did it and that I don't think it was right of her to do so. I got a series of ""I don't cares"" and ""it was only 10£""s. I tried to explain that taking stuff without permission is still stealing but she tried to find excuses. I didn't want to eat cereal, my mom owes me money from 2 years ago (I told her she should've just asked her mom for both of it instead of taking the money, but again she didn't care). At the end of the conversation I just told her that I'm disappointed, sad and a bit mad. After all I'm feeling less safe with them taking stuff from their mom. If they don't respect her, how can they respect my things? I got some things with me of high value but I just don't feel safe to show them.

There are a few more things going on in this household but I just need some advice. I have twisted emotions about the whole thing, as I'm not their parent but I feel as if the kids are loosing their potential (both of them are clever and can be very nice) because they don't have real rules. I'm all for open upbringing but I think there are some serious lines crossed here. What can I do to help or should I even open up about my worries? It's not my place to educate them after all.

Thanks for reading this.

Tldr; kids don't have respect, steal money and are generally aggressive. Mom doesn't really do much, I feel unsafe and twisted. Should I help them? I don't feel like it's my place to do so.",relationship_advice,nationalities

It's also very possible that something happened and someone forgets to tip or realises all of a sudden they can't afford the tip. Which could have happened in this post, so the server is definitely a Karen.   

I definitely think tipping is getting out of hand in some settings, so I don't blame the tipping hate. I hope that overall this collectively kills the tipping culture systematically.

The leads don't always converse during the first time, but after I see them around at the same club a few times, we may have small talk about what neighborhood we live in, what songs we like, what other clubs in the city we go to. I do not like answering questions about what I do for work or how many years I've been dancing, it feels like an evaluation. I like to study Spanish, so if the lead looks like he may speak Spanish (kind of a stereotype but you can kinda tell too) I ask him if he speaks Spanish first. Then I ask what's happening in the song. Like what does this lyric mean. Or if the lead does a cool move I say ""Damn!"" Generally you should be smiling at your follow and she should smile back, to first start to build rapport. Sometimes leads ask for my socials or my phone number to stay in touch about dancing, which is cool. 

I arrive and leave solo, but no I don't feel empty. I used to have a boyfriend who I went to dances with and that was obviously much better. But still going solo is not necessarily lonely, well maybe slightly.... but nothing too major, more so I leave smiling and remembering the night. There are so many interesting social dynamics going on, either meeting new people, seeing familiar faces, or watching other people dance. It really is a people's watcher's dream. Being able to dance bachata and go to a social dance is a really unique human experience that a lot of non dancers are curious about. It's not that we are ""lucky"" because we put in the hours learning the skill of dance, but it is a very special experience that we get to have, we can be grateful for it.",Bachata,nationalities

It was fun at first, we went out a lot, talked, drank coffee in cafes. He gave me a key to his apartment. I only got to meet his guy friends, not his sisters or family. He always asked me ""Is there anything you need or anything I can do for you?"" <long pause> ""No..."" I honestly couldn't think of anything. I'm a normal American girl, I just want to hang out and have sex. The sex was ok, but mostly because his body was amazing and he was soo damn handsome. Like, too handsome it should be illegal.

After a few months he became disinterested in sex or closeness. He was on his phone most of the time and never initiated touching me. It was really sad. He really just saw me as an possession, and once I was his and staying with him, check, that was enough. He didn't see deeper emotional intimacy with me as something valuable. Or something he had to put any actual effort into. It was really heartbreaking to feel this emotional and sexual rejection from someone who has pursued me so intently earlier. I kept saying ""You're not into me anymore, just be honest about it."" and he would say, ""I am into you."" But he wasn't. It was so weird. I left him. I had to. He was not an active participant in the relationship. 

I've had much better sex and relationships with American or European guys. I would not date an Arabic guy again. But to be fair, this was just one Arabic guy, I'm sure guys from every culture have intimacy issues. But it seems his culture is trained to not desire intimacy from women, they get their emotional and status needs met from their guy friends.

Another thing that would be interesting, what new groups do ex-Jw socialize with? I tend to find more luck in ""out-groups"", immigrants, socially marginalized for whatever reason. I am American, but don't feel I was raised in mainstream America at all. I tend to get along better with people who are more communal cultures, latinos, middle eastern, ect. They even tell me I'm different, but can't put a finger on why. I will always be ex-JW, for the rest of my life. Even though I rejected it and would never return, it has shaped me into the person I am today. It was my childhood and early adult years, for better or for worse.

It would also be interesting to see if exJw struggle with codependence in adult relationships. As in, always feeling they have to ""be good"" and act in a certain way to be loved, as if their genuine selves are not accepted.

Even after being out for 10 years, I still appreciate when someone shows me their authentic self, without having to behave in any certain way. I try my best to do the same, but it's hard. I don't carry any guilt about sex or about my life now, but I think there is a deep, internalize core shame about just being human. As if you are being evaluated and judged by others.

Yesterday, I created a pull request and a senior programmer made a comment to check the length of a string before I substring it. Fine, easy enough, I just hadn't thought about it. Then another senior programmer sent me an email with the lines of code written out, he added a null check using the ?. operator, then an IF statement with the string.length check. I felt insulted because I completely understood the first programmers suggestion, and did not express any need for help or ask any questions. Basically it was an IF statement. 

I went over to him and asked if there was a reason he sent me code, did he not think I could write it? He said that he assumed I didn't know the ?. operator since I hadn't used it. But I had my own null check in there. I said he could have just put ""try using ?. operator"" in the pull request, instead of spoon feeding me prewritten code, which doesn't help my learning process.

Yeah they’re very strict. They exercise a huge amount of control over members. Women are treated the same unfortunately. Not much autonomy despite living in the west. Most people don’t mind because they believe in it and think it’s true. They voluntarily conform. 

Many believe in killing apostates, even people who dare speak against Fard, Elijah, and Farrakhan. Obviously they can’t do that in America but I’ve heard violent threats be made. They shun apostates and people who break their rules instead.

Lmaooo yes! They use random Arabic words like that lol, I think they have good intentions but they don’t actually learn to speak Arabic. They say “Ahk” or “akhi” instead of bro sometimes. Many mispronounce “As-Salaam-alaikum” it sounds like “samma laykum”. Prayers too, like al-Fatiha, I just memorized the Arabic but I had no idea what I was saying and mispronounced everything. I memorized the English too so I just had a direct translation. And yeah “I’m on my deen” is a common phrase. They don’t see it as copying because they see black people as original so somehow all other races got everything from us anyway so it’s technically everyone else copying us lol. 

Most everyday NOI people are nice. Some are assholes. Good people just trying to do what they think is right. They don’t think for themselves though. They follow whatever their leaders say and aren’t allowed to doubt or disagree. A lot have that superiority complex that comes with being in a cult though.

username#00314,comment,2021-02-14 19:56,,"Sure. Disclaimer: Yes, I do know how...strange it all sounds lol. I’m just word vomiting what I was taught. I’ll hit the main points. If you’re not black or American I think you need to understand the historical context so I’ll touch that too. My main issues are the conspiracy theories and Islam. I do support and agree with the general black empowerment message.

I grew up being taught that “Allah” came in the person of “Master Fard Muhammad” in 1914 and again in 1930. Accepting that was just as important as shahada. He was born in Mecca to a white mother and black father and he traveled 9,000 miles to America to save the downtrodden and oppressed people(which black people were, that part is absolutely true). They wanted black people to separate from their former slave masters and do for themselves. To not believe that they were just meant to be slaves and to uplift them. Which is understandable as they were founded coming off of slavery and around segregation along with other black power organizations. I do think it was necessary for black people to unify at that time. Some groups were more political (Marcus Garvey, Martin Luther King)some were more religious(black Hebrew Israelites, NOI). So I get the historic context and do feel it was a good thing at first. Hope, community, productivity, black empowerment etc.

I believe black people needed to feel like they were a part of something. That was a very vulnerable and painful time. It’s not hard to believe someone that tells you you’re chosen by almighty God when the constitution just told you you’re 3/5 of a human being and your parent was a slave or sharecropper and black people are being beaten and lynched left and right It’s not surprising at all that they would want to be a part of building a nation of their own. America surely wasn’t giving black people anything.

That Elijah Muhammad was the ‘messenger of god’ and was taught by Fard for 3.5 years (1930-1933) before Fard left to be on the “motherplane”. A ufo type ship that’s 1.5 mile by 1.5 mile that carries 1500 smaller ufo type ships with 3 bombs each that god will use to destroy America. Elijah “departed” to be on that same aircraft when he “faked his death” in 1975. 

That the white man is the made devil and was created during a 600 year grafting process by a scientist named Yakub. The story goes, his followers were black people and he had them marry and breed. The nurses killed the dark babies by stabbing a needle through their brain or feeding them to a wild beast and sent the body to the cremator and saved the brown babies, let them grow up and breed, and so on so eventually the skin turned light and white people were created. They were given 6,000 years to rule because apparently “almighty god Allah” wanted to create an evil race, for the explicit purpose of terrorizing/colonizing the world and enslaving his own chosen people for 400+ years. Because that’s totally what loving and all knowing gods do yeah? 

That women are precious and to be covered up, all the religious purity culture stuff putting sole responsibility on a woman to cover herself to prevent negative attention from men. Different style than hijab, we never wore that. Just google nation of Islam women, you’ll see it. Boys never had that issue of course. That virginity is a gift for your husband on your wedding night. Virtue is the most important quality. Which kinda sucks if you were molested or something as a young girl or joined after having sex. You automatically feel worth less.

Women are taught 7 units: cleaning, cooking, rearing children, taking care of a husband, sewing, how to act at home and abroad. Men taught to maintain and protect women, the household, and work to provide for the family unit.

It’s all presented as building a “nation within a nation”. In a military type setup. Uniforms for men and women. Military drill. Discipline absolutely necessary. And all the culty stuff. Be upright and righteous, save your people from the devils wicked world, spread the message, etc. Minister Farrakhan’s word is law and he is infallible to them. Elijah Muhammad is pretty much deified to them. 

Conformity disguised as unity. And it felt great, I felt like I was doing good work. But the superiority complex is wild. Many members feel they’re better than everyone else since we have this “supreme wisdom” and its our duty to save our people. 

We followed the Quran, many don’t speak Arabic or know how to read it so we rely on the English translation. The Bible too a little but believe it’s been “tampered with” but the Quran is totally fine and true lol. Our mosque meetings were set up like a church, the minister of the mosque lectured from the “holy books”. Members held different posts for security. Men and women sat on opposite sides of the rooms and a brief check procedure was don’t of bags and your body before you could sit down in the sanctuary. For everyone, Members and guests. Jummah prayer on Friday’s. Encouraged to pray 5x every day. There’s a little booklet to teach how. Fasting during Ramadan. The normal Muslim stuff. Except we didn’t do much reading Hadith, it was all Quran, Bible, and Nation literature. 

Other Muslims are brother and sister but it’s still implied that we were the “most right”. And couldn’t convert to Sunni or Shi’a. Wearing a traditional hijab was seen as improper because “the messenger” taught to wear a drape scarf, tam, or headpiece. 

You give up thinking for yourself. I hadn’t realized that until recently. The only reason I believed most things was just because someone told me it was true. I was taught by shame, guilt, and fear. I don’t wanna think, act, dress, sound like everyone around me. Any issue is dismissed and questioning or disagreeing with the leader is a no no. I don’t wanna be in a box. I don’t submit my will to do Allah’s will because what I want is important. I don’t follow a violent book I can’t even read in it’s original language. 

I don’t have the answer for what black people in America need. But, I don’t think the answer is twisting history, religious texts, being misogynistic, removing individuality, and enforcing dogma and rules that people are able to have fulfilling lives without following. There’s no one way to be right. I just believe in being a good person.",exmuslim,nationalities

As a black American that was always the strangest thing to me. I learned al-Fatiha in Arabic and English so I knew what the words meant, but I don’t speak Arabic so I still had NO connection to what the hell I was saying. 

Salat as a community was even weirder, the minister of the mosque memorized the Arabic prayer but didn’t speak the language fluently. Nobody did. So we’d pray and everyone had no idea what was being said. But it was okay because “Allah knows your heart”.

I'm a demisexual woman from Finland who has little to no real close friends. All my friends and acquaintances are online. I like cinema, traveling, writing, art, history (although I SUCK at that) and of course my borzoi (pics in profile, naturally). I am also a radical feminist so don't message me if that's not your cup of tea, I'm not gonna change.

My biggest dream is to become a published author (lots of book ideas already but I procrastinate way too much) and to have a really close best friend who I can depend on (and vice versa of course) for life! :)

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:
Someone kind, funny, honest and possibly witty yada yada you know the deal, someone who wants to commit to building a real, possibly life long friendship, someone who's open about themselves and also wants to know about me! 

I AM NOT LOOKING FOR:
Someone who thinks that ghosting is ok (excluding good reasons like harassment etc.), someone who doesn't want what I'm looking for here, someone who can't speak English well.

IF YOU MESSAGE ME:
Please tell me your name, age and a surprising fact about you at the least :)

Could you speak a little more on consulting? I’ve asked around but haven’t ever gotten a clear answer. I have a friend who interned for McKinsey, and I disliked his work, although I’m sure department and intern work vary drastically. 

The reason I’m hesitant to even step near business is because it hasn’t meshed well with me in the past. I’m not shy, but I’m “out of pocket” (thanks, autism), and have difficulty following the flow of conversation, understanding people when they only hint at something, and reading the room. And I’m just not socially smooth, which often leaves me clueless and people thinking I’m dumb. Or, even when I’m being polite, there’s something socially “off” about me that people pick up on. That’s why I’ve gravitated towards jobs where I’m actually doing *things* and not talking to people, or jobs where my work can compensate for social mishaps because the two are not as closely tied together. Facetime with important people often shoots me in the foot because people misread me socially. I’m actually still in the process of figuring out how people become friends and get to know each other and how to come across as personable  (small talk doesn’t work well with me. And either i’m all in or not. It’s hard for me to play the game and toe the line and dance the social dance). And it’s not that I’m shy/socially awkward, it’s just inherent to my neurology. 

Based on my history as a dental assistant and emt, i can only either do the technical side of my job or the social aspect, never both. When I try both, both suffer quite badly because I need to go through the mental checklist of social requirements. I’m definitely open to trying both and seeing where the max limit is for me, but would business be a risky place to do that? Business is fairly demanding in the social aspect from what ive seen, and I know socially demanding jobs aren’t sustainable for me because acting in a socially comfortable manner for others is a whole other job for me to think about (it doesnt come naturally to me, and I often need to think about how to “act” things out). 

All that being said, would you say that i may be able to find a place for myself in business or environments where social factors are important? I’m quite comfortable at my startup right now because I’m allowed to be “odd” and it doesnt professionally harm me. 

Myth debunking request: Just how smooth do business people need to be? All the “business bros” I know are incredibly “smooth,” but full of bullshit and the dishonesty and lack of transparency is unbearable to me. I have also seen this in some people in corporate who use stereotypical corporate language, and it’s so bad that it gives me migraines and affects my health.


Eta: the stuff you said about roleplaying and learning small details for work? I have to do that everyday in my interactions to mask my autism, and I learned from being corrected and picked on. For me, my daily life is already socially highly demanding because i have to “act” unautistic. So i’m hesitant to dive even more into “acting” beyond what i already do daily because it might push me to the edge. Is there a place in business where I wouldnt have to do this? I have trouble with eye contact and Ive been reprimanded before about it in corporate environments. If i cant even do that, am i SOL?",fatFIRE,disorders

Routine for 3a, fine, medium porosity >>>

So first off going completely no-poo did NOT work for my hair. I wash my hair with a sulfate-free moisturizing shampoo about once or twice a week and co-wash the rest. 

I struggled with finding a routine for a LONG while because I have a lot of hair and assumed I should be using products for ""thick"" hair when in fact my hair strands are very fine, who knew? (Not me lol)

AM - Wet hair in shower, put a towel around until it's no longer dripping (like a minute) then brush through with the ""Wet brush"" and apply a SMALL (!!)  amount of leave in conditioner from middle to ends. I then put my head upside-down and gently scrunch while giving my head a bit of a shake. 
If I have time to air dry I will, and scrunch again with some argan oil into my ends once semi-dry.
 
I will sometimes use a diffuser but it makes my curls not as loose (which I prefer) 

Products - I'm Australian but have been using Iherb to buy my shampoo and conditioner (Giovanni smooth as silk Deep moisturiser shampoo/conditioner), my leave in conditioner (Kinky Curly Knot Today) and I have bought a couple of deep conditioners (no favourite) which I use about once a week/fortnight. 

I also sleep with my hair in a pineapple or loose bun every night :)

I have had to learn to feel comfortable with my hair being curly almost all occasions (still working on this) because even straightening it one time seems to make my curls sad.

username#00322,post,2021-07-12 01:12,[25M] Have been dealing with constant pain for the past year and a half but no real answers so far.,"About three years ago I had a bad car accident. My car was completely totalled but fortunately I didn't have any major injuries. I did have seat belt injuries but apart from that my MRI, ultrasound and x-rays showed no problems. However, since then I have had pain in my upper right side, i.e. my right shoulder, ribs, upper back, chest and at times my right hand. 

This pain gradually reduced since the accident as I kept going to the gym regularly and doing functional training and I was doing considerably well up until the pandemic started. Since then, I have not been to the gym, and this pain has gotten much worse day by day. Especially in the past few months when I wake up I feel dizzy and have to get up very carefully. When the pain flares up in my ribs it gets s bit difficult to breathe easily. I find this especially concerning as I have had Asthma by birth and although it is under control and i have not had any attacks in the past 14 years I still get very anxious about it. I have been to two orthopedic doctors and even a neurologist. They gave me prescriptions for physiotherapy and painkillers. I live in Germany now and with with the way the public health insurance system works every time I wanted to get more physiotherapy I had to go back to the doctor and then get an appointment for the physiotherapist. On average it would take me between 3 weeks to s month before I could actually get the physiotherapy. Sadly, even though I did get some pain relief from the physiotherapy and following the exercises recommended, the pain did not reduce in intensity or frequency. 

I have had 2 MRI scans, an ultrasound scan and a CT scan since October 2020 and have not found anything that directly correlates to the pain I am experiencing daily. These scans took place in Germany recently, where as the previous scans and the accident itself occured in Dubai in 2018.

While the most recent scans again showed nothing conclusive, I did get to know that I have scoliosis but that it is not something that is causing the problem. I was also told that I had tennis elbow but again that had nothing to do with the pain in my ribs, chest, neck and upper back. All the pain is focused on my right side. I am at my wit's end as I am tired of going to the doctor and not finding any clear answers. I have been taking novaminsulfon 500mg daily for the past month as this was the only thing the orthopedic doctor gave me. He did mention that perhaps I could go to an internal medicine doctor next but I am extremely frustrated and tired. This has been affecting my sleep and thus overall quality of life.  

I would be extremely grateful for any advice, insight or direction. Apart from this, I would like to add that I do not have any other health issues. I try to maintain a somewhat active lifestyle despite all the issues I have been having. I do not drink or smoke. I am 157cm tall and my weight is around 80kg. I have a stocky athletic build even though I am overweight, that is to say that I still have retained muscle mass. One of the rules mentioned adding race and I am not really sure how to answer that. I was born in Pakistan in the Punjab region. I look middle eastern however. I don't have any other chronic illnesses apart from asthma. While I have not been able to exercise much due to the tennis elbow I have been walking at least 12,000 to 16,000 steps every day. I live in Munich so finding doctors is not exactly an issue.

A friend is going through some rough stuff and when she was relaying it to her dad, she started to cry. And instead of offering any comfort...he just changed the subject.

I remember my dad when I was a kid and admittedly, when I grew up, it was NOT an emotional household. Matter of fact, of all the men in the extended family, I could count the number of times *any* of them cried on both hands . My dad included. 

But then I grew up. I entered college extremely depressed and years later, it all made sense when I was diagnosed bipolar II. 

From college until he passed 10 years later, I could call him and cry about *anything* and he never shamed me, he never judged and he always offered comfort, advice and words of wisdom. While he wasn't super emotive with his feelings , he had tremendous empathy, he loved me endlessly and when I hurt, he hurt. 

I think my favorite quote from him came at a time where things weren't going well in life, work or my marriage. I cried as I said ""Dad, it just all feels so *hopeless."" And he said ""Aw, kiddo, there's *always* hope - sometimes you just have to figure out where it's hiding.""

username#00326,comment,2024-02-25 13:02,,"I’m on the waiting list for an assessment and I thought a similar way initially. However, when trying to explain things to people in my life and consistently saying “I think I’m autistic” people usually interpret that as me looking for reassurance that I’m not in fact autistic. 9/10 times someone’s response will be “you don’t look autistic” or “I don’t think you’re autistic” but they’re saying it in a way they think is nice or kind. With people who I’m close to I’ve used this as a way to open the conversation to explain autism and masking etc. A lot of the times people have a very outdated/incorrect view of the definition of autism or maybe know one person who is autistic and assume that since I’m not the exact same as them then I must not be autistic. 

Now, if I’m not interested in having an in depth conversation and explaining autism to the person who I’m talking to I simply say “I’m autistic” if it is important to explain in conversation, because it is exhausting having to explain to people what this means and slightly hurtful when people think I’m saying it as an insult to myself or autism in general. I don’t see the benefit of hearing someone who knows less about autism than I do explain why they don’t think I have autism when medical professionals and therapists think I should be assessed for autism and I think I should be assessed for autism, just because the waiting list is so long.

Edit: In conclusion, people tend to interpret the “I think” part of the statement as me not being educated on the subject and just guessing and feel it is opening a conversation for them to say what they think. Majority of the time I don’t care what they think about if I have autism or not, or it’s not the time for an in depth discussion about it. Just saying “I’m autistic” reduces the unfavourable responses immensely and allows for the conversation to not result in me having to tell them personal information about myself.",autism,disorders

Thank you all for coming. Let me start by saying that it is such an honor to officiate this marriage – a marriage between two wonderful people who are close friends of mine.

I have known GROOM for over a decade. We met in college and over the years, GROOM has become one of my closest friends. I met BRIDE in 2017 after they began dating. I quickly realized they are perfect for each other.

GROOM is X, Y, and Z, and BRIDE is charming, funny, and down to earth.
As a couple, they share strengths that keep their relationship strong, and I'd like to share some of those with you now.


 1. Their first strength is balance – Their strengths and abilities complement each other so that the whole is greater than the individual. 

 2. The second strength is patience – They each seem to have the ability to be calm when the other needs it.

 3. The third strength is their shared sense of humor – Both GROOM and BRIDE are able to laugh at themselves and each other and they always seem to be having a great time together. They told me earlier that despite two years of Covid lockdown together, they never grew tired of each other’s company and always had a good time together.

To me, it looks like you are in a state of **hypervigilance** leading you to be paranoid over every ""new"" symptoms that you may be feeling. (English is not my first language so I'm sorry if I can't explain properly, but I'm trying).

You need to get back on your thyroid med ASAP. Some of the symptoms you are experiencing are likely due to you being off your meds. You also need to have a good conversation with your psychiatrist. When it comes to medication for mental health issues, it can be really hard to find the molecules that work for you. 

Instead of stopping your medication by yourself, keep a journal of how your medication makes you feel. What works and doesn't work. Then you tell your psychiatrist and it is **his** job to come up with another solution. It took me almost 10 years to find what works for me and even to this day, I still need my psychiatrist to adjust my meds every 6 months or so.

I also think you would benefit from seeing a therapist. You have a lot of anxiety and you need help to deal with that. I feel a lot of pain and concern from your posts. Anxiety is a hell of a problem and if not taken care of, it can lead to physical symptoms, and you will most likely develop an ulcer or even heart problems over time.

I think you should also consider IBS for your physical symptoms. These past few months, I've been dealing with chronical abdominal pain. I've had lots of tests and everything came back normal. Anxiety is powerful and can increase IBS pain. I've read all your previous posts, and I experienced a lot of your symptoms. IBS was my final diagnosis and now I'm on a medication that helps with abdominal cramping. In the span of a week, my pain has become manageable and I can now go back to work.

The system is shit for everyone, true, but there are layers of stress and struggle added when you are an immigrant. If you don’t produce money, you’re out. The fear of losing my family here and then become homeless and die is just too much. I’ll be 33y at the end of the month and I'm not sure I'll make it. Not suicidal, just fucking exhausted. And all I’m asking for is a non-monetary accommodation: to study/work (mostly) from home.

Good point about the idea of fairness. I've noticed the same. In theory, great. It wouldn't be a bad thing if it was actually implemented correctly and, pun intended, in a fair way. I mean, it's unfair if your friend or me miss some lectures to be able to keep up in general, but it's not unfair if we are left behind on life because of it? Ridiculous, isn't it? I'm really sorry they had to go through this bs. And everyone else you know who also went through this idiocy. The alcohol situation... for fuck's sake. I'm glad things seem to turn out better than expected.

But it's indeed a good point to consider that will help us on the next meeting with the institutional education and TE Toimisto. I almost forgot it for a moment, so thank you for reminding me that.

I'm non-verbal, yes. I don't know sign language, unfortunately, as I was able to speak in the past. I'm capable of work or study, but just need a little adjustments that don't affect anyone else nor cost any money. I did work here previously. I got sick. Lost the job. I have been stuck in unemployment ever since. I have been failed from the beginning not because of the lack of funds, and even more so nowadays with this government, but because of lack of information or lack of redirection from almost everyone I crossed paths with (which I'm sure it's a problem in general, not a me-thing). Then the more exhausted I get from the situation, the harder is to come out of it without proper practical help and proper consideration for my needs.

I confess I don't know much about academia. I think Education is great and I wish I had the chance to get proper education, but education as it is currently, especially higher or specialized, it's not accessible. Not just a Finland's problem, as that happened over there as well and I'm sure in other places. But yeah, accommodations will be needed, regardless of someone being autistic, disabled or not. There are many ways to learn; we can't really move positively forward as a society if we don't recognize that and instead create what I call disability instances, when we could be leaning into that as a strength. It's sad, really. And it makes me mad.

* You can drop a letter or postcard either at a post office or at a post box;
* All you need to buy is a stamp, or stamps, and glue it on the right upper side of the envelope or postcard
* You can use the calculator here, but once you start it's fairly easy to know what costs what [https://www.indiapost.gov.in/VAS/Pages/CalculatePostage.aspx](https://www.indiapost.gov.in/VAS/Pages/CalculatePostage.aspx)
* I can check much on the phone but if it's like any other post service website, you might check what stamps are available; they can also tell you at the post office.

For letters, a regular envelope suffices, but you can also check online to learn how to do yours! For postcards, no need to send in a envelope, although you can send more than on inside an envelope, of course. Usually the price is regarding the grams (usually up to 20g, then next level up to 50g, but these are european standards I use an example - I'm sure they have this info on the website).

Cons: trans healthcare is gatekeepy, outdated, inaccessible and traumatising. Healthcare in general is dismissive and most of the people I dealt with were transphobic. I do not have access to anything so far.

Pros: irl people won’t bother me unlike where I come from (southern Europe) where people don’t respect personal boundaries, trans-related or otherwise.

I know I won’t become homeless here, which is comforting, but at the same time there is nothing aimed at queer/trans immigrants and, from my perspective, there isn’t much vocal activism (but maybe I’m indeed missing something because of language barriers), which is kinda lonely. I’m thinking of creating an inclusive place for trans immigrants, especially neurodivergents like me, but I’m still trying to figure out how to do it when I have a bunch of things going on (unemployment, disabilities, immigration, etc).

Despite this, I do feel safer here than in other places where I’ve lived (southern and central Europe). At least in a physical level ( not being attacked, looked at, etc).

I don’t struggle with the social loneliness that many extroverted/neurotypical immigrants struggle with, as my autistic ass does not really enjoy that either way, but I do struggle with the sense of lack of community and inclusion for people like me. 

Is Finland beautiful? I think so. Many trees everywhere. Sometimes I see squirrels and foxes and big bunnies right in front of me. I don’t really travel much because we struggle with the moneys, but at least I’m not bothered when walking down the street.

Google translate might help. Asking for help from a native speaker on the forum also helps. But ultimately it’s NOT mandatory to write in anything else other than English (or in a shared language) and one shouldn’t be pressured to do extra work.

I don't really miss a social life because I never had one, but I used to feel very lonely because I wasn't able to relate with the social culture and people over there, but here there is no pressure to be extroverted, fake or rush interactions, so it makes me feel at ease.

Here I feel safe even when I'm struggling a lot with my current work/money situation. There are systems in place to help me, even though it's not perfect and sometimes I have to fight my way to get the answers and help that I need - but at least I have the chance to get them.

I ""understand"" that for most people it's a hard country to live in in social terms. It's not for me, thankfully.

username#00335,comment,2023-12-29 18:09,,"Hi! We did this for Christmas and it was a success among our Finnish Family and a neighbor. I thought I could share the recipe here, but first you need to read my whole life story. JUST KIDDING I'm not a food blogger 😅

Some context: Brigadeiros are traditional brazilian sweets. I'm not from Brazil, but they are very appreciated in Portugal (where I'm from - no, I'm not the guy on the other post who is complaining about MIGRI)

Also, to my Brazilian friends, this was not an attempt to destroy your gastronomic culture, but to appreciate it (and mine) and share it with my finnish family 😊

The left side are the traditional ones (chocolate) and also with coconut flakes. The middle and right side pictures are the ones with salmiakki.

&#x200B;

# RECIPE (please check an original recipe online for your preferred quantities)

&#x200B;

1. In a pot over low heat, melt the butter, condensed milk, and cocoa powder, stirring continuously until you can see the bottom of the pot for 2-3 seconds when dragging a spatula through.
2. Pour onto a greased plate, then chill for an hour or two.
3. Shape and roll the chilled mixture into balls, but put your preferred liquorice/salmiakki piece inside it.
4. Roll the balls in liquorice powder.

&#x200B;

You can try to do this with coffee powder too (instead of the cocoa mixture when cooking), but I don't know if that combination would go well on this experimental recipe.

Enjoy!",Finland,nationalities

I've been living in Finland since 2020. I have some doubts regarding my transness and how to proceed about them due to my immigrant status. For context: I'm in the system and I even have a Finnish ID.

&#x200B;

1. Can I change my name here or am I dependent of my home country?
2. Can I change my whole name or just the forename?
3. Do I need to change my gender on the ID? I'm afab transmasculine person.
4. Are there any activities/groups welcoming of trans immigrants? I'm in Turku, but online works for me too as I'm an introvert and sometimes I struggle with social things.

I was wondering if anyone has a similar experience and what did you do about it?

I'm asking here because every time I ask something from doctors, social workers or other people (about many things in my life, not only trans-related), they never seem to know the right answers because I'm an immigrant, so this status has been impacting my life here and I was wondering if it would impact my transition or not. Did anyone went through the same?

If there is anything I should be aware of that I didn't ask, please let me know too. Thanks in advance!

I cannot take when co-workers use that word in some hierarchical and submissive manner, especially when talking to me and implying that we have to answer obediently to someone who is *""above""* us.

For me there are no bosses, just people with different responsibilities. My responsibility might be taking care of a specific task and their responsibility might be supervise if I do such task as I'm supposed to, but that doesn't mean the person owns me or holds any kind of power over me.

I had a very bad childhood. The short and thick of it was my dad was emotionally abusive my whole childhood and I was severely physically & sexually abused out of the home as a kid that left me with multiple physical issues and disabilities. I won’t go into them but I had to drop out of school and I won’t ever be able to hold a traditional job. It was rough with my mom for a while, I blamed her for not noticing that I was being abused (years after I had gotten out and was finally safe at 18 it finally came out of me and I’ve been getting so much medical treatment since and will continue to need it, 3 surgeries down at least 2 more to go) and I still do to some extent. She blames herself enough for both of us I think. Since she found out she has been doing every single thing to take care of me and she has admitted she can never make up what happened and she knows that, but she will spend the rest of her life trying. We always wanted to be close but she had to work horrific hours my whole childhood and we both had to navigate abuse from my dad. With a lot of issues at home, it went completely unnoticed because I was always the kid no one had to worry about because of how “good and mature” I was. She finally kicked my dad out over a year ago now and things have gotten even better. I’m still highly struggling with staying alive, but she’s doing everything she possibly can to keep me alive. 


We’ve gotten much closer over the years and have a pretty good relationship now. She indulges my every wish (within reason but my mom’s reason is very extravagant) as long as I do my best to stay alive, it’s a good deal. I’ve gotten pretty spoiled I must admit although she insists I can never be spoiled because I am too grateful and too deserving. I’m not quite sure about that. I also hold an insane amount of guilt from it all. We work hard to try and ease each other’s guilt with love and just move forward. That’s not easy with CPTSD, but you do your best. 


Because of her, I’ve gotten to go to pretty much every concert I’ve wanted to in recent history (since 2021 I’ve been to 7 concerts in between surgeries, and I have another in August). She also loves my music taste so it does work out. She’s gotten me to meet my favorite musician in the whole world 3 times through sheer willpower (Frank Iero you are one of the greatest and kindest men alive, also to Anthony Green who I also got to meet you are so incredibly wonderful and our conversation meant the world to me). She loves animals just as much as I do so we have quite the herd of rescue pets which definitely also helps our relationship. I can’t fully explain how much our pets help, but they damn well know what they’re doing and it’s working. I also have 6 gorgeous tattoos thanks to her, and many more planned. In short, she works really hard to show her love for me now and I do my best too. 


Since all of that, I’d say we have a really good relationship today. It’s been really really hard, especially with how sick I still am and will be for a while. I have so many issues, SO many, and I don’t really know how or why she does it. I am really grateful for everything she does for me and I am not sure I deserve any of it. But I think all that matters is we work hard to keep going and make each other happy.

My name is Sander. I live in Belgium and work full-time at the service desk of a small company that makes accounting software.

Bored you yet? Probably...

As you can imagine that line of work makes escapism one of my favorite pass-times. One only has to check my profile to notice I'm pretty active member of the /r/worldbuilding community. Which is where I spend a lot of time trying to develop a fantasyworld for a novel I am writing.

Like almost every nerdy teenager I once had the dream to write a novel. Several months ago I stopped developing a story and started writing it.

It has been a harrowing experience and I constantly have to remind myself that first drafts are usually shit. Which in my case definitely is true.

I'm seeking someone who has an interest in writing and storytelling as well. Someone who I won't bore or annoy when I go on a rant about story ideas I have, but will be honest when they are shit. Of course the quid-pro-quo is that I'd do the same for any works you may be developing.

I've got a thing where I'm not really sharing my writing until it is finished, and it probably won't be finished until half my brain rots away from the stress. That being said, don't expect me to sen you huge chunks of text to review. I'm looking for someone to chat with not an editor.

Other than that I'm just looking for a person who enjoys writing, the nerdy side of things whether it's Dungeons and Dragons, Doctor Who or what latest discovery NASA made.

Age? Doesn't really matter. I'm 29 which means I'm inevitably stuck in the pergatory between being young and an old bag. So I can relate to quite a bit of people.

Sex? I'm a straight male guy, but this isn't a search for a partner. So whatever gender or orientation you identify with: I'm open to chatting.

My name is Sander. I live in Belgium and work full-time at the service desk of a small company that makes accounting software.

Bored you yet? Probably... 

As you can imagine that line of work makes escapism one of my favorite pass-times. One only has to check my profile to notice I'm pretty active member of the /r/worldbuilding community. Which is where I spend a lot of time trying to develop a fantasyworld for a novel I am writing.

Like almost every nerdy teenager I once had the dream to write a novel. Several months ago I stopped developing a story and started writing it.

It has been a harrowing experience and I constantly have to remind myself that first drafts are usually shit. Which in my case definitely is true.

I'm seeking someone who has an interest in writing and storytelling as well. Someone who I won't bore or annoy when I go on a rant about story ideas I have, but will be honest when they are shit. Of course the quid-pro-quo is that I'd do the same for any works you may be developing.

I've got a thing where I'm not really sharing my writing until it is finished, and it probably won't be finished until half my brain rots away from the stress. That being said, don't expect me to sen you huge chunks of text to review. I'm looking for someone to chat with not an editor. 

Other than that I'm just looking for a person who enjoys writing, the nerdy side of things whether it's Dungeons and Dragons, Doctor Who or what latest discovery NASA made.

""Ok Google, set up a radio alarm""

""Ok, when should I set the alarm?""

""One minute from now.""

""Ok, which station should I play?""

""... station.""

""Got it, I'll play ... for...""

username#00351,post,2018-08-04 21:48,28[M4R] Belgium - Nerdy writer. Amateur Historian. Professional dnd-player seeking conversation.,"Hello there.


It's saturday night and I'm bored. It happens quite a bit to a housecat like myself. I'm not much for going out and so I end up playing 4 or so matches on Overwatch before giving up on the dream of ever ""getting gud"" and ending up on reddit to make a personals post.

A little about me: I'm Belgian. That means that I will cut you if you refer to fries as french, but I will do so with a shiv made of chocolate... So honestly in this heat that's a pointless threat.

I live in the Dutch speaking part of the country and I'm pretty much only able to communicate my lack of french communication skills in french. So if you are from the netherlands and want to have a chat? Ga ervoor.

I'm currently looking for someone to just chat with. Not just for tonight, but to just from time to  time vent to. If you are near my place of residence I'll be open to perhaps meeting or who knows what else...

But let me clear and say that this post, at least for the current purpose is entirely platonic.

I'm a single straight male that is looking for something more romantic, but that's an entirely different post I don't feel like writing now.

Here's what you need to know about me:

I work fulltime and it stresses me out sometimes. I like to complain about my job, which involves a lot of customers and a lot of computers. However as much as I complain, it's not that I hate my job. It's just that I hate certain days on the job.

I have a dream of being a writer. Currently that dream maniftests itself in unfinished ideas or a tendency to start hating anything I work long term on. I need to figure out a way to motivate myself to creating more.

I like a lot of stories and will probably keep suggesting books, tv-shows, games or movies to watch, read or entertain yourself with. When I discover a good story I can't really keep it to myself and I can gush away about great storytellers.

Currently I'm reading a lot of Terry Pratchett... 

As I said I'm looking for some pleasant conversation about just about anything. 

Whether it's your favorite part of history, whether pineapple belongs on pizza or what the ending of the Leftovers meant.

I'm up for anything.

Looking for some suggestions.,"So a couple of days ago I was asked by my boss if I was okay with travelling to Berlin to aid a client. Now I live in Belgium so it isn't uncommon that I have to go abroad, Berlin probably ending up being the furthest. I'll be there for a week and only have workstuff planned the first day. I paid some of my own money to extend my time there and make it a holiday. I don't mind solotraveling and I am quite curious about the city itself. 

I have booked a free walking tour, made sure to get a legendary Donër Kebab and looked at some interesting museums.

In spite of its legendary nightlife, I'm pretty much a hermit. I don't like crowds and if I don't know anyone brave enough to drag me along, I won't have a good time at a club. 

So with that in mind. Knowing I'm a huge history nerd and enjoy quiet evenings, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.

Perhaps if someone's in the region, I wouldn't mind meeting up to visit some locations.

A comic I've been working for the past 3 years. Fantasy meets post-apocalyptic. It shows a world where people become gods if they die, and what happens if everyone becomes immortal. 

**Work done on it**

Currently I have drafted about 10 issues. Scripted 2 and currently the first issue is being drawn.

My plan is to get the first issue done by June and hopefully published (online or through some other medium) by August.

**Lettering details**

For the first issue I'm seeking someone to letter 20 pages.

This includes dialogue and sound-effects.

I'm offering a flat rate of 15 USD per page or 300 USD for the entire comic. 320 if any additional lettering on the cover is required.

This will be paid on the paypal account of your choice. Half before and half after.



**Some more details**

I'd prefer someone who seeks repeating work as I'm willing to continue paying for each additional issue.

Since I live in Belgium most of the communication will have to happen online and over e-mail.

Some of the dialogue may require writing in some gibberish due to language-differences. 

Send me a sample of your work and any questions you may have.

I have backups already, so I'm just now sitting here hoping it won't die on me. However after googling the problem, I also discovered it could be scareware.

A week or so back, I posted a similar thread asking for help with rootkits found on my laptop. These rootkits don't show up anymore during scanning and I thought I got rid of them. Now I'm considering the possibility that this might be a rootkit's doing. How can I check?

My budget is around 200-400€ and I live in Finland (EU). One pair that popped up pretty often in my research is the Audeze Maxwell, but I want to know if there are ones that may fit my needs better and if they're a good choice. I mainly do gaming, though I do listen to some music as well, in my eyes (or ears) if they're good for gaming they're also good for music, so no specific requirements on that front.

Wants:  
Wireless. Closed back. Over-ear (for comfort). All-day battery life, so around 24h or more just to be safe (they could be used for 16 hours/day). They must obviously be comfortable, for reference I've tried the Logitech G Pro X Wireless, Steelseries Arctis 7 & Nova Pro Wireless, and they were all uncomfortable, my current headset (Razer Nari Ultimate) is very comfortable for me.

Don't want/need:  
Must NOT be Razer, as I've had so many issues with their products. I don't need a mic. I don't want sidetone.

I will be staying in Rennes and I'd like to travel around the city somewhat cheaply, I know walking is a great option but a lot of the places I'd like to visit are at least a 50 minute walk. I saw that there's a bike sharing program from STAR, and it looks like for around 52 euro I can get a one month pass that includes bike and bus? Is this one of the best options available or is there some other metro transit system I'm missing? Are the busses generally pretty reliable or will I mostly be relying on the bike?

Also, regarding COVID restrictions, I'm fully vaccinated and I have both booster shots, do I need to bring my original vaccine card or will they accept a photocopy as long as it shows my name and I have ID? I'm also travelling with a friend and he lost his original vaccine card, but we both have the [""excelsior pass""](https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/excelsior-pass-and-excelsior-pass-plus) which is a NYC app that shows your vaccine status, would that be good enough?

username#00369,comment,2024-01-12 16:06,,"I’m American and I went in March 2023 (just Havana) so I think that may be recent enough to provide some thoughts:

1.	⁠You’ll need to figure out getting the tourist visa beforehand to qualify for a visit as an American. I went under the auspices of ‘support for the Cuban people,’ and this doesn’t require any exceptional proof, and the visa isn’t difficult to get from any number of Cuba-specific travel companies. The card that you will be sent does not have specific dates on it, those are filled in once you arrive in Cuba, so you can buy these well in advance (I had mine for two years before I was able to go because of the pandemic).
2.	⁠As part of the requirements for qualifying for Support for the Cuban People, you will technically be eligible for an audit by the US government for any receipts from your trip for a period of five years. Since hotels are owned by the Cuban government, staying in them as an American is considered funding the Cuban government, and not allowed. Your work-around here is by staying in ‘casas particolares’ or airbnbs, and this is quite easy and they are plentiful and cheap.
3.	⁠There is a special exchange levy placed on American dollars of 10%, as opposed to exchanging other currencies such as Euros for much lower. Your best option is to change your dollars in the US and bring Euros with you instead. Bear in mind that many of the taxi drivers in Havana to and from the airport will almost demand that you pay in either US dollars or euros, and I couldn’t find anyone willing to go lower than 30€ one-way.
4.	⁠Regarding money, you will get an exchange rate that is about 5X better by changing money via the black market than at an exchange counter (so say, 125 pesos per euro instead of 25). I went this route via my Airbnb host who offered to do this for me, but YMMV based on whether or not you feel comfortable doing this. Cuba is also extremely bureaucratic so be prepared for this task to take up a good chunk of time should you do so yourself.
5.	⁠Further about money, all American credit and debit cards are blocked in Cuba, so whatever money you plan on spending will need to come with you in cash when you arrive. And once it’s gone, you may be able to jump through hoops to get more via Western Union, but this is a big if.
6.	⁠Dining and Entertainment in Havana is not as cheap as one might expect. I was surprised at how prices felt comparable to eating in an American city. Ditto cigars and rum if you’re buying from reputable places. Like in American cities, there’s obviously a range of price points, but it definitely wasn’t as cheap as expected or as cheap as the airbnbs.
7.	⁠Be prepared to attract a lot of constant attention from people haggling you to exchange money, buy cigars, etc. It felt similar to some of my travels in India where I felt like I had a bullseye on my back. Some people would follow for ten-fifteen minutes telling me stories about how their sick mom had run out of medicine and needed money. It could very well be true and you may be inclined to help, but if this is something that would bother you, be forewarned. As a single male I was also propositioned for sex on a few occasions by women and could see the pimp just lingering a few yards away. This was on the Malecon, so prime tourist area, not anywhere dodgy.
8.	⁠Be very vigilant about the water. I brought back a nasty infection despite being extremely careful.
9.	⁠If you’ve never traveled anywhere with extreme poverty before, do consider whether that would factor into your enjoyment. You will see LOTS of crumbling buildings, extremely poor infrastructure, people waiting in lines for food with their ration cards, etc. (another note: you will not have access to grocery stores in Cuba, so bring any necessities with you). It’s a very real part of the equation that the average Cuban lives on $30/month, and you will see this up close and personal. It can be a mood or sense of heaviness and despair that is jarring when you contrast with the tourist-heavy areas, so just be aware that it’s present.
10.	⁠On the other hand, the people are extremely friendly and hospitable and probably the highlight of any visit. The culture is rich and there’s much to discover and learn just by conversing and hearing from locals their stories and experiences. Add in the music and food, and there’s a lot of joy to be had.
11.	⁠It certainly felt very safe. I never felt like I needed to take any precautions aside from common sense ones I would take anywhere.
12.	⁠American SIM cards are also blocked, so if you want to use WiFi you will need to secure a pre-paid internet card with a login code that allows you internet for a designated amount of time. My host gave me one with five hours of internet time, which I used to check messages, etc., each night (be sure to log off to stop the clock!); but you won’t have 24/7 internet access which is either appealing or not depending on your perspective.
13.	⁠The Havana airport is a bit chaotic. My flight left three hours late for no announced reason, despite the departure time never being updated on the timetable. I was a bit convinced the flight had just been silently canceled until the crew started setting up hours later. Again, no announcement of any delay. Also, bring toilet paper as the airport bathroom doesn’t have much if any.
14.	⁠When you come back through US customs, they will ask you if you are bringing any rum or cigars. I wasn’t, but theoretically these aren’t allowed so be aware they will ask you.

I would absolutely recommend a trip to Cuba, and going there isn’t difficult per se, but it is still for the more adventurous traveler and requires a significant amount of planning. Totally worth it, but also a good idea to think about it and be sure you want to before casually booking a trip. My European and Canadian friends had vastly different takes on how comfortable it was to visit, so being American does present specific challenges logistically, but I don’t feel it caused any issues interacting on the ground with locals.

Any more questions just ask.",u_ramenmoodles,"nationalities, nationalities"

I'm no expert, but based on my experiences it seems like bipolar highs and lows tend to last longer than BPD ones, and aren't usually triggered by ""small"" things like a one-off comment from a friend or loved one.

username#00372,comment,2021-11-08 00:22,,"Okay - you got me thinking. Below is my current server. (I had the help of this community cause I honestly cant piece parts together) I love what I have and realistically only need to expand it to a total of 16TB so 3 more HDs that are 4 TB each. (which will give me five HDs all 4TB each).

What is the best way to expand my current set up (below) into one that can house 3 more hard drives? Im thinking I buy the case noted above and maybe a new PSU. Would I need a new motherboard as it says ""RAID SUPPORT = NO""? It has 8 sata 6Gb/s slots so I think I am good there. I also dont know (I will have to research) how to expand my current pools and/or convert everything to a RAIDZ1 configuration. I believe right now it is just mirrored.

You got me thinking and I was honestly being foolish wanting to build a completely brand new server with so much HDs. 64TB is huge for a plex media server where I do not maintain movies for the long run. I currently use 3 TB out of 4TB but I would like to be able to have some more TV series that are huge (think Stargate SG1, Dexter, ER, etc).

If you have any advice on a better subreddit to post in I am down for doing that as well. THANKS in advance for your time.

I hit the lottery and didn't run into the 110C Junction issue, but my driver's or card are not so lucky.

When using my 7900XTX I experience full PC reboot crashes. I have several logs I have submitted to AMD from Adrenaline.

I have a Corsair HX1000i Platinum PSU brand new. Entire rig is brand new as of 12/25.

I'm on an ASUS X670E Prime Pro Wifi, BIOS are up to date.

I DDU'd the drivers twice and had no luck. Still hard crashing my computer randomly.

I'm not overclocking anything in my PC as I was trying to keep maximum stability when the crashing started.

I switched back to my old 1080Ti and have had zero issues, so I'm pretty convinced the issue is the card or the drivers.

I'm not able to get the system to crash using 3DMark, Furmark, or OCCT. It seems to be entirely random and crashes at any moment. All of my PC components as well as the GPU pass OCCT stability also.

My Card really doesn't like HDMI as when my HDMI cable is plugged i can replicate a crash, but one monitor goes Green. Hard Crashing has occurred with any configuration.

I've tried different monitors and different cables. Only thing I can't be certain is if I have Pin20 DP cables, but crashing has occurred on only HDMI.

The only blue screen I ever got from windows said ""KERNEL POWER FAILURE"" which pointed me in the directly of reseating my GPU and RAMM which I did and stress testing my PSU which I did using OCCT.

I'm honestly just praying there are settings anywhere that anyone knows that might fix this before I refund and go back to green team, cause I was honestly so excited for this GPU.

I've been dealing with this for a week.

Any help is greatly appreciated.",radeon,disorders

username#00378,post,2021-04-04 22:47,M1070s arrived today! Time to do a write-up.,"This is a direct follow-up to my previous thread on my experience with the Monolith M1060Cs and Monoprice support over the past few years. [Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/m6tqk9/my_experience_with_monolith_m1060cs_and/)'s the original thread.  

Let's start off by saying that I didn't think I'd get the headphones today! At 3:30AM, the FedEx tracking number showed that the package was on a FedEx vehicle for delivery. After refreshing about thirty minutes later, the page had updated to saying it was scheduled to be delivered tomorrow. I was disappointed, but I knew that it was a bit fishy for it to say that. At the normal time FedEx delivers at my place, I was greeted by a delivery message. My girlfriend said it was the most excited she'd heard me in years when I told her I'd be right back.  

First things first, considering build quality was such a massive issue with my M1060Cs, I was expecting a big difference with these. And let me say, each and every problem I had with the M1060Cs has been fixed. The new headband is comfortable. It's no pillow cushion or anything, but it's remarkably better than the terrible headband that was the M1060 series. Second, the 3.5mm jacks that plug into the headphones are much, much better than the 2.5mm jacks on the M1060Cs. No more having to put an absurd amount of pressure into getting them into the ports. It's just a simple click and they're snug. The cables being angled is a nice bonus, but I never had a problem with them being downward facing beforehand. They're not as heavy as the M1060Cs, which is great, and they're a bit more snug on the head. Still not snug enough to bend over without risking them falling off.  

EDIT: It's come to my attention that my initial sound impressions before EQ may have been so poor because my amp may not be strong enough. Regardless, after EQ, I've never been so pleased with a product, and would 100% recommend these headphones if you don't mind using an EQ!

Initial sound impressions were... really bad. First thing I noticed is that they sounded remarkably comparable to my Sennheiser HD 558s that I had been using during RMA. I was shocked at how bad they sounded. I kept telling myself that I just needed to get used to them. That I was too used to my M1060Cs and that maybe I was seeing such obvious comparisons to my HD558s because I had been using them for a while.  

I was disappointed, but I did notice a lot of clarity. Like, crystal-clear clarity on pretty much everything. I was really disappointed in the bass response, but then I realized that the bass wasn't necessarily bad - it just wasn't as profound as it was in the 1060Cs. I have a FiiO E10K for my AMP/DAC. This is with the bass boost switch flipped on. When it's flipped off, it's so resoundingly flat, but it has a lot of clarity. I can't lie about that.  

After a bit of browsing on here, I saw a user talking about how they don't like EQ. That's when I realized, I read that the M1070s are remarkably good when EQ'd. So, I checked the sidebar for everything EQ related. I saw there was no preset for M1070s in the preset list just yet, and I figured that there wouldn't be too much harm in just copying the M1570's preset just to try it out.  

Oh. My. God. It completely blew my mind at how much better they sound once EQ'd. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/BNB1kCx.png)'s what my EQ settings look like, for any of you who have M1070s and might want to try it themselves. I increased the bass channel quite a bit, and lowered the treble slightly. The result is easily one of the most incredible, enjoyable experiences in my life. Each and every song sounds so incredible. So, so much better than my M1060Cs.  

I had never messed with EQs before, as I've heard bad things about using them. How it's not the ""true"" sound or whatever else. I wonder how differently my M1060Cs would have sounded if I had an EQ preset for them.  

It's difficult to come up with the words to describe just how incredible these headphones sound. It's also impossible for me to compare them to anything, because I haven't had anything but HD 558s, DT 770 Pros 250 Ohms, and my M1060Cs. I can't give a proper comparison to their competitors, such as Audeze or Hifiman, but what I can say is that these headphones are hypnotizing.  

I'm stunned, because when I originally unboxed my M1070s, they were potentially the worst, most disappointing sounding headphones I've ever had. When a pair of HD 558s from 2015 sound comparable, despite the clarity differences, I was pretty upset.  

However, once EQ'd, these headphones sound literally mind blowing. The clarity of everything, plus the powerful bass is such a wonderful experience. I've put on all varieties of music to test them out, and it's remarkable how great every single piece of music sounds.  

If for some reason you wouldn't want to EQ these bad boys, stay far away from buying them. Far, far away. But if you are ready to have one of the most powerful and exhilarating musical experiences of your life, get $400 ready. Expensive, but damn, easily worth it. I'm so thankful I was upgraded to these in the end instead of having a THIRD replacement pair of M1060Cs.  

Sorry if my write up isn't factual enough or anything. This is my first time doing a write up for headphones and I'm not exactly a reviewer. Just someone who loves music like the rest of us here and wants the best possible experience. I can answer any questions!",headphones,disorders

username#00386,comment,2022-09-05 11:33,,"I've lived here a bit over 3 years, I have rough Czech and I am working on it (slowly).  All this to say that I agree you got bad luck to hit these all in a short visit... But they're *not* fundamentally unusual behaviors.

Lots of employees all around the world have bad attitudes and will absolutely say ""it's not my job to help you figure that out, now kindly fuck off"" but Czech republic may have a higher percentage of these than baseline from our experience, I've seen it in coworkers and I've seen it as a customer.  But we've also had some extremely helpful people who have absolutely gone out of their way to help us and were absolute joys.

Every country we've been in has rude assholes they will yell ""you're in ____ learn to speak _____ or get out"" but Czech people are sorta well established as particularly xenophobic (which they are usually very insistent about the differences between that and racism).  I've been in a conversation with someone in my limited czech and they switch to English to make things easier.  I then see someone walk up to them and ask if they speak English, and they will straight face respond ""Ne!"" and then turn around and ignore them.

The metro/tram rules are very hard line, yes there are no hard barriers, it's simply a marked area, if you're in that area you have to have a valid ticket. I've been on the metro, underground, with an e-ticket on my phone, and when I couldn't connect to the server's because we were, you know, underground, to show that I had a valid ticket, I was fined for not having a ticket. Even after going to the transportation office to show that I had an annual pass and explaining why I couldn't show my pass due to the lack of connection, the ticket was simply downgraded to ""failure to provide proof of a valid ticket.""  I've seen them fine people that are standing at a ticket machine on the tram, as some people will use ""oh I'm trying to buy a ticket"" as an excuse to sit there for 90 seconds while the tram travels two stops and then they just hop off.  Were you taking a long time trying to figure out what ticket you needed? With contactless payments those ticket machines do 1 thing and you can buy your ticket in under 10 seconds, it's push one button, tap your card.  I understand that it takes some time to figure that out the first time you see it, but it's still pretty fast.

TL;DR anywhere in the world is going to be totally different based on the people you interact with, and every country has jerks.  I've met some amazing people and have made great Czech friends here. But I do think in general the czech are definitely colder than many other cultures we have visited over the years, sorry you had a lot of bad luck.

A.  Is the ministry of health the right place to call about problems with my tečka not showing my vaccine? They have pages about tečka, but searching around I can't find a single link about what to do if you have problems with your tečka.  
B.  If I try to call the ministry of health, chances of getting someone that can actually speak english are rough, just speaking from my previous experience interacting with government type offices.  
C.  If I call, the chances that I'll actually be calling the right department that could try to help me aren't great, instead I'll probably need to be transferred, where again I have to cross my fingers that every person I get transferred to is someone that can speak english.

Has anyone had problems with their tečka not showing their vaccine?  I've looked around the mzcr site and haven't seen anything where I could email to try to get support.  I even have a Belgian friend with a Czech boyfriend, her tečka had the same problem, he has called mzcr multiple times spending multiple hours each time where each time it apparently results in him hearing ""Ok, it should show up in her Tečka by Friday"" only for Friday to come around and there be nothing.

While that would normally be catastrophic to most humans, it seems it merely causes mental sluggishness, this clearly shows that Terry Crews has superhuman durability, [regenerative powers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fNYFp1VCX8) and the ability to freely regain abilities/memories such as the ability to speak english without issue. He also shows shapeshifting, [batman-ish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbmq0Mcwg0o) technology, and a clear ability to break the fourth wall. His ability to destroy and create solar objects seemingly at will also shows a power that is possessed by only a few characters in all of comic book lore.

For DC I would say that he would rank just under the god tier, which means he can probably beat anyone except Superman, Batman and one offs like white lantern Kyle Rayner. Opposite reasons on the first two, Terry Crews has not shown the top-tier planning/mental abilities of Batman, likely allowing Batman to discover and exploit a weakness, because he's batman. For Superman, well... Superman is just unbeatable because he literally can do anything depending on the specific comic you're reading. Kyle Rayner is also literally an unstoppable God as a white lantern.

In Marvel he would likely be able to best almost every terrestrial hero, with a regenerative power beating wolverine, matter manipulation on the level of franklin richards, and the ability to continue operating without a brain (thus possibly allowing him to be resistant to psychic style attacks from Professor X or Emma Frost). I do not feel that there is an analytical mind on the level of Batman in the Marvel universe, which leaves brute force heroes. I think that only extreme beings such as Galactus, Sentry, Celestials and possibly Franklin Richards would stand a chance against Terry Crews depending on his level of matter manipulation abilities.",whowouldwin,nationalities

I hope you speak spanish or you're hiring someone to help you with that as it will be almost impossible without. Some agencies will have english speaking staff but that is rare and you can't count on it. 

Be patient and don't get too upset when they don't do their job : I went to see 2 apartments and in both cases the apartment was already sold and they didn't call to let me know, even though I had an appointment to see it myself ( had to waste about an hour to get there each time ). Sometimes they promise to get back to you and then they just don't or they give you offers that aren't what you're looking for at all. 

Long story short : there will always be a lot of apartments for sale, don't let them rush you into anything. I was rushed a bit and although I like my apartment, I would have liked to take some time to look a bit more. Good luck.",valencia,nationalities

I get asked what's my internet provider and the options are like comcast / verizon etc. I would say they are world-wide and from time to time they will target you with a test if it's requested by a company in your area ( I got a test regarding a bank from Spain ). I also got tests for people that speak only chinese / norwegian. Keep at it and be patient, it takes a while to get tests.",usertesting,nationalities

Maybe I'm picky but it seemed like it would take forever to get tasks that pay more than 0.10 cents . I live in Spain at the moment, just so you know.",beermoneyglobal,nationalities

I have used two fb groups : Expats in Valencia and Jobs in Valencia. Have a look at the CELTA course, see what others are saying about it but I think it's very useful if you want to start teaching in Spain. It helps that you speak Spanish, it will be useful while teaching and while you look for a job, schools will need more admin work done if there will be more online classes, so maybe look into that too if you're interested.",valencia,nationalities

[**Usertesting.com**](https://Usertesting.com) is paying pretty well, I managed to get in but it's not that easy to get tests, I can't seem to be in their targeted demographic very often.  The pay is 10$ / test , it can take anywhere between 10-30 min to finish a recording. 

**Mturk** was sort of slow for me, maybe I'm picky but being paid 0.01 cents / questionnaire seems low. I got around 3 $ and I sort of gave up. 

[https://lionbridgecommunity.cmnty.com](https://lionbridgecommunity.cmnty.com/authorize)  \- It's game testing , they pay around 10$ / hour . You can get maybe 2-3 sessions per month.  

Hope it helps.",beermoneyglobal,nationalities

*1. You stop having language filters, you just speak in whatever language you think nobody will understand, about anything ( and then you notice someone is looking funny at you and you realize they understood everything ). Small example : 2 cabin crew friends were talking in Romanian how good looking is the African dude seating in front of them. He thanked them and said goodbye in Romanian when leaving. 

*2. You forget that coming back to your home country EVERYONE understands you. ( Wife was complaining a little too loudly in the airport how expensive was a bottle of water, until I reminded her she needs to lower her voice )

*3. You start speaking a mix of those languages, it's a good and a bad thing at the same time, depends who you ask. Sometimes it's just easier to express something if you use terms / phrases from another language. 

Pro :
*1. You get to amuse yourself listening to people what kind of crap they talk about when they think nobody is listening. 

*2. It helps in general with work / traveling and managing to help other people who find it difficult getting themselves understood. I work at an airport where I'm among the very few that speak German, I get calls all the time to help out translate. It makes their day that someone can understand and help them.",AskReddit,nationalities
