username#01223,comment,2016-05-08 05:58,,"I've genuinely never understood the whole ""if there is alien life they would have visited us"" thing. Can someone explain to me why it's used so commonly? Humans are intelligent life that have been around for tens of thousands of years. Why haven't we visited each and every single star system in the galaxy yet if we exist? Does the fact that we haven't done this mean to other civilizations that we 100% don't exist?

Further yet, who's to say that aliens actually haven't visited us? We've only been documenting things for six thousand years or so, and only reliably documenting things for a few hundred years. Considering our planet is estimated to be 4.5 billion years old, that isn't even a fraction of a percent of our planets lifespan. They might have just visited us hundreds of millions of years ago, and we would have no clue. Not to mention, don't the laws of physics kind of prevent most civilizations from just travelling tens of thousands of light years willy-nilly? The level of advancement a civilization would need to quickly traverse to other star systems would be unimaginable. Even if there were 1,000 civilizations with this kind of technological capabilities in our galaxy, the chance of them visiting our one star system out of 100 billion in the past couple thousand years is unthinkably low.

Sorry if i've come off as ignorant, i just really don't understand that argument at all.

Im still not in a good place, and its hard to still try and find it. But I know at the very least, Im not going to leave angry in the future. As much as Im still filled with pain every day. Theres just something peaceful about accepting everything thats happened in your life, and finally not being angry at the world.

On a serious note: I cant give anything really positive to give about not committing suicide. Life is complex and its hard. Ultimately in the end its your choice. However, as much as you dont want to try antidepressants or therapy if you can afford it. Theres no harm in getting onto medication and therapy, or any harm in calling for some help. Its daunting and scary, but there are people who really care about you when you dont realize it. If there isnt, thats okay. Take it one step at a time until you cant anymore. Because theres only so much that we can take, and its okay to separate from everyone and everything. Its okay to feel lonely and trying to search for something like love if that will make you complete.

Even poor people whove been systematically shat upon love to gawk at extreme wealth and imagine they could live like that someday. They also imagine the person with the wealth must be this great person deep down, either supernaturally intelligent or hard working or both. 

I dont love this set up. And Im not horrified to imagine everyone living far more equal lifestyles, even if it means the very wealthy live far more modest lifestyles.

Being a stupid collage student. Our 3rd week with our new ID's. We decided to go to a bar tent in Utica, WI. Thinking nothing about it. We waited in line and then handed our ID's to a Dane County sheriff. He looks at them. Smiles and says...""Utica, OH and your in Utica, WI?"" Luckily, my smooth friends just says; ""Ya, we came her to visit and get wasted."" The cop just laughs and starts asking us questions on our ID's. (We all kinda panicked, but passed the test.) He finally hands us our ID's and says; ""We'll if they are fake. There damn good. Have a great night guys!""

The amount of fires (both literal and figurative) that your local governmennt puts out on a DAILY basis that folks have zero clue about would make you not sleep at night. 

Public policy is fucking HARD, and NO, it's not just ""lazy fucking politicians who are bought out by big business."" That's not how this works. Businesses ""donate"" (and I even hate that because it sounds way more sinister in theory than in practice) to people *who already agree* with them, at least most of the time. 

The idea that some giant corporation is gonna throw a bunch of cash at a candidate to get them to ""conveniently"" change their mind or a policy, is stupid, when they have far more productive ways they can get what they want. It's an exceptionally complex relationship that changes daily, depending on context, the subject matter, city politics, state governments, social media, etc.

The vast majority of people if they took a Public Policy course from a reputable school, would last five minutes with talking points before a professor shut them down.

username#00730,post,2023-06-11 17:50,The Big Reddit Blackout of 2023,"Please use this post to discuss and/or ask questions regarding the blackout that many subreddits are currently participating in. This includes anything related to why the blackout is happening. All posts about this and related topics will be redirected to this thread.

Being one of the largest communities on Reddit, we've had a ton of conversation about whether or not to keep the sub open and what our point of view is. Ultimately, we were led back to our core subreddit value of offering a neutral place to discuss topics that can be complex, challenging, and sometimes uncomfortable.

We've always done our best to be a neutral mod team because this subreddit is about letting the community discuss topics and at this moment in time, the community speaks louder than mods do. The mods here individually have our own opinions on the Reddit API controversy but as mods of a community dedicated to conversations, we think it's more impactful to keep the subreddit open so people can discuss this controversial change and the surrounding impacts.

We also want this thread to be a place of respectful discourse. Remember the human. Respect that other people can have different opinions. Please share your points of views and have open minded conversations with others. If you feel like you can't be respectful toward another user, consider not posting it.

There have been several stages to it with the project changing as each stage was ruined by internet trolls. First was a livestream outside a NYC musuem with people chanting 'He will not divide us', numerous trolls showed up on the livestream untill Shia became so annoyed that he assaulted one of them and was arrested, the museum shut the project down soon after. Shia relocated to New Mexico, a man with a gun appeared on the stream insulting trump supporters, the camera was spray painted over. The project was relocated again after gunshots were reported in the area. The third parts is the most famous one, the stream was changed from people chanting to a flag with the slogan on in an unknown location with only the sky visible. People on 4chan tracked it down to a location in Tennessee and replaced it with a Pepe t-shirt and MAGA hat. Next the flag moved to the roof of a Liverpool museum, a unknown man broke on to the museum roof but was unable to remove the flag which had been secured with cable ties, the museum cancelled the project due to security concerns. The project relaunched with the flag on a plain white wall, 4channers used the timing of sunrise to work out the region the flag could be, and confirmed it's location as the house of one of the organisers whose address was in the right area by shining a coloured light through the window. The flange was then moved to a French museum where somebody attempted to set it on fire with a drone. Finally the project moved to it's current location in Poland.",AskReddit

For example, 0 is gray. Shes shy and introverted. Her best friend is 3, shes turquoise and also an introvert. 7 is orange and hes really nice, but 49 is a jerk and everyone hates him, and hes almost the same color as 45 (a mix of yellow and pink) which is annoying cause 45 is kind and sweet and everyone likes him.

Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts dont have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback weve received, weve decided to remove these posts moving forward.

We do understand that theres some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.

For example:

* *How would you feel about a if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were, button for Reddit?* is really just a feature suggestion.
* *How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?* is a discussion question.

Our philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your How would you feel post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and well be happy to manually review.

We hope that the admins will be more forthcoming with information about the situation - we're currently as in the dark as everybody else is.

We do want to note that while we are not shutting down or removing mentions of Aimee Challenor, our normal rules **still apply and will be enforced**.  Posts or comments about the situation are allowed so long as they don't violate the rules, but using the situation as an excuse to farm karma, spew transphobic rhetoric, or doxx people will not be tolerated and will result in removals and bans, as always.  Our normal rules also apply to posts that are not asking open-ended discussion questions.  We have removed several posts today because they were not questions, or were yes/no questions.  Please read over the rules before posting so as to ensure your post follows them.

The father thanks the policeman, gives him the address, and hangs up. The policeman immediately gets into his car and drives to the address. In ten minutes, he is at the house and knocks on the door.

The father opens the door. His pants are around his ankles and his penis is standing erect. Behind him, a little girl is sobbing, bent over a chair, naked. 

The father points to a video camera in the corner of the room. ""We were in the middle of making the evidence you requested, officer. Do you want us to finish or do you want to see if we have enough?""

username#00732,comment,2021-04-27 01:33,,"Hi everyone! First, I just want to say that this blew up way more than I could have ever imagined and I want  to thank everyone for their contributions. Especially thank you to the kind people who awarded this post.

Due to the sheer volume of comments and chat messages, I can't address everything. But there are a few points I'd like to make. 

First, I am actually a graduate student who studies intergenerational relationships. In particular, looking at the context of cohousing programs (like the one I've suggested above). This question IS NOT part of my formal research but I was curious to find out what a few Redditors might think of the idea. I definitely got more than I bargained for.

Second, if you are currently interested in learning about what cohousing options are available in your area, you can Google topics such as Home Sharing, University-Based Retirement Communities, and Live-In Students at retirement centers. You might be surprised what you find.

Third, I understand that there are fundamental differences between retirement homes and nursing (or long-term care) homes. However, these differences are usually very nuanced between different countries and regions so the question hopefully remains relevant for a huge swathe of the internet. I apologize if it confused anyone or led to misinformation in the comments.

Finally, the sheer amount of attention this question got seemed to strike a chord with people. Some are firmly against the idea, either for themselves or all young people, while others are ready to sign up today. It has also drawn a lot of attention to some of the awful living conditions that some older adults are subject to in poorly managed homes. I hope that the conversations started here will move into life outside Reddit and maybe we can look forward to new ideas about generational housing models for the future. Just a thought.

Don't forget to call your grandparents, grandchildren, and everybody in between. Take care!",AskReddit

username#01010,comment,2023-10-18 01:45,,"This summer we rented a pontoon. We stopped by a small island on the lake with a very large shallow sand bar (about 2ft deep) to swim. My brother had to go back to pick up his girlfriend while my wife, kids, and I stayed to swim so I walked the boat off the sand bar where it just dropped off and told him ""ok your clear!"" So he took off. I'm a fairly strong swimmer and I litterally just walked off of it thinking I could just swim right back onto the sandbar. Well it was super windy and I realized I wasn't swimming anywhere and still couldn't touch. I started getting winded, flipped on my back, then tried again. Still no luck and the panic was setting trying to keep my mind conscious while struggling to stay afloat. Luckily there was another boat there and I started yelling for help some people came last second with a life preserver and helped pull me to safety. I thanked them profusely and when I got to the shore. The gravity of the situation set in for me and my wife and we both cried. I almost died in front of my wife and children and that's the part that got to me most. I will never underestimate the power of wind and currents again and this was just on a medium size lake. The island was fairly close to the main shore so I think the wind was pushing a current between the shore and the island. I will now always wear a life jacket when swimming in unfamiliar waters. If those other boaters weren't there I just know I wouldn't have made it.",AskReddit

I could be a wise guy and say ranked choice hurts Republicans because Republicans are thinkers And they do deviate from party lines. Many embrace libertarian ideas. The reality is that the libertarian party is much stronger than the green party and while they put out their flakes they are more likely to put out a serious candidate.

Having said that I can tell you that the Democrats in Massachusetts are dead set against rank choice voting. I really dont know how I feel about it. It is obviously something that has been used in Ireland forever.

The party in power will use every legal means to their advantage. I live in Texas and found it funny that the national media screamed about the Republicans gerrymandering. They were clever about it, they protected not only the Republican district but also the Democrats who are incumbents. In my county the Democrats gerrymandered to take away one of the county commissioners district. Over 1 million people will not to get to vote on time but will have to wait another year because theyve been put in another district. Personally, I think districts should be drawn by computer disregarding Neighborhoods, streets, and all demographics. They should look the same geometrically and have a equal population.

username#01206,comment,2021-11-04 05:18,,"Went home to visit some family only to get a text from the landlord, heard a loud bang and a Yelp. My dog was home so I naturally assumed he knocked the bookshelf on himself I sped home. I open the door to my dog COVERED in shit coming to greet me....

My dog pawed at an extension cord, brought it to the middle of the living room, bit the plug, shocked himself (hence the Yelp), and proceeded to literally shit himself. 

I had to throw the whole rug away since he was laying and rolling in it. Happened on a Sunday prior to covid so it was an awesome way to prepare for work the next day",AskReddit

username#01221,comment,2023-06-24 09:18,,"I am going through a major depressive episode.

Part of that is triggered by my environment. Like one day I order delivery fast food. I eat at my desk while enjoying some video games.

The next day I saw the bag from the evening before. I know that the kitchen and thus trash bin are 20 feet away. It is such a SIMPLE thing to just grab the bag and throw it in the bin.

But I don't. And now I don't feel like cooking anything as I don't have motivation for some reason. I just order more. And now there are two bags.

Maybe I just go get a snack, and I just add the wrapper to the take out bag, ""I will throw that away later, no big deal.""

My brain warps all of this. And then I don't even notice it as a mess anymore. Till I no longer have a desk.

I then noticed that my mess was now much larger.

My brain doesn't say, ""Just throw it out."" It's just a few trips. Instead, it says, ""No. Go to sleep. That's what you need now...

Then I start sleeping to fast forward the days, hoping that things will be better, even though I know that nothing will change if I don't do it. That doesn't matter to my mind, and my thoughts twist until sleep is the best solution.

Now I have a trigger sitting on my desk that would take almost no effort to clean up if my mind would let me, but I am now a prisoner to avoidance. I KNOW that it isn't helping, but my mind wins.

Even in my recovery phase, where I am finally allowing friends to come over and spend time... My mind is actively sabotaging.

I planned a game night for this weekend. I planned in my head that I would clean up the kitchen at least so that my shame of the mess would be hidden from them. Despite them knowing what is going on.

And on Tuesday I said: I will do It tomorrow.
And on Wednesday I said: I will do it tomorrow, and I will even do the living room cause that will make up for not doing it today.
And on Thursday I said: I am tired. I will take a nap and do it when I wake up.
And on Friday I said: I should cancel.

Thankfully, I knew my brain was going to do this as it's not new. I asked my friends to show up anyway if I tried to cancel.

So tonight, I finally had company after a month of isolation. And they helped me by cleaning up for me. Knowing that I am affected by the cleanliness of my area.

Worst part is that I know that tomorrow may be a day where I eat a late dinner and say, ""I will take that plate to the kitchen tomorrow""...

It's not rational, and I know it, but I am trapped in a warped sense of reality.

That's my version of it at least.",AskReddit

I'm simply suggesting the fairest way would be to have the voters decide on the next nominee, instead of delegates, or not?

There could be split for all we know. You may not perceive it, it could still be there, and then someone inside the party gets to decide, and not you the voter.

Why have some kind of middle man who decides on behalf of the population on who the new nominee is?

That should be up to the people is all I'm saying. The way it is set up now , if hypothetically every voter wanted someone else to run, the delegates could still say ""it's gonna be Kamala"" like how is that a democratic process?",AskReddit

So, a prophylactic measure, like a driving test to avoid car accidents. We still have car accidents, of course, and regulate traffic, but we screen beforehand too.

username#00746,comment,2020-08-10 23:42,,"One night I was watching The Conjuring at home with my little sister when we heard someone putting a key into our front door and opening it. We were sitting in the living room next to a sliding door that was very close to the front door so we both heard it very clearly. Now this didn't alarm us since we knew our dad had recently gone out to get some stuff, so we just assumed he had returned. 

Dad, youre back already? I casually asked. 

There was no response. 

Dad? I asked again, thinking that he had not heard me the first time. 

Again, silence. 

At this point I get the feeling that something isnt quite right and I could tell by the look on my sisters face that she was quite nervous as well (Ill note that up to this point she had spent the evening rolling her eyes at horror movie cliches and she very rarely gets scared). We looked at each other for a moment wondering what we should do before we started hearing a few more scattering sounds from right outside the sliding door. I was frozen in fear by this stage. 

I tried one more time in a louder, but shakier voice: Dad...is that you? 

*'Please respond, please respond...'* repeated in my head. But the silence continued. 

Now at this point Im freaking out and I literally jumped off the couch. My sister also abruptly gets up and starts rapidly walking towards the other end of the room which leads to the kitchen area (she later revealed to me that she was planning on grabbing a knife). She had this horrified look on her face that I hadnt seen before. We looked at each other in nervous silence; I didn't really know what to do and I didn't want to make any further sounds. 

I finally decided to walk up to the sliding door and began opening it as slowly as possible, peering into the darkness (I know, I literally became the idiot who investigates the unknown, creepy noise without anything to protect myself with). When the door was finally open wide enough, I poked my head out and scanned the corridor, preparing for the worst. To my surprise, there was no one there. But what was more strange was that the front door was still completely shut (we never heard the door close). My sister and I were obviously both extremely relieved as we were almost certain that there was an intruder in the house.

After this, I immediately went to go ask my mum (who was situated in her bedroom at the other end of our house) if it was her or whether she had noticed anything. She told me that she thought my dad had come home as well as she also heard someone opening the front door...

Around half an hour later, which felt like an eternity at the time as we still quite shaken from the incident, my dad finally arrived home and confirmed that he had not come home earlier. To this day my sister and I still have no idea what happened that night.",AskReddit

I was screaming stuff from the second floor calling for my little brother to get the gun (nobody was home, but for some reason I thought it was smart to pretend that I wasnt alone).

Ended up running down, opening the front door, and turning on all the lights. Nobody. Went to the kitchen and turned on all the lights, still no one. My whole house was lit up like a lighthouse, the only place left I hadnt checked was the garage. 

I went to check out the garage and saw the door was propped open.

Regarding most of the ""cherry picked"" verses in your reference, that's a different topic. If you look through my comment history you'll see how Christians typically regard those verses in Leviticus and Old Testament books. Basically, most of them , If you understood when and where they were written, were clearly written specifically for the culture and people of that time. Before crying foul, remember that homosexuality is referenced many times in the New Testament. It becomes clear that God is painting a picture for all cultures and people in regards to homosexuality, not just the people of that time. In other words, If Paul and Jesus spoke about not eating shellfish, I wouldn't be eating shellfish, because clearly that's something God wants all of his people to follow.

If you don't believe the Bible is God's word, I don't expect you to understand. And I know we come across as hypocrites and ignorant. I hope you've seen some of the good things Christians try to do for others. Jesus says ""above all else, love"" and I think if we haven't shown that, we've failed.",AskReddit

username#00919,comment,2024-03-23 16:49,,"My true story no one believes is that my college girlfriend assigned me to take her roommate on a date. 

It was annoying her that her roommate (who'd been her friend freshman year before they moved in together) had absolutely terrible boyfriends all the time. She always ended up with shitheads and my girlfriend didn't like having them around, and didn't like how they mistreated the roommate. Didn't like the drama, and thought she deserved better. So my girlfriend asked her why she picked the men she does. And long story short, the roommate had grown up in Morrocco with a highly misogynistic father and had been taught a really shitty model of men, women, and courtship. Including that she should never show any interest and that if a man was really interested, he'd violate her boundaries to aggressively pursue her. And that kind men were immature or not manly or some bullshit.

So my girlfriend came up with this crazy idea that the roommate and I were both talked into somehow, that I should take the roommate on a mock date to show her what actual kind and respectful dating is like.

So, given the rules that we were only allowed to talk flirty, compliment, and walk arm-in-arm but no more, I took my girlfriend's roommate to the mall to eat at a restaurant, window-shop, and see the Wonder Woman movie. And after we hung out chatting at a food court table and played some arcade games. 

I showed up on time. I asked her questions about her life. I complimented her outfit and her hair. I made jokes. I shared how I was feeling about my own life. I acted just like I would if I was on a real first date. We had a good time. I offered my arm and she took it as we walked. I asked for her input about things like where we wanted to walk and if it was time to move on and where to sit in the theater and etc. I got her to share her thoughts about things and listened and asked questions. At the end I told her this was fun, and I hope she has a good night.

What was very revealing afterward is that she kept saying things like ""but it wasn't really a date you were just being like a friend though right? If you were actually into me you would have [insert pushy obnoxious immature or demeaning thing here"" and I had to tell her a dozen times that no, really, that was how I would act on a first date with a woman I was actually interested in.

She was also surprised to hear that throughout the date it was unclear to me if it was going well, and that she seemed probably uninterested, and that I probably would've gone home thinking it wouldn't work out because she probably didn't like me. She didn't know she should show interest. When she went on dates she thought she was supposed to act disinterested for modesty, and an interested man would force things regardless of her feelings. 

This resulted in a second mock date in which she was assigned to act like she was interested in me. Which she actually enjoyed very much. Apparently getting to want things is fun. (though not to be too full of myself, she did say that was all an act because I'm not her type).

Her next boyfriends were progressively less shitty, kinder, and more mature. It worked.",AskReddit

A true fact can't be a secret handshake, because then more people than just the group members will agree with it.

So falsehoods become the secret handshake. Group members repeat the falsehood to signal membership and feel separate from the rest of people who don't have the ""secret knowledge"" and accepted within the group. 

So imagine your Dad actually telling you ""I joined a secret society! Want to see the secret handshake?""

It may not be a science literacy or skepticism issue. It could be that your Dad is lonely or doesn't feel special or accepted in some way he needs.

It was my third time working at that camp so all the kids knew me and I had known them pretty well. The camp was pretty much just an opened field with a couple of trailers scattered around so you could see one side of the camp from the other side. One of the only interesting parts of the camp was a totem pole made and donated by a family that i didn't get to know over my 5 years of working there. 

I decided to get some pictures of the pole before the camp start and kids started to show up, but as I was get my pictures I heard a bunch of kids call out my name telling me to come down to one of the trailers. Surprised, I waved back at them and finished taking my pictures. When I turned around all the kids were gone and the only person sitting on the front deck of the trailer was the camp director. I walked down and went into the trailer, assuming all the kids went inside. After going in I was quick to discover that there were no kids in there, it was dark and empty all the way to the back. I was quick to get out and when I left I asked the director if he saw a bunch of kids but he told me that we were the only two on camp grounds. That sent a shiver down my spine.",AskReddit

In my case, it was a situationship that ended before we could properly take the time to explore what we might be in, because we were from different faiths in a highly conservative society where the average person from each or our religions hates people from the other religion, and the two communities have a pretty bloody history filled with communal violence that continues to this day. We were more urban and sheltered from the violence, but our families remain orthodox in their conservative views on religion. 

We knew we couldn't end up together. We still got involved sexually. I fell in love with him. He chose not to, given the circumstances. 

It has been years, and not a day goes by that I don't miss him. Truth is, I would have married him in a world where it wasn't so difficult. I have been emotionally involved with people before, and in relationships that can be deemed much more serious than this, since it wasn't even a relationship. But God (yes, I see the irony of the expression in this context), I have never loved a person more and never been so sure I want to spend my life with someone. 

We live in different places now, and he maintains strict boundaries. So I don't get to speak to him, hear his voice, or see him. But not a day goes by that I don't wish I could. It haunts me every day that I cannot, and that we never got to have a proper shot together. 

The only aspect I get to have any control over is the love I feel, and that is all I have left now. I doubt I will ever stop being angry at the world for what it is.",AskReddit

The biggest one that peeves me is people dismissing safety rules for passengers like seatbelts, putting your tray table up, seat back up, electronics stowed, bags stowed. Its fairly common knowledge that these pose an evacuation hazard.

Then people howl about oh! If the plane crashes into a mountain then my seatbelt is going to save me?? The tray table is going to kill me??

Believe it or not, there are plenty of emergencies that could warrant a speedy evacuation that do not involve a nose-first impact with terrain. Landing gear collapses on landing, electrical fire in the cabin, brake fire on landing, fumes coming from avionics, etc. 

Same with seatbelts. The obvious answer at cruise is turbulence. Other stuff... rejected takeoff. At a high speed were talking jamming on the brakes like you have never experienced before. If you are unbuckled you will go sailing 10 rows in front of you.

But if we are curious about a situation that's safe to explore for real we just actually explore it in real life. Or we daydream about it but it's a pleasant daydream that feels voluntary and enjoyable.

Landing certainly takes more finesse than a takeoff but again isnt inherently dangerous.

2) Shes a high net worth socialite. She pals around with other high net worth and powerful corporate types. Check the Wikipedia page. 

3) Our federal justice system is already bad at holding the rich and powerful accountable. THIS DOJ is probably worse than all priors at it. 

4) She likely has information damaging to those in power right now, both American and British, and who knows who else. 

5) She appears to be easily influenced by money and prestige, so Im guessing thats the tool that makes her go away forever. 

In Conclusion: It will be an abnormal criminal proceeding with an abnormal result. I dont think she gets suicided, as some suspect. I think thats a bad look for those in power, and probably unnecessary when she can just be bought off. 

Instead, I think the case is either tossed due to legal shenanigans or shes given a minor but symbolic chastisement so we can say were tough on crime and actually care about the evils of pedophilic human trafficking. 

So, consequences, but, you know, not like poor black man consequences. Thats absurd.",AskReddit

What is acceptable by today's society is OK. As Christians, we have a single point of reference in regards to morality. I can tell you if any particular thing is right or wrong, at any time, not by what society says, but by what the Bible says. Not by how I feel, or what's popular, or what's in the movies that year.

People haven't changed much. We all, throughout time, have been driven by pleasures and desires, love and happiness. But we both agree what has become acceptable in society HAS changed. You're absolutely right that there's some very obvious examples for the better, in regards to civil rights. That's something to celebrate. But that doesn't mean mean where we've ended up is good. Nearly every aspect of our lives now is drowning in greed, pleasure, and laziness.

""If you realize that progress can and should occur, then you'll also realize the Bible has a lot less authority than many think"" - That wouldn't make sense for a Christian to think that way. The Bible IS the authority. You make the claim that humans have made progress in morality - but you have nothing on which to base that statement. How do you conclude that what anyone or any time period is doing is ""right"" or ""wrong"" and is the ""authority"" on how we should all act? What if I told you 50 years from now no one ate meat and saw it as an abomination? Does that mean the meat eaters of today are ""wrong"" for eating meat?

""in ancient Hebrew society, clearly genocide of conquered peoples was condoned. That, certainly, is not moral."" Again, what basis do you have to suddenly say something done in the Bible is immoral? And why do you think I would ever see that as immoral if I truly believe the creator of the universe condoned that action?

So anyway, I certainly don't believe that humans are creating a better template of morality as time goes on. I don't see how someone could make that conclusion when they have no point of reference for morality to begin with.",AskReddit

My parents did neither of those. I was neither spoiled nor taught anything.

Actually my mother has the emotional maturity of a 14-year-old and once my dad left she basically promoted me to substitute ""adult"" of the house. I was 12. But she was coming to me for advice and emotional regulation. She'd dump her problems on me.

As a 12-year-old boy I'd had three kids. My brother my sister and my mom. 

You'd think that'd make me grow up quick right? Well no. Because I was 12 and had no models of growing up. It made me lock in models of how to respond to things. But the ways my 12-year-old brain came up with while desperate and terrified.

So now I have all these triggers that make me feel like I have to respond to things the way my traumatized scared 12-year-old self thought was the best way, or else I'll die.

username#01230,comment,2014-02-13 09:48,,"My uncle who is a farmer posted this link on facebook and I was curious as.to if its true or not. Comtents of link: I have to admit, I melt at the creaminess of full-fat yogurt. It's an indulgence that we're told to resist. And I try to abide. (Stealing a bite of my daughter's YoBaby doesn't count, does it?) The reason we're told to limit dairy fat seems pretty straight forward. The extra calories packed into the fat is bad for our waistlines. That's the assumption. But what if dairy fat isn't the dietary demon we've been led to believe? New research suggests we may want to look anew. Consider the findings of two recent studies that conclude the consumption of whole fat dairy is linked to reduced body fat. In one paper, published by Swedish researchers in the Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care, middle-aged men who consumed high-fat milk, butter and cream were significantly less likely to become obese over a period of 12 years compared to men who never or rarely ate high-fat dairy. Yep, that's right. The butter and whole-milk eaters did better at keeping the pounds off. ""I would say it's counter-intuitive,"" says Greg Miller, executive vice president of the National Dairy Council. The second study, published in the European Journal of Nutrition, is a meta-analysis of 16 observational studies. There has been a hypothesis that high-fat dairy foods contribute to obesity and heart disease risk, but the reviewers concluded that the evidence does not support this hypothesis. In fact, the reviewers found that in most of the studies, high-fat dairy was associated with a lower risk of obesity. ""We continue to see more and more data coming out [finding that] consumption of whole-milk dairy products is associated with reduced body fat,"" Miller says. It's not clear what might explain this phenomenon. Lots of folks point to the satiety factor. The higher levels of fat in whole milk products may make us feel fuller, faster. And as a result, the thinking goes, we may end up eating less. Or the explanation could be more complex. ""There may be bio-active substances in the milk fat that may be altering our metabolism in a way that helps us utilize the fat and burn it for energy, rather than storing it in our bodies,"" Miller says. Whatever the mechanism, this association between higher dairy fat and lower body weight appears to hold up in children, too.As we reported last year, a study of children published in the Archives Of Diseases in Childhood, a sister publication of the British Medical Journal, concluded that low-fat milk was associated with more weight gain over time. ""It really surprised us,"" study author Mark DeBoer, a pediatrician at the University of Virginia, told us. So, where does this leave us, the rule-followers, who have complied with the skim-milk-is-best edict? Well, opinions differ. The recommendations that led to the fat-free dairy boom were, in part, born out of concerns about cholesterol. Whole-milk dairy products are relatively high in saturated fat. And eating too much saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease. So many experts would agree that adults with high cholesterol should continue to limit dairy fat. But it's also becoming clear that there are benefits to full-fat dairy too, at least for some consumers. As we've reported, in addition to the body weight association, organic whole milk contains beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. It's unclear whether more people are opting for whole milk products. Though non-fat and low-fat are still dominating dairy sales, the organic sector is experiencing an uptick in whole-fat sales. ""We definitely in the last few years are seeing a trend toward the whole fat products,"" George Siemon, CEO of the farmer-owned Organic Valley, told us. His company's sales of whole-fat milk are up 10 percent, he says. And sales of skim milk have trailed off. Also, there's been a boom in butter sales. So, stay tuned. Though it's a sounds-too-good-to-be-true finding, researchers are continuing to investigate how dairy fat may help people control their weight.

username#00989,comment,2020-03-22 03:11,,"Lemme see if I can break it down a little clearer, I was trying to keep things short.

This happened in a jurisdiction handled by the city police, and I got a call from the county sheriff who would never handle whatever the misdemeanor/felony is for shooting a gun in public.  They asked me if they could show me some photos and pick this kid out of the photos.  So the timeline of events that became clear on Monday was:

* Kid shoots at me and my sister.  Sister tries to give police the name of the kid he was with, his phone number, name of the taxi service they called.  The officer wanted none of that information.
* After shooting they go back to Dave's house via the taxi cab.
* Kid says he would like to borrow a beer keg tap for a party he's going to from Dave.  Kid follows Dave into his basement to retrieve the tap, and executes his ""best friend"".  I believe it was because Dave knew my sister and he had exchanged info with her and he knew if the cops came Dave would have to turn him in.
* After killing Dave, the Kid goes upstairs to Dave's roommates room and says, ""Give me the keys to your car.""  Roommate says ""Fuck off, I'm sleeping""  Kid says ""Say goodbye to your face"" and shoots him in the neck.  I am not making up these cheesy wannabe gangster lines, this is from the roommates testimony at the trial.
* Kid rummages through the roommates things, find the keys, takes the car back up to the Indian Reservation where he lives, parks the car in the woods, sets it on fire, then goes to the party he was planning on going to, the one where he needed a keg tap for.
* Off duty cop is walking her dog, sees smoke in the woods, checks the vehicle to make sure nobody is in there, calls in the VIN to her station.
* Kid gets into a fight at this party and is arrested by the Indian police and is in their jail.
* Police call the sister of the roommates owner since they couldn't get him on the phone.  She goes over to his house, finds him in his bed in a pool of blood and he's still alive 18 hours after being shot in the neck and being a paralyzed from the shoulders down.
* The reason it was a small world incident was because the girl I was dating couldn't get home that night because her street was blocked off by the sheriffs who were at the murder scene.  She lived less than a block away from him.

To wrap it all up, the kid was convicted on murder 1, and attempted murder, and I believe he is in the same jail as Steven Avery, or at least he was when I checked a couple of years ago.",AskReddit

Ive been watching my mental psyche as of late cause I just got betrayed and backstabbed by a close friend thats helped ground me down. Turns out all he does is talk shit about my depression and the state of my life when Im not around. Me and other folks have been thinking and realized that he was just there to make himself feel better about himself and be on this pedestal. Im glad I cut him out of my life though because I couldnt handle his mental manipulation towards his girlfriend any longer. Telling her shit like You have to choose between me or your parents because Im going to leave if you dont. Then claiming that theyre in love. 

Im expecting to admit myself to the ER with a 5150 within the next month or so, depending if I can continue to handle the stress in my life or not. Dunno if Ill be around next year, and just the thought of continuing for another year just makes me depressed even more. Ive found solace and acceptance in suicide so I still have that planned out down the road. Life is rough when you have no family and a trustworthy friends anymore.

On a positive note. Spending time away from people does help with finding myself still, but it still adds to the now new existing trust issues, and social anxiety that is now 10 fold. Yay to snakes in the grass and fucked up friendships that affect you real bad. /s",AskReddit

Here are some of her quotes.

""If you ask a parent of an autistic child if they want the measles or the autism, we will stand in line for the fucking measles.""

""The reason why [parents] are not vaccinating is because the vaccines are not safe. Make a better product and then parents will vaccinate.""

""I do believe sadly its going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe.""

""Time magazine's article on the autism debate reports that the experts are certain 'vaccines don't cause autism; they don't injure children; they are the pillar of modern public health.' I say, 'that's a lie and we're sick of it.'""

""Yes, a wave of 12 children with measles in San Diego is a troubling thing. But, there are more than 20,000 children in San Diego with autism! 20,000 vs. 12?""

""Almost all kids get  injected toxins  very early in life, and our own government clearly acknowledges vaccines cause brain damage in certain vulnerable kids.""

""What number does it have to be for everyone to start listening to what the mothers of children who have autism have been saying for years, which is ... We vaccinated our baby and SOMETHING happened. SOMETHING happened. Why won't anyone believe us?""

""If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it's their fucking fault that the diseases are coming back. They're making a product that's shit. If you give us a safe vaccine, we'll use it. It shouldn't be polio versus autism.""

""Moms and pregnant women are coming up to me on the street going, 'I don't know what to do'... And I don't know what to tell them, because I am surely not going to tell anyone to vaccinate. But if I had another child, there's no way in hell.""",AskReddit

username#01222,comment,2014-02-23 22:34,,"As far as gay marriage goes, it can be very difficult to be on the other side without looking like you're full of hate. I'll try my best to explain it from a Christian perspective.

For starters, ALL of my fellow Christians believe you should treat EVERYONE with the same amount of love and respect, because in the end we've all sinned and fall short of God.

It may seem hypocritical, then, when we speak out against gay marriage. In fact there's nothing wrong with two men loving each other, but the actual act of having sex with another man is considered a sin, and amoral, in the Bible. We also believe that continued acceptance of amoral acts in our society has put our civilization into a decline. One can see these effects in our society pretty clearly: dress and actions that would be considered shocking 50 years ago are considered normal. Children are having sex at younger ages. People are becoming more proud, overweight, and self-entitled. Our government is falling apart at the seams, tainted by corruption, ineptitude, and greed. Our freedoms and privacy become more limited day after day.

So for (most) of us, it's not a hate or limits on self-expression issue, it's a common good issue. Please make sure you understand that I don't think homosexuals are destroying America - rather it's our continued embrace of (what we consider to be) immorality and the idea that ""if it feels good, do it."" The acceptance of homosexuality, not homosexuality in and of itself, is what we care about.

You don't necessarily need to be a Christian to accept my argument. In the book Sex and Culture, for instance, an Oxford anthropologist (not a Christian) found a direct link between the decline of a civilization and their limits on sexual expression ([ That said, I'm absolutely not surprised that if you think the Bible is a bunch of crap, then this argument is a bunch of crap as well. However I hope that, at least, you can understand why some people who profess to be full of love would be so against two people in love from getting married.

Those out there with signs saying ""God hates fags"" are full of hate and do not represent us. I feel great pain and remorse for all of the homosexuals who have been ill treated and shunned by Christians or anyone else.

**Account Requirements**

In order to apply, your account must meet the following criteria:

* Your account must have at least 5,000 combined (post+comment) karma. This excludes awarder/awardee karma. Begging for karma to meet this requirement may result in a ban or disqualification from consideration.
* Your account must be at least 1 year old.

**These are firm requirements**, and you will not be able to apply unless you meet all three of them. Everyone that meets these requirements is welcome to apply, and note that we do not make exceptions to them. 

The link to the application can be found [here]( Most of the responses are limited to 500 characters, so please keep your responses complete and concise. Each question contains a counter that will tell you how many characters you have left.

The application is composed of two parts: a questionnaire and a multiple-choice rules quiz (we give you 10 posts and ask you to determine if they break the rules or not). Although both parts factor into our decision, please dont stress too much about the quiz. We dont expect you to have a perfect understanding of the rules right now, but this does give us a sense of where you are with the community rules.

In the book: The book ends with a dying Neville realizing that, to the vampires, he is the bogeyman, the stuff of nightmares, as vampires themselves were once to humans. He will become a legend, not because he's a great man, but because in his extinction he will be a cautionary tale and a mythical figure to a newly formed society.

In the movie: The movie had an alternate ending as well as the one which was theatrically released. In the theatrical release, Will Smith's character, Robert Neville dies along with the Darkseekers while trying to protect the cure for the widespread virus.

Why?: Revealed by I Am Legend director Francis Lawrence, the reason the ending was changed to the happier one seen in theaters is due to intensely negative reactions to the ending where Neville has his villainous realization from test audiences.",AskReddit

Could that be true? In my mind its possible. We know (through a widely accepted theory) that the universe started from the Big Bang. If our laws of physics propose that there is an action and a reaction, then what was before the Big Bang? Some theories say we are in an endless cycle of Big Bangs where we explode into reality and back into a singularity, and then back again.

username#01144,comment,2020-12-02 06:39,,"So at my school as juniors we had to work a number of concession shifts and work on a prom/ homecoming committee in order to be allowed to go to prom. I wasn't really interested in going to prom in the first place so at the beginning of the year I told my two friends I didn't really want to go and do all that stuff anyway. They convinced me to go and said that we could go to dress shopping together. So I relented.

Fast forward to February of that school year I finished all the work I needed to do and mentioned to my friends that we should figure out a time to go dress shopping. 

They had already gone without me. 

Then once prom was approaching I asked what we should do for dinner and getting ready and all that jazz.

They already made plans because they thought that I was going with a different group. They were my two best friends.",AskReddit

Bathroom orgy. (Don't ask.)

Someone set off a stink bomb. (Last day prank.)

Someone threw around water balloons filled with bleach. (Also a last day prank.)

Someone got their nudes leaked to the whole school. (Literally overnight)

Some kid got caught getting ""action"" from two girls in the band hall. (Not the smartest idea.)

School shooting threat. (Ah, but that's normal in the US)

Players destroying the locker room. (They lost every game this season)

Some dude got taken out of class for having vodka in a water bottle. 

Someone threw baby powder/flour around at our home coming game. A TON of it, enough to choke everyone up.

Old theater arts teacher got fired for groping a girl and telling her ""how sexy she is"". (What the fuck.)

Dude smashed a window out of frustration of getting underclassmen pregnant. 

Someone burst into another class and started beating the shit out of another guy for touching his sister. (I don't blame him)

Announcer for another school used racial slurs against our school at football game. (Also called a cheerleader fat.)

School dances nearly cut because condoms kept getting found in the bathroom.

Big fight that ending up with a gun being pulled. (That gun was passed through five people btw)

Apparently, a girl in some other class was called a slave by a substitute teacher.

username#00745,comment,2023-09-11 04:24,,"If its PTSD then its gonna still be there. PTSD is not simply a psychological condition its whats referred to as a psychosomatic condition which means it has a physical presence in the nervous system (the body) which was created alongside the traumatic memory in the brain.

If time has passed, but there still hasnt been any effective treatment then its still going to be there in the body. One of the biggest misconceptions of PTSD is that any amount of time or psychological thinking is ever going to do anything about it on its own.

Remember that a trauma is a trauma when something which happens is too much for the mind to be able to process and so it stays stored unprocessed in both the body and the mind. If its still coming back 27 years later then its real, end of discussion.

For treatment I recommend researching somatic/emdr therapists, somatic massages, and mdma assisted trauma therapy. All are very different approaches but have significant medical evidence that they are extremely effective. For personal research I recommend learning as much as possible about poly-vegal theory as it is the foundation of understanding what has happened to you and why. The body keeps the score is an excellent book for laying out what this condition actually is.

As far as dealing with the government thats a whole other thing that I know very little about, I wish I had more to offer there, but I can tell you that no amount of time changes the legitimacy of the condition with PTSD in the eyes of someone who studies it.

Youre not crazy, and its not your fault that this is still going on. As someone whos been there before (non-military) my heart goes out to you. It is curable and I believe in you!

You just cannot show someone it who doesn't have laser goggles on of the maximum rating.
If you hit yourself for less that a millisecond your retina will be completely destroyed rendering you blind forever.

I'm not saying you would never do this it's just you have to be EXTREAMLY responsible and careful and you will have to have extensive knowledge on the subject.

Like I know how this works on the quantum level and only now was I able to make it.

I suggest you try something less dangerous, and safe stuff can be extremely cool for example before I made this kind of stuff I did small robots with Arduino that still really wowed everyone.

username#00854,post,2019-09-07 00:56,MY JOB IS SUCH BULLSHIT!!!,"I'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is kinda cute, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. I'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. This guy is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I'm pretty sure after work. He probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",teenagers

username#00854,comment,2019-10-14 09:08,,"I see things about a strange army somewhere in China

Tons and tons of men with no two the same face

It is of the army of the emperor from long ago

It all looks so interesting and impossible on how much was even built

This whole group of individuals without souls based off of individuals with souls should be a wonder of the world

But it can be the wonder of other people's worlds

I have seen it on a picture but have not been to China to see them in real life

But that is okay because at least I know what it looks like

It still gets in my head how this goal was even reached

I can just imagine getting a lot of clay just to make a terracotta warrior myself

And let it guard my home like it was a decoration

But if it gets stolen or robbed by some fools, it won't stop me from making another one

I don't even have the type of money to buy a real terracotta warrior for myself

Numbers in the thousands, a number I can take steps for to even get to China

So there I am beginning my work, making the terracotta warrior

I start from the feet because starting from the head would not be easy

And it sure is the laws of gravity to blame

I take my time from playing ball at the grass to focus on this warrior

By the time I'm done, I'm gonna name it Terry

At least it's unoriginal rather than weirdly giving it a specific name for a simple statue

I build the face out of my imagination of what a terracotta warrior would look like

And by the time three days had passed, it has finally been completed

My terracotta warrior is complete and good as new

But I wouldn't carry around something that heavy on my back just to show it to my friends

I put it out my house, hoping it doesn't get stolen to take another three days

I see someone passing by and they stop, I see them from the window and cross my fingers

They give the warrior a fist bump and continue their walk, but at least the terracotta warrior survived another day

And just like that, everyone wants to know how I did it

They want to know how long I took and why I did it in the first place

I just say that it was interesting to me, I liked how well done the whole thing turned out

Terry still survives to this day and even got kind decorations from the people

Like glasses, paint, hats, and other things to show the people's appreciation

Terry brought people together, and he didn't even have to move or be real",teenagers

So I really liked this girl and I finally got the courage to ask her out. She said yes so I told one of my best friends. So even he started talking to her just like that and guess what he started liking her.

So what that asshole did is stated telling her that I wanted to break up cause she was taking to much of my time but I was so happy with her.

So she broke up with me. At first I didn't understand wat happened so I made a fake account to talk to get as a friend and she said how much she hated me because of what my best friend told her.

I was so fucking losers and angry I confronted my friend and he and I aren't friend anymore.

But she still hates me so much and I liked her soo much and I was so happy

According to the lore of Monsters Inc, screams generate energy but laughs generate more. Going by that logic, the amount of energy produced by a human is proportional to the amount of happiness they express in the noises they make. Therefore, moans of extreme sexual pleasure must have the highest energy density of any noise a human can make. If the management of Monsters Inc want to maximize their energy output they should send workers to large, organized orgies and train them in the ways of intense lovemaking. They should identify large furry gatherings as potential sources of nuclear meltdown levels of energy generation.",teenagers

My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.",teenagers

From what little we know about pre-history, we're fairly certain humans lived in tribes, hunted large land animals, and used spears and other weapons.

It doesn't matter if a baby is making noise in the human camp. A bear or tiger will not approach a group of 50-100 people to investigate a noise. And if it did, a group of spear hunters who feed themselves by killing bison, zebra, boars, and other large animals regularly can actually reliably fend off a bear or a lion. Not only by the spears, but also early humans would carry satchels of stones and a sling for flinging the stones at targets with surprising speed and accuracy. The predator would be pelted with stones as soon as it got too close for comfort.

But what about a baby that has wandered away from the group? Predators can already find the lost baby by smell. Babies stink. Staying quiet won't make it more safe. And if it's quiet, it could be very hard to find. A lost baby's only hope is to be quickly found. So lost babies wail.",NoStupidQuestions

Now, Im going to make the assumption that Michelle loves both of you dearly, and vice versa. Talk to an open minded lawyer. They can talk to you about getting some legal things to have Michelle be the beneficiary on SOME things, either through trusts, life insurance, power of attorney etc. its a legal minefield, but if you are serious, its most definitely worth it. However, keep in mind, pretty much every jurisdiction is gonna rank your wife in higher priority than your GF, unless its explicitly spelled out (and even then Im sure the spouse can wiggle out of it) 

However, I cannot emphasize this enough, do not do ANYTHING unless you three are absolutely on the same page. Like, I would literally write down an entire list of issues, both legal and personal, and you three sit down and talk about it. Bluntly. Honestly. And without shame.

The protest mentality is strong on college campuses and there are always people registering voters at colleges.

There's a bunch of people who treat this with blase old jackass responses like ""of course young people don't vote, they're too busy on tik-tok watching people eating cat turds to vote"", but I don't recall ever seeing any actual news on the topic.

Yes, there are obviously young people who don't give a shit about politics, and are otherwise apathetic, but I also know people who were unable to vote because they were traveling, or didn't have transportation/didnt receive mail ballots, or prioritized life/work over voting when forced to decide how to spend their time.

Meanwhile old people are among the strongest groups of voters, and people like my dad who didn't give a shit about voting began after he retired, so he was a non-voter when he was young and then became a voter. 

I'm more interested in the young people thing, though. Every year, some group of people says ""we would have won if people under thirty had turned out!"" and I just question why it happens every single year.",NoStupidQuestions

Aside from the 2nd, there arent any, if at all. If you mean unique as in we have more leeway or less restrictions than most if not all developed nations, there are a few. 

1) You can name your child whatever you want. Iceland, Germany, and Japan, they restrict you from naming your kids outlandish things like Optimus Prime, Adolf, etc. California and some other states have *some* restrictions, kind of, but theyre so easy to avoid its virtually impossible to hit those unless you were deliberately trolling (I.e Elon Musk). 

2) Freedom of Religion is almost absolute. In the military, as an example, you can believe literally whatever you want so long as it doesnt interfere with your duties. Try being a fully practicing Muslim in France and see how well it ends for you. 

3)Aside from some very specific instances, freedom of speech is more protected here than in other western nations. 

4) Double Jeopardy is also not as universal as you might think. A lot of Europeans have loopholes around their DJ laws if the prosecutor has a vendetta. Are they difficult to go through? Yes.

username#00985,post,2024-02-28 01:07,Is it possible to block content across the majority of the internet regarding a specific individual? Beyond social media.,"I have an acquaintance who has had some very traumatic experiences when younger with a specific individual that was briefly in their life. They didnt live close to each other and they of course blocked their account on Facebook so theres been relative success in moving forward without panic rushing back.

There have been attempts at therapy previously and obviously, more would always be better.

However, my acquaintance recently went into their Facebook Blocked Accounts list and were suddenly hit with a massive way of panic and concern upon seeing the perpetrator of their traumas name. Unfortunately, curiosity got the better of them and a Google search brought back even worse memories.

They are doing alright now but I am very curious if anyone is aware of ways to block content across the majority of the internet centering around a specific individuals name?

This stretches beyond social media because this individual has managed to become a public figure within a community that my acquaintance identifies into... They also now live several States closer to where my friend lives. Thus, making it a bit more likely that the perpetrators name or face may appear from time to time and trigger traumatic memories.

username#00729,comment,2020-07-05 13:15,,"I dont know if there is a specific name for this technique in an argument. 

Rhetorically, this sounds like an invitation to supply an argument via inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning takes a specific representative case or facts and then draws generalizations or conclusions from them. 

So, in your example, the person challenging you to come up with examples is suggesting your conclusion is unsupported by a sufficient amount of reliable evidence. In other words, your inductive reasoning is faulty because you cant back it up with specifics. 

One counter to this is to show that your conclusion is deductive (deriving from a generalization to a specific case). So, from your example, you could say I dont have to give you examples about how you dont care about me. I know you dont care about me because you dont care about anyone (or anyone like me, or pick your generalization).",NoStupidQuestions

In recent years, Twitch and YouTube have begun to seriously crackdown on copyrighted music being played on peoples streams, and have begun punishing Streamers who do it. From what I understand, this is because Twitch themselves become liable for the copyrighted music under DMCA. So my question is this: Are Cam-Girl websites moderated in the same way?

Whenever you see an advert for one of the sites (we're all adults here guys, cmon now) there seems to be music playing, and a small browse of one of these websites show hundreds of streams playing music. Are these streamers getting copyright strikes against their streams? Is THAT website in breach of the law? If not, why not?

But my friends decided to get ice cream. I distinctly remember panicking that I had nothing on me to buy it with. But our local bank had a branch right on that street corner. So while my friends were dawdling I walked in and filled out a withdrawal slip and brought it up to the teller. They looked at the slip, typed some things in the computer, looked at my face, then handed me the cash.

That's my memory of it, anyway. I brought up this memory while a current friend was complaining about bureaucracy at their bank, and they didn't believe it. Said I must be misremembering it. That banks have always required a card or ID for withdrawals. Did I making up a false memory? Could that have actually happened?

username#00864,post,2023-09-05 20:04,Is it possible to get into a decent enough college with a 2.5 GPA?,"So im currently a senior in High school, and I found out my GPA is about a 2.5 (2.48 to be exact). And this is totally bumming me out. 
I failed my freshman year in 2020 due to not doing well with online schooling and undiagnosed ADHD, coming out only passing English. But ever since then I've done really well in school. I usually average at Cs, Bs, and some As in stuff like science and history. I even ended up going to Boys State (which is a really big academic flex in a lot of places), and doing a few other really big things to help my school and community. But even with the effort I've put in the last 2-3 years, my GPA is still way below average. I've been planning on going to college for mechanical engineering for the last few years, but looking at my current GPA it's not looking feasible. 
Is there any way I can get a better chance at getting into a good enough college without them immediately disqualifying me due to my Grade Point Average, or am I screwed?
Sadly I don't play any sports, so that's out of the question. And I'm currently studying for my SAT in October.

Sorry if this question doesn't fit in this sub. I'm just really worried for my academic future, and I don't know what to do.

username#00919,comment,2024-03-24 16:16,,"So the usual reason bad actors want to take someone's passport is so that even if the person escapes their immediate custody, they can't get out of the country because they can't cross international borders or board international flights without a passport. So they're at least fenced in by the county's borders.

For example Saudi Arabians will take their Indonesian servant's (slave's) passport so they can't flee back to Indonesia. They can't board an international flight or cross a land border crossing without a passport, so even if they run away from the household they won't be able to leave Saudi Arabia and so will likely be re-captured.

In North Korea this might be unnecessary? But I don't know. I doubt you could board an international flight out of North Korea without the government's blessing even if you had your passport.

The southern border with South Korea is heavily patrolled and guarded, so it'd be dangerous and almost impossible to cross it without permission from North Korean military. But if one did sneak across it, the South Koreans would give asylum and wouldn't turn you away just for not having your passport with you. They're very welcoming towards anyone fleeing North Korea in any condition. They're used to North Koreans fleeing/defecting. But I'm sure they'd give asylum to a foreign tourist and figure out how to get you back home. As far as I know you could approach a South Korean border checkpoint naked, crying, and covered in blood and feces and the South Koreans would welcome you in and give you a towel and a cup of tea while they warm up the shower for you and say ""We're just happy you made it out alive.""

I have no idea what would happen if someone who visibly appeared to be a tourist but had no passport tried to flee North Korea via the land border with China. Best case the Chinese officials take them in and contact the tourist's home country's embassy to get them a replacement passport and an entry visa so they can book a flight home through an airport in China. Medium case they arrest them and jail them in China. Worst case the border guards turn them away and give them back to the North Koreans.

Edit: I researched this a little. Most tours to North Korea start with a rendezvous in China. Then fly from China to North Korea, or drive across the border. This means the Chinese government will have issued an entry visa allowing the tourists into China. This helps. Because if you identify yourself at the border, they can at least look you up and find the entry visa they issued for you. And it means you're legally allowed to enter China, you're just missing your documents. Better than having no documents, no record anywhere of who you are, and no permission to enter. 

I now think if a tourist fled North Korea via the land border with China, they'd probably get out. Though they'd get held at the Chinese border checkpoint talking to angry officials and calling their embassy for many hours. And once they got into China the government wouldn't be happy with them. They'd probably get a lot of angry questioning and then deported home, banned from re-entering China for awhile.",pics

You just did it again! You know very well I don't believe the tree gave them the knowledge of right and wrong. You're the one equating the two and so you're the one that's going in circles! Do you understand my argument that the knowledge the tree gave them is very different than the knowledge from right and wrong? I'm not sure you are...

""The reality is two grown adults with adult minds with no concept of evil, were suppose to know disobeying the creator of the universe was evil. You keep avoiding this fact and never address it.""

I'm not avoiding it, it just doesn't make sense. What does knowing that disobeying God is evil have ANYTHING to do with knowing right from wrong? Why do you think I believe they're the same? I've said many times that you don't need to understand evil/sin to know right from wrong, therefore you don't get a free pass from the creator of the universe. 

""We aren't getting anywhere because you're holding people accountable for knowing good from evil when they did not have knowledge of good and evil.""

No like I've stated many many times, I'm holding people accountable for knowing the **difference between right and wrong** when they did not have the knowledge of good and evil.

I'm not sure it makes sense to continue the discussion because you're not quite understanding what I'm saying. Please do visit that link I gave though, it really doesn't do a good job of explaining things.

username#01222,comment,2014-08-28 02:06,,"The short answer is that in order for there to be free will, God couldn't stop Adam and Eve from ever being tempted.  And Adam and Eve were not innocent here, they were intelligent adults that knew what they were doing was wrong. 

So God allows Satan to exist in order for man to be given a choice between Him and sin. But honestly I can't tell you why God would give us free will given that he knew we would choose the wrong thing. Perhaps it's because the love between two people is only truly real if it's by choice. Like, if your wife was forced to love you. It wouldn't seem right.  Since we are supposedly made in His image, he might have felt the same way about us.

Also keep in mind, if God truly is real, I can't imagine we could deduce the exact reasoning behind our existence. His thinking must be on a plane far above ours. That's where faith comes in. Where we have to say ""This may not make perfect sense, but I'm going to believe it's true."" Sometimes it's the only way out if you want to believe in the supernatural.

username#00839,comment,2020-10-04 23:56,,"I went out with my telescope last night to check out the moon and planets. Jupiter and Mars were difficult to see because of all the smoke lately, but the Moon looked great! It was barely coming back from a full moon, which makes some of its craters look really nice due to the contrast in its shadows. 

I captured this image by taking a video, then using another software to stack the individual frames (which reduces noise) and sharpened the image in another program before tweaking the exposure and contrast a bit. The whole process seems complicated, but its actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it!

My equipment:

Celestron Celestar 8 Deluxe (telescope)

iPhone 11 (camera)

If someone feels like they are being attacked or insulted then emotion will usually override logic. When that happens you have no real chance of persuading them to change their view point, and at the end of the day you have only hurt the cause that you were trying to defend. 

The language with which you choose to convey an argument is often more important than the merit of the argument itself. Just look at the careful manipulation of language in advertising and politics. Derisive rhetoric is great when you're speaking to those who already agree with you, but it's counterproductive when trying to win new supporters.",pics

I ran this through a stabilization/file conversion program, then put it into the stacking software and tweaked the settings until it produced a final image that looked decent.

I want to emphasize that anybody can do this. All I did for this picture was mount my phone onto the eyepiece and start recording. I feel like a lot of people see this hobby as an advanced only thing, but while it does have a steep learning curve, you can start at ANY time from ANY place with literally 0 experience. All it takes to look at planets is a telescope, and all you need to take pictures is your phone (just dont expect any Cassini-esque photos of Saturn!)

Anyway, all of that to say that if youre considering pursuing astronomy or astrophotography as a hobby, I highly recommend it as it is a fun and incredibly rewarding pastime that you can share with friends and family.

I used to use an alternative Discord account and lurk the discord of a high profile TF2 cheater.  I did so largely so I could keep track of what was the current state of TF2 cheats.  Spoiler alert: The people who pay to cheat in TF2 are at least as toxic amongst themselves as they are toward legit players.  

Why do I bring this up?  The cheater's discord had a rule34 bot.  Users typed !rule34 [thing] and the bot would do its best to spam whatever related R34 images it could find.  It was in this discord that not only is Flo from Progressive a very popular R34 subject, but that there is a staggering amount of content involving her.

Neither struggle is more worthy or more important/valid than the other, but I think recognizing the unique experiences of each group is important.

I get all the seasonal allergies regularly but for some reason my period kicks them into high gear. I got my period last night and the biggest clue was that I had been nearly incapacitated at work that day. When this happens I can't stop sneezing; my eyes get super red, puffy, and itchy; I get incredibly congested. And when I take any kind of medicine it doesn't work. When it gets that bad my only option is to put a damp cloth over my eyes and nose and fall asleep. But I was at work, in retail, and the store is so small we only have one person working on weekdays. I couldn't get anyone to cover so I spent roughly my whole 6-hour shift in a state of constant sneeze. And it's a bread store, and I was working the closing shift, so I kept aggravating my symptoms by either slicing bread or sweeping up crumbs.

My period allergies can go fuck themselves.",AskWomen

username#01087,comment,2019-11-06 01:13,,"For me its two things that are tied pretty closely together - stress management/coping skills and temperament. 

Stress management and coping skills are generally pretty important because there are truly just some ways of approaching stressful situations that are incompatible with someone elses way of approaching the same thing (lets say youre both big panicky people, its pretty likely that youre just going to end up making each others stress worse). 

The other big one for me, temperament, is pretty critical. I dated someone for YEARS that had, to this day, one of the hottest and most explosive tempers Ive ever been around. Hed punch walls, and clench his fists, and just be so absolutely aggrieved by whatever it was that upset him that he was impossible to talk to for probably a half hour. Call that what you will, but it became a pretty manipulative thing in our relationship, whether it was intentional or not. Nothing makes me more anxious than conflict, so pretty quickly I just learned to bite my tongue to avoid an ensuing fight/blowup. 

Now, at the first sight of a temper like that I cut bait. I know that its not good for me and that no matter how much I care for the person, Im never going to really be compatible, or feel safe with someone like that. It also has made me more keenly aware of what things people do in times of tension and stress that DO work for me (i.e. coping skills)",AskWomen

The therapist I started seeing post-breakup asked me to start journaling about the biggest fights my boyfriend and I had gotten into, how I felt during/after those fights, and what stopped me from leaving after every one of them. 

I honestly like to think of myself as pretty emotionally self-aware (I also have a masters in social work), but when I say it literally did not click until I did this activity, I mean it. I started noticing some flags when I was writing, but when I talked to my therapist about one of the bigger fights wed gotten into she asked me something along the lines of are you familiar with what compensatory behavior is? and I was just like OH, FUCK. I DO KNOW AND THIS MAKES SO MUCH SENSE NOW.

Its easy to get lost in the moment and what feels normal in your relationship - especially if its long term, but I think for me, in retrospect (which is truly always 20/20), there were a lot of things that happened that I just didnt tell my friends about, because I knew that if any one of the very reasonable, rational people that I trusted heard some of the crazy hills he chose to die on, they would have told me what I already knew on some level - that it was crazy, and that there was no reason for me to stay with someone like that. 

Saying trust your gut is so much easier said than done - which I seriously understand, but its the advice I wish Id taken. ",AskWomen

I saw two different LCSWs across two years and it honestly didnt do much for me. I guess it was helpful to just have allotted space to talk to someone, but I didnt find the therapy itself to make much of a difference. 

A few years later I went through a ~very~ bad breakup and had a lot to unpack from the relationship itself and I was doing....pretty bad? I started seeing a lan LPC who specialized in domestic violence and honestly her style made a world of difference to me. I think she was just a run of the mill CBT therapist but it was a great fit, and she helped me process things in a way I never could have without her. 

All of thats to say, I think the type of therapist you see is important (my partner has always gone to DBT therapists and it works well for him), but I think even above that, its important that you just find someone you click well with.",AskWomen

username#01087,comment,2019-01-02 06:56,,"Not my personal experience, but my friend. He and his girlfriend (both late 20s) took a break last year after close to six years together to do some soul searching about whether or not they wanted the same things for the future (she for sure wanted kids, marriage, a more settled down life, he was uncertain if he wanted to settle down in one spot period). 

They took a break for a think 3 or 4 months. Their break had very specific terms (regarding seeing other people, etc.) that they both understood and accepted. They dated around, both did individual therapy, then came back together and just got engaged earlier this month (about a year and a half after theyd taken the break). 

I think their situation was incredibly particular and they handled it, somehow, really logically and didnt let their emotions control their behavior (for the most part). They took the time to really evaluate their priorities and figure out if they had a long term future together. 

Super glad they made it work, I love my friend and his girlfriend a lot and think theyre 100% on solid ground. ",AskWomen

I unfollowed/muted my ex and his whole family on social media, and that was huge. At some point I had this very real conversation with myself when I was really caught up thinking about him and I basically said you do not hate yourself enough to keep giving this so much thought, because all it did was cause me so much pain. 

Honestly - to the point of another comment - I finally did get under someone else about six months after wed broken up, and that was the final nail in the coffin of my sadness. Nothing romantic came of my sleeping with this other person, but I was finally in a place to welcome that chapter of my life finally being closed for good. 

For context, Im about 7ish months out of my 3 year relationship. Just the other day I told someone how fucking happy I am that I never have to see or talk to my ex again, and I meant it. Right after the breakup, I deadass looked my friend in the eyes and told him I couldnt imagine a time where I would be not sad about my ex. But I PROMISE you will get there. It will take time and you will have LOW moments. But it will happen.

username#01087,comment,2018-11-18 20:34,,"When I was a senior in high school I worked at a fast-casual restaurant (counter service but plenty of tables to sit and camp out at). There was an older retired cop who came in every single day and would say the most outrageous things to the women who worked there. Most of us were in our teens or early twenties. Through a string of, what I had assumed to be meaningless, pieces of information about myself that I had said in passing to him or others around him at work, he ended up being able to track down my home address and would send me anonymous love letters, poems, flowers and other gifts both to my high school and to my parents house. It went on for about three months before I figured out who had been doing it and quit. He somehow found out where I went to college and sent me something the next year when I was a freshman, but then I never heard from him again (Im 27 now). 

Looking back, I think I knew I was really scared when it was happening, but I think I failed to realize how very gendered the whole thing was. I told a lot of people what was going on, and almost all my peers kind of laughed it off, and so I kind of did too. For the record, I dont actually think this dude would have actually done anything violent - I legitimately believe he thought the whole thing was just a hilarious way to fuck with a teenage girl. I think thats the part thats actually affected me the most - the fact that something like that could have been considered a joke. 

It wasnt until I was legitimately  probably 24 or 25 that I really started to think about what had happened, and how absolutely and deeply fucked up it was. I think Im still kind of teasing out the actual ways that it affected me, but I think it colors a lot of the ways that I think about men and how I generally move through the world.",AskWomen

username#01087,comment,2020-05-12 20:12,,"My first two therapists that I went to for generalized anxiety (your run of the mill problems sleeping, runaway thoughts of worry, etc.) were solidly just ok. Both of them worked in hospital/larger medical group settings, and the approach they both had was very clinical and I didnt find it helpful honestly at all. The first session was basically just them filling out an intake form and checking boxes and asking some very broad and general questions. I continued going back for a bit because I figured I needed to give it time, but my feelings never changed and I never left feeling like the session was particularly useful. I had kind of accepted that maybe I was just someone for whom therapy didnt really work for. 

About 6 months after I stopped going, I went through an extremely rough breakup from a pretty volatile relationship that Id been in for years. As I was desperately trying to stay afloat, I decided to try a new therapist with a different credential (I had seen LCSWs in the past and switched to a LPC). 

The first session she asked me some general questions about me and my history with therapy (if Id been before, what went well, etc), and I gave her the basic summary of my breakup and how I was feeling and dealing with everything. The way she steered the conversation and the questions she asked immediately made me start to think about things in a way I hadnt been able to before. She was warm but challenged me, and when I left after 50 minutes I feel like she already understood me more than either of my previous therapists did after months. I left feeling 10 pounds lighter, and immediately started crying when I left and it clicked like, OH. THIS is what its supposed to be like.

I still struggle with executive dysfunction stuff enough that I started the process to get medicated for ADHD (which in California is a lengthy process which is a whole other rant I have).

&#x200B;

Part of the process was to fill out a questionnaire and give specific examples of things I've experienced. I answered so MANY questions and was really upset remembering my struggles throughout all my schooling. I could not believe that I had so many examples of things that I struggled with. I was left with this feeling of ""why didn't my parents HELP ME"" until I remembered that actually they did help me. I saw tutors and met with my guidance counselors, I was given extra time on tests in elementary school, a couple of my teachers spent a LOT of time working with me individually to come up with strategies to remember things, I even got tested for ADHD and have the results stating that I have it.

&#x200B;

This wasn't limited to just academic things either. The list opened my eyes to just how many ways my life and day to day functioning has been impacted by ADHD, and it was a very weird experience to see a list of things that I didn't realize other people don't struggle with.

&#x200B;

Frustratingly, I'm still not medicated, because I have to get a physical and an EKG and a couple other assessments that I haven't yet done.

My theory is that he realized he started catching feelings and instead of talking about it like an adult (were both 28 godforsaken years old), he just freaked out and disappeared.

It literally was not until my therapist suggested we might classify his behavior as abusive that it finally hit me. We broke up 8 months ago and I still find myself thinking Im just being dramatic when I define it that way. 

My ex was EXCELLENT at making me feel like all of our problems were rooted in my inability to function when things happened that either I didnt like, or couldnt control. Which, sure, to an extent is true - but absolutely was not the root cause of our problems. He really ascribed to the, sorry your feelings got hurt, but if we stop to think about it, its really your fault for having feelings at all method of apologizing. 

Its normal to doubt yourself and your experiences after situations like these. Emotional abusive is, in its very nature, EXTREMELY ambiguous and hard to define when its happening. It can be overtly manipulative (a partner isolating you, having extreme jealousy, needing to know your whereabouts, making you feel guilty for things you know you shouldnt feel guilty about), but it can also be FAR more subtle. For me, it was extraordinarily subtle - thats what makes it so hard to walk away and even accept it for what it was. ",AskWomen

I have a mental health background (have done a lot of academic work regarding emotional health, domestic violence, etc.), and I think somewhere, very deep in my brain, I knew that how I was feeling in my relationship wasnt normal. After it finally ended after three years, I started seeing an amazing therapist. At one of my earlier sessions with her, we were discussing some of the fights my ex and I had, and how those fights had made me feel, etc. after she listened, she said what would it mean to you if we classified some of these behaviors and some of his actions emotionally abusive? And I lost my mind. Having someone else say it was the most validating moment Ive maybe ever had. 

It totally shifted my perspective of the relationship itself, and helped me process the breakup in a better way. It also helped me understand a lot of my own behaviors in the relationship and in the wake of the breakup. Of course there was an adjustment period, and I think the biggest thing is sometimes when Im with new partners, they will say or do something that reminds me how normal, well adjusted people are supposed to act. A lot of times Im still inclined to act like Im with this same guy (like I proactively anticipate fighting about certain things), until someone acts in a rational way and I have a moment of, OH, right, this is what its supposed to be like.

I was really upset at how he would communicate frustration (it felt really aggressive and intense), and I was really hurt. He basically said this is who I am, and if youre hurt by it then thats a you issue, because Im not changing for anyone. 

Not only did it feel like an unnecessary hill for him to die on (one of many), and made me feel like his stubbornness was always going to trump my emotions, but it also made me realize how diametrically opposite our understanding of partnerships were. Im of the opinion that a partner should push you to grow and be better (of course, within limits), and he felt like loving someone should be enough to bury any issue you might have with how they act. I recognize the healthiest relationships are probably a balance of these.

Took a couple years off BC before getting back on and went for the patch for round 2 because I hated taking the pill everyday. Patch was GREAT, except it made my migraines more frequent, and more intense. It was the only negative side effect I encountered but unfortunately it was enough to force me to stop using it. 

Finally went for the hormonal IUD two years ago and cant possibly say enough positive things about it. Havent had a period in over a year, my migraines are more manageable and less frequent.

username#01090,comment,2016-12-22 03:44,,"Agh I meant to comment on this earlier but apparently I hit cancel instead of save? I know it's been hours, but I wrote this hours ago so harrumph.

To preface: I am white. ""Minority"" is in quotes because I'm pretty sure white people are the actual minority these days.

These representation criteria are contradictory because PoC and other ""minority"" characters are underrepresented. People are complex and have different motivations, desires, and feelings. When there's only one character of the ""minority"" group, they are the de facto authority on how all others in that group behave. The easiest way to avoid having frustratingly shallow or even harmful representation is to have multiple people from each ""minority"" represented.

Brooklyn 99 is an excellent example of how to do this, because the cast consists of 2 white men, 2 black men, 2 latina women, and 1 white woman. One of the black men is married to a white man, the other to a black woman. The latina women have wildly different personalities (neither one is the ""spicy latina""). There are two more white men who play more background characters, and even they are given characteristics beyond ""fat and bad at their job.""

When there's one ""minority"" character, they are going to be a token character and they are going to fulfill stereotypes/racist tropes (because there are so many and they are often contradictory). Multiple characters from the same ""minority"" group can act differently, establishing themselves as dimensional people and not falling into stereotyping (as easily).",AskWomen

username#01087,comment,2019-01-06 21:09,,"I write letters! I find that the majority of my stress is typically from my personal relationships (which is generally what I value the most). 

I dont typically find writing for the sake of writing helpful (Ive never found much luck sustaining consistent journaling), but I do find it helpful if its prompted (think like a 5-year journal format). My therapist turned me onto the letter writing thing. When I feel stressed or upset and those feelings are tied to someone else, I write them a letter. I never send them,  but it helps me process my emotions. 

I believe this is actually also a pretty frequent method of gratitude journaling too. If you want to get in the practice, you can write letters to people who you want to thank, or people youve lost touch with you wish you hadnt, or people you feel like you need to make amends with. Its a good reflective exercise even if it doesnt directly address the stress youre feeling. ",AskWomen

username#00955,comment,2020-08-15 23:28,,"Actually, this is wrong. According to the DSM5 you must meet ALL three of these criteria to be diagnosed:

An individual who has had arousing fantasies about, urges for, or behaviors with a prepubescent child or children.

The individual has acted out these sexual desires, or is experiencing significant distress or difficulty as a result of these desires.

The Individual is 16 years of age, and at least five years older than the child or children noted in Criterion A.

So, you can only have this disorder if you ACT upon the desires or you are distressed by the thoughts with prepubescent children. Even viewing child pornography is a grey area, because are you acting upon it if you havent masterbated? If its anime? So this is not the best indicator for the disorder either. Before you act upon it, it is considered a sexual orientation or preference.






I just want to clarify that I am not saying this to take away from victims of abuse. I in no way condone pedophilia, it can ruin a life. I do, however, think it would help to reduce the amount of people acting upon their urges if we treated them with less disgust and more of a willingness to help... as difficult as that may be.",memes

username#00839,comment,2020-08-24 04:55,,"I literally just got mine a couple weeks ago so you wouldnt be too far behind. I used a Celestron C8 Deluxe, which I bought from the Cloudy Nights website. Its also a great place to ask any questions that you have.

My setup was $650 all said and done but thats a bit overkill because the C8 is kind of a monster. For you, it depends on what youd like to photograph. Planets? Nebulae? Galaxies? The stuff outside of our solar system is grouped into one classification: Deep Sky Objects (DSOs). The entry level price for photographing DSOs is, unfortunately, astronomically high (no pun intended) so if planets are more your thing that would be perfect for the wallet. I would look into it more as I am not a great source, but perhaps a Dobsonian would be good for you, which is a reflector. It has the best price-per-inch of aperture, which decides how much light is collected by the telescope (hint: bigger is always better). 

If you want something really easy to transport and arent super serious about the hobby, then a cheaper refractor might work, but I would advise against this. A third type, catadioptric, combines both reflecting and refracting in a relatively compact and portable design. I have a catadioptric telescope. The price point is predictably midrange, so basically >400 if you consider buying used. However, if youre okay chasing the object you photograph (i.e. you dont mind not having a motorized tracker), I highly recommend a Dobsonian reflector due to its capability at the price.

Sorry for the essay! Please DM me if you have any other questions, but keep in mind Im just starting myself so I may not be able to give you the most experienced advice.",pics

username#00919,comment,2023-03-01 02:44,,"It's emblematic of the whole ""cover up or you'll distract the boys"" thing. Boys are often made the scapegoat of an authority just trying to enforce their prudish rules.

Happened in my high school. We had no explicit dress code. People could wear whatever they wanted as long as it wasn't absurd. Girls wore spaghetti straps and crop tops and yoga pants and short skirts. Nobody cared and there were no incidents.

Then the school got a new principal. She was religious. She instituted a strict explicit dress code. But she couldn't just say she was enforcing her religion's modesty values on the students. So she repeated the often-told story that it was all about boys. Those disgusting, dangerous boys who can't control their hormones that make them irrational and distracted.

The boys all thought the dress code was stupid and unnecessary. I couldn't find a single boy that thought it was a good idea.


But the scapegoating mostly worked. Girls and their moms became resentful of the boys of the school, and the principal (the person in a position of authority who had actually created the policy) was able to deflect blame and criticism onto the boys.

Somebody wrote ""Don't tell us what to wear, teach the boys not to stare"" on the school in chalk and I have to admit me and a few other boys were rolling our eyes at that. None of us supported the dress code. It was the principal and her religious evangelism who was telling the girls what to wear.",facepalm

Who knows if someone would actually not follow through with the trashtag challenge and post about it (spreading more awareness) because of the perceived bragging that theyre doing? But lets be real, there is a definite community of backlash against people posting things on social media just for the likes and not because they actually care.

It has definitely made me think about posting some things in the past because I did not want to be perceived as bragging. I hadnt donated blood in a while until a couple months ago I saw someone who did on Instagram. So I went and donated. I likewise posted myself having blood drawn. I considered not doing so, but at the end of the day, Im happy I did because someone else I know also donated blood as a result. Just a personal anecdote, but yeah, I considered not posting something that I believed to be worthwhile for the fear of being seen as someone who brags or looks down on people who dont donate blood (which is ridiculous, of course I dont). But because I did, someone else also did and maybe some more who didnt tell me.

Maybe I overreacted, and if I did, it wasnt a personal attack against you. It was an overreaction to what I see as an overreaction of what I was just describing above.

Anyways, sorry if Im rambling. Being realistic is a great life skill to have. I just opt for more optimism in this scenario because at the end of the day, its not going to hurt anyone. Just the way I personally see it in this situation.",pics

There are very few alternate universes in which you bought at $500 and sold at $10K

Copy paste this into wolfram.

8/2(2+2)

It's 16, and obviously so.

(2+2) = 4.

Replace

8/24

Division and multiplication have the same precedence, so divide first, left to right

8/2 = 4

Replace

4*4 = 16.

Rasmussen attempts to only poll likely voters. This generally lines up with more conservative voters. This is not a great metric though because it is very hard to determine who votes in any specific election and for what reasons.

Rasmussen also tends to sample land lines. Find me an 18 year old with a landline.

If you want to go the full 1k though you can spend the rest on outfiting a truck to have de-ionized water and a generator. It will take a couple jobs before you get your investment back but my advice would be to start with just 200, buy a couple cheap microfiber towels a small pack of brushes and some cleaners from autozone and work your way up from there",facepalm

I had a girl complain that I requested sex in lieu of payment as a cab driver.

I got called to the depot. I thought that I was being fired. It was worse when I got there and the police were present.

Then I heard the allegations and said that no such thing occurred, and in fact she didn't have enough to cover the fair and I just told her to get out and that I was going to report her address for non-payment. Since it was her parents house that meant the father would not be able to use our company for his weekly airport call.

That's when the depot manager turned on the TV with the police there and showed the cameras for that ride and sure enough, exactly what I stated was what happened.

That girl was going to try to have me arrested just so that her father didn't learn that she stiffed the cab driver when he called and found his place was 86ed.

Thankful for the cameras for that exact reason. Protected my ass from allegations.

I later received 3x the fare she didn't pay when she got caught in her lie. Just a random deposit made. Probably the father settling the hold on his address.",facepalm

username#00919,comment,2023-01-31 19:01,,"> The point is, if a man wants to be a father, he just has to produce some sperm

You're missing the part where the sperm has to go into a womb.

You're comparing the biological necessities. The man ejaculates, the woman goes through pregnancy.

We're talking about the social necessities. For a man to have a baby, he has to find a willing partner or pay for a surrogate, since he himself doesn't have a womb. He's dependent on the willingness of another person to have a child with him.

For a woman, if she wants to have a baby, she can do it all herself without being dependent on others. She can visit a sperm bank, and then carry the pregnancy herself.

Yes, being pregnant is hard work, but it's work women are able to do. Men can't do it even if they want to.


The uterus/womb is pretty much an extra organ that men don't have. It's like if I were missing all my limbs, while you had all four. I'm saying ""damn I wish I had limbs"" and you're saying ""well I have to work, while you just sit around, so you're the lucky one""",AskReddit

An abortion is something that we can not govern over others. The choice, the process, the loss is all their own to go through. 

To pass a law that does not allow this is just so those who oppose can pat themselves on the fucking back and act like they have done something.

I have like no information about them either except that my foster mom was in her 20s and had a daughter before me and was an alcoholic. And for all I know, that could be entirely made up to make my parents feel better about adopting me.

Basically the agency makes it impossible to find the biological parents/siblings without their help. It's probably to more or less force assimilation. I was only a couple months old when I was adopted anyway, so I grew up with pretty much no knowledge of Korean culture or anything. I wish I could've had more exposure to where I'm from, but I'm trying to make up for it now.

Only valid in a system like American where they don't have an independent review board. The country in question (UK) *does* have an independent review board. 

> They can claim independence all they want, people have realized that cops stand by cops regardless of moral or legal challenges.

Unfounded and untrue. There are many countries where cops are well respected and well trained. 

>""Good person"" and ""good cop"" are incompatible traits. Being one makes it impossible to be the other.

This is an even worse unfounded accusation. (For the record, this type of rhetoric is what tells me you are unwilling to have an honest discussion).

>Pretending anyone with a badge will be honest during this investigation is laughable.

Do I actually need to say anything about this? Please tell me there's never been a cop who has stood up to other cops, testified against other cops, whistleblown against cops, etc. 

>Hiding their names has NOTHING to do with the ""integrity"" of the investigation.

Unlike America, many countries hold names until after an investigation in order to protect all parties involved. This prevents people from vilifying and attacking said people until after a trial has occurred. 

> You just heard me express an idea you dislike, and assumed I was terrible and unreasonable.

The things you have said **are** unreasonable. You are making assertions based on a bias you have (most likely because of where you have grown up and what you have seen in your country) and made the leap to thinking that this it true globally. 

>but I'm sitting here willing to explain my point while you're running away and saying I can't even be spoken to.

Making unfounded assertions with a clear bias and responding in absolutes makes it near impossible to have a clear and good conversation. See your quote: ""That's true of every cop, everywhere."" All you are doing is shoving your fingers in your ears and ignoring what anyone is saying so you can hold on to your misguided ideals.

I can forgive the person for stealing candy, even if they dont seem to actually feel any remorse, but I cant forgive the person who committed murder and spent the rest of his life trying to redeem themself (at least from the external public eye).

Pulling numbers out of my ass, but hypothetically, what if out of all the rehabilitated and in good standing ex-cons, 75% of them have had a genuine change of heart and recognize the errors of their pasts. The other 25% still externally are playing by the rules now, but maybe they dont necessarily feel remorse. Do we condemn all ex-cons because of that 25%?

username#00793,comment,2024-05-29 13:31,,"Years ago I was hired at a science-based nonprofit in Michigan to lead the organization's science efforts. I would be the only staff member (at the *science* organization) with a PhD. They offered me $66k to start (which was low for my qualifications), but promised that within a year they would promote me which would come with a $20-30k raise, which I was ok with since the job seemed cool. I accepted, which was stupid because it was not in the offer letter.

After 10 months of my director being completely non-transparent, I booked a meeting with the president of the organization myself. I laid out my case and stated this was what I was promised. She claimed she had never heard anything about this supposed position, and said if I gave her some time she might be able to give me a 1-time $3k raise. She made over *$600k/yr*. I quit then and there and got a job paying me $40k more, and much to my amusement, the non-profit continued to contact me for months after I left asking me to help them, which of course, I did not.",news

I didnt love being pregnant the first time because I was sick and nauseous for several months in the beginning. I hate being nauseous. I also had to have a c section and not to mention the ungodly amount of money that went to daycare every week. There are many factors why I dont want another baby but on the flip side I do want another baby, just not 100%. When we had our first one, my husband was gone a lot working on the road which made everything so much worse as far as our relationship number 1, and I felt like a single mother raising a child alone but with child support. With my hormones, we would argue often about it. 
Now times are different. My husband doesnt work on the road anymore and would be present for another baby, but to be honest, Im scared too. He asked me why I was scared. I said, Im afraid of being sick again and not able to work. Im afraid of being cut open again via c-section. Its a major surgery whether you want to believe it or not. I dont want to put a baby in daycare again with the expense when ours is about to go into kindergarten. Not to mention the crippling anxiety that would come with a new baby because I already have GAD and chronic worry with just one.

I am assuming she didn't get it until it was at a minimum 6 weeks old and could be separated from its mother. So she gets the kitten and gives it to you after 2.5 months at the most? For 1-3 months?

On top of her wanting you to keep it in a confined space (for the record I agree with you on this being a bad idea) she wants to take it away from its territory (your house) and its person (you after this amount of time) after giving it up during a bonding period of its life? From experience, it's really hard to car train a cat unless it starts very early. Introducing a car to an older kitten, ESPECIALLY one that has been confined to a single room reeks of ""bad idea."" Frankly your mother's whole treatment of the kitten -- regardless of intent -- is borderline animal cruelty.

If you are having misgivings it is because you are compassionate and putting the needs of a baby animal above her unrealistic expectations.

Shes definitely out of line bringing her family into it, no doubt about it, but now youre in a pickle and need a way out. If it were me, Id look at the ongoing costs of the place and any major repairs/additions the two of you might wish to do (add bedrooms for kids or for an office space, add a garage, whatever). Write up an agreements that the house and land is yours outright, but what she pays into the taxes/maintenance/upgrade costs is part of her equity in the property, and theres some sort of way that gives her a buy in for investment purposes if someday you separate. No clue how youd do it legally, but Im sure your lawyer could help with that.

Also, since this is already an issue with her family, sounds like its time for a prenup. Its not about believing the marriage will fail-its about agreeing on what is fair and equitable while you are in good terms, to smooth any issues further down the road if your marriage ends.

username#01104,post,2020-05-17 23:16,AITA for ending a 10 year long friendship?,"This happened over 2 years ago but I still think about this. 

Backstory: Friend, well name her Tiffany (currently 25F), and I (25F) were best friends growing up in California. Went to the same elementary, and she ended up moving to Las Vegas. Several years later, my parents uprooted me to Las Vegas. We connected via MySpace and found out she still lived in Las Vegas and was about 20 mins away from me. Best friends ever since. 

When she turned 23, she met a guy (divorced and 30 at the time) and immediately fell head over heels with him. He had a lot of red flags about him, but she didnt care. Finally, after 8 months of serious dating, he popped the question and she said yes. We all had our issues with this, especially her mom, but we kept our mouths shut and supported her 100%. 

The falling out: She wanted to have a destination wedding in Virginia where his/her (dad) family lived. Her entire mothers side of the family + her fiances side of the family lived in Las Vegas, including all of their friends. The only people she would be accommodating in Virginia is her dad and his grandparents. And it just seemed more reasonable to have a Las Vegas wedding. But plans for Virginia were still kept. 

She also wanted to have the bridal party stay for a total of 5 days (3 weekdays and 2 weekend days), chip in for all bridal party duties (dresses, makeup, hair, party, and her expenses at the hotel) and a full nights sleepover (with all 8-9 of her bridal party) in her hotel room the night before the wedding. After calculating cost, airfare, hotel expenses for fiance and I, and working things out with my job - It was a total of $4,000 + Vacation time that I simply did not have. I spoke with my boss who offered unpaid leave, but I couldnt simply do that, since I lived on my own with my fiance at the time. 3 full days without pay was simply not in the budget ON TOP OF a 4K wedding bill since I lived paycheck to paycheck. This was a lot of money for 23 yo me at the time. 
 
I explained this to my best friend and I told her that as much as I would love to be there on this day, I cant afford to go or miss work. BUT I would pay for everything as a bridesmaid and give up my spot (Still about $2,000) so she can still have everything she wanted + some. She simply said that i was being selfish because I didnt plan for her wedding, and should do everything I can for her wedding. She stopped talking to me and blocked me on all social media.  

Its been 2 long years now and I still think about this almost a few times a year. AITA? Should I have tried harder??",AmItheAsshole

username#01082,post,2020-03-04 01:18,AITA for calling a supervisor over a USPS worker because he was rude to me?,"I needed to find a box to ship a package today on my lunch break. I found a box at work that had product logos and some writing on it. I don't ship boxes often but I knew I probably needed to cover up the markings. I decided to call a postal service number and ask what I specifically needed to do so I could ship this box. When I called I was directed to the USPS number at our local college campus. A nice lady answers and told me I just need to get a sharpie and mark out logos and any writing and I should be fine. Enough enough. 

Once I finished, I drove up to a USPS location closer to me and went inside where I stood in line for awhile. More people started coming in and waited behind me. When I finally got called up, this older man who had been working there for years asked how he could help me. I told him I needed to ship this box. He looks at the box then back at me awkwardly and says ""you know you can't ship this box because of this label right?"" I evidently missed a small logo on the side of the box. I said ""well, the lady at the college USPS location said I needed to mark out the logos and..."" but before I could finish, he interrupts me and rudely announces to the people behind me (literally makes an announcement with a loud voice) ""folks, this girl here is going to listen to an amateur over a professional like me!"" I was shocked. I said ""you know what, forget it."" I grabbed the box, turned around to leave when he shouts ""go back to the college campus!""

I got in my car and was pretty upset and embarrassed how he deliberately tried to humiliate me and make me look stupid. I was trying to do the right thing with the box so it would be easy to just ship it and go, hence why I even tried to call beforehand.

I later found a better box with no markings at all, repackaged it and went back up to the same USPS store. When I walked in, that old man was helping someone else so another lady helped me and shipped the new box no problem. I asked her (with the old man close enough to hear me) if there was a number for a manager or supervisor for this store because of an issue earlier. She said yes and gave me a number that I later called and told my experience. They issued an apology but who knows if they'll even say anything to him at all. Was I the asshole for being a Karen and calling the supervisor because he was so rude to me?",AmItheAsshole

I feel like you're already giving up hope that you'll get into these schools before a decision has even been made, and assuming that ethnicity is the only qualifying factor.  Test scores, grades, essays, etc all combine together into what makes up a college application.  I'm sure the ire of your friends is in your assumption of facts before the results are in.  

That, and race is an explosion of opinions and centuries of historical circumstances that have led us to where we are today.

Though, I'm marking this as ""NAH"", because I actually don't know the specifics of where you are going and where you are applying to, or what history they have regarding affirmative action.

*You because*: 
The entitlement. 'Expecting' her to cover for you financially like she owes it to you, while you're an adult. Even in marriages, you don't by default 'expect' that someone covers for your expenses when you clearly haven't agreed upon anything such or discussed financial scenarios like this beforehand. You cannot just spring this on your partner and low-key demand they change your existing financial arrangement just because it conveniences you. You either discuss things beforehand, or you take accountability and dig your own way out. If she helps out, that's her being generous, but it's not something you're just 'supposed to' get. 

*She because*: 
She has chosen a moment of crisis to leverage her position to be able to help you out, in order to get what she wants. She knows you're not ready for whatever reason, and marriage is not the kind of thing where you should pressure someone you care about to rush their timeline if they don't feel ready. It's not that she won't give you the money; it's the fact that she has made the financial help conditional upon a marriage proposal *knowing"" that you're somewhat desperate and likely to give her what she wants in this situation, even though you are not ready to make the same offer under normal circumstances where you are not unemployed.

If he fails, at the very least he can go on with life knowing he tried.  If he succeeds, he has a future ahead of him doing what he loves the most.

I'll try to make this too laborious but give a little back story.  My fh is about 20 years older than me (I'm in my early 40s) and had been divorced for a couple years before we met. He wanted the divorce; she didn't. They have three children together that are all in their 30s.  His children didn't know he was dating anyone until there was a medical issue and found out about me. 

Fast forward a year and a half later he's  planning to propose and he tells all of our children before he does. His children insist upon telling their mother BEFORE he proposes to me so that she doesn't find out on social media. (They don't follow one another). I was adamant she didn't need to know before as they aren't friends and aren't coparenting children. He explained he would tell her but on his own time. His children chose to tell her before he proposed anyway. I found this out while we were out of town, after he proposed. I was very upset that his children did what they wanted anyway and were completely disrespectful to his and my wishes. It has caused arguments between us. He is a rather passive person and doesn't like to address things; he's rather avoidant. I, on the other hand, would rather address something and let it be aired out.

We are now a few months before our wedding and it has never been discussed. What's done is done, and that can't be changed but I do feel a conversation needs to happen in regards to his children disrespecting us both by telling their mother even though we didn't want her to know ahead of time. I know without a doubt this man is my person but I struggle with this situation. To be clear.. it's not a dealbreaker or even close. I just need to get it off my chest.  So, am I the asshole?

1. The post mentions nothing whatsoever about how you feel about your husband as a person, and what your relationship is like post marriage. You have given his family an ultimatum that can end in divorce - what is his role in all this? Is he a chess piece here for you to get the wedding you want or does he actually even matter to you as a person? It sounds like you're willing to give up your marriage over having a glam ceremony if it comes down to it, which makes me question the quality of this marriage to start with. 


2. Are you and your husband from the same culture and same financial backgrounds? From your cultural references, it sounds like you're likely from somewhere in South East Asia, but I might be wrong. If you come from a lot of money and he does not, you would need to discuss things like how to finance your dream wedding, or that the wedding is such a deal breaking big thing for you, BEFORE getting married in the first place. 

3. When you married him mainly for his visa status, was it clearly understood and agreed upon between you two that he would be required to pay you back in some form for this?

I (20F) was talking to my boyfriend (32M) about the idea of applying to Hooters, and when I asked how hed feel about it, he said hed find it icky. I understood his answer, but I pointed out that it seems hypocritical for guys to enjoy places like Hooters or Twin Peaks but then get upset if their partners want to work there.

He said its all about relationships and perspective, arguing that if youre in a relationship, you shouldnt be at Hooters unless your partner is okay with it. I told him that I think its unfair if guys who go to those places even when they were single and stopped after being relationship get to dictate whether their partners can work there when they support those establishments by eating there in the past.

He found my view odd and disagreed, saying just because a guy eats there doesnt mean he supports the jobs there or his gf to work there. He mentioned the guys could be just going there for the food not for the girls. I said that if youre going there knowing what its about and advertised as, youre supporting it. It feels hypocritical to enjoy the restaurant but not want your partner to have the same opportunity to be a worker.

Weve been going back and forth on this, and Im feeling frustrated. I know I might not be completely right, but I think I have a point. AITA for being upset about his reaction?

I'll be the first to admit that as a manager myself, wording and finding feedback to give to employees is difficult.  Because if you're too harsh, you're going to have a bitter employee that thinks you're out to get them, but if you're too kind, then they won't work on improving themselves.  There needs to be a happy medium in work evaluations, and is a source of constant stress for me.  

So while I was readying myself to jump to the manager's side, with the information I've been given, I can't actually do that.

What you got here was not a point of improvement.  ""Smile more"" or ""interact more"" in an office job where you're doing everything correctly is bad feedback.  

Unless you are bringing a toxic atmosphere to the work environment (which sounds like you don't since you only work at your desk and the only ""complaint"" was not bringing your personal life to work), or unless you've had customers complaining about you for being rude/bitchy (which it sounds like they aren't), then this shouldn't have even been brought up.  

""Out of work drinks"" = not liking coworkers?  I also disagree with this logic.  I've worked with the same company (accountant) for going on 6 years now, and other than our yearly Christmas party, one time when I gave somebody a lift home, and the occasional lunch treat for my team, I don't have any contact with my coworkers outside of work.  Blending the lines between professional and private lives rarely go well for anyone.  Though with your job being in a college area, I could see where there might be a little more blurring of those lines.

Asking about medications or your personal life is not really appropriate either, and depending on the context, could be really bad for the college if she ever went ""too"" far.  Do not feel obligated to disclose your anxiety/depression with anyone, or what medicines you are taking, or what side-effects there are of the medication.

I'm not sure how your performance evaluation works, but with my company, there is usually a section to offer ""feedback"" on the evaluation, and offer counter-arguments to critiques.  If such a thing is available, be professional, courteous, and do not come at it from an combative tone, but rather just clearly state that you disagree with the evaluation based on reasons X Y and Z, and will continue to do the job to the best of your ability.

So, no, in summary, you are not an asshole.",AmItheAsshole

I have been with my partner for 10 years.

He likes the windows closed overnight due to noise.
I like them at least on security for air circulation and temperature control (I get warm overnight). 

I have tried sleeping naked, with nothing covering me (which I hate for reasons below), while also on tablets that make me sweat. (The tablets are anti anxiety,  due to a previous bf, who was sexually abusive).

My partner has never tried sleeping with the windows slightly open,  or with earbuds to help with noise. 

For the past 10 years I've said to him I struggle to sleep, and he has said he does too. The issue is I've tried to compromise, and he hasn't. Is his sleep more important?

Every episode is just a tiny piece of one larger story, which, by itself alone, is mostly boring to watch. 
A lot of times you find that nothing interesting is happening and useless moments such as a main character having a drink or going from point A to B are horribly  over emphasized just to seeminglykill time. Then they get you slightly excited at the end to keep you unsatisfied and eager to wait another week for the next episode..

Take the old Star Trek shows for expample: while there was a larger storyline each episode was still interesting in itself because it had its own central theme and cliffhangers. You can pick x episode watch it and have a proper experience.",unpopularopinion

People are trying to colonize Mars in case Earth becomes un-inhabitable. Colonizing the moon would be useless since it spins around the Earth, so if something tragic enough happened to Earth for it to become un-inhabitable it's safe to assume the moon would also be screwed by either being destroyed, becoming un-inhabitable as well or floating off into space.

Additionally, you say the moon isn't affected by much, even though the moon is hit by asteroids literally all the time.

>Now yes Mars has more gravity and an atmosphere but the gravity is still pathetic and the atmosphere is 1% of Earth's so doesn't really help us, just makes landings, building, and generally everything harder.

So Mars is bad because it's hard to build on, but you're fine with the moon, where it's even worse. Got it.

Another thing I saw you mention is that instead of farming on Mars, we could bring soil on the moon, but you have to think about how difficult that would be, how much it would cost and that as the colonies grew we'd have to bring more and more resources.

I'm probably araphrasig the quote, but you get what I mean. This and the fact that Jesus prays to God leads me to believe they are two people with the same mission, which is the only reason they can be considered ""one.""

The older I get, the more comfortable I am with the idea that God might be more human than we give Him credit to be. This explains his acts of outrage so we'll. If you created something based on yourself, you would be pissed when they acted out of line maybe, right? I think, although it was too late,  he realized that rage and doom wasn't the answer and so thought of putting Jesus on Earth to try and balance things out. Jesus is extremely human. He bleeds like any of us, which why his existence was important; humanity now has a good day figure they can better relate to.

So, Jesus goes around teaching the Good Word thinking that this was his life now.  It God kept something from him and doesn't tell him until later, ""Hey, because of too many people sticking to my old ways and not wanting come around with this hot fire you're dropping, they are going to absolutely murder you."" So Jesus does His will, BUT don't forget! He didn't want to. It's written that he kept asking God until he knew God wouldn't change his mind... So yeah. Two different people. ",unpopularopinion

There is no air vents or any kind of air circulation design implemented in a suit with a long sleeved dress shirt.
The jackets do neither keep you warm , nor can they close all the way, they are dangling half open on the one button you are supposed to close.

It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other words? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take 'good,' for instance. If you have a word like 'good,' what need is there for a word like 'bad'? 'Ungood' will do just as well--better, because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of 'good,' what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like 'excellent' and 'splendid' and all the rest of them? 'Plusgood' covers the meaning, or 'doubleplusgood' if you want something stronger still...In the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words--in reality, only one word.

If the person came back before that time they were allowed to discard the sticky note and keep the chair.

But if the staff saw stuff still unattended past the time on the note they'd clear the stuff off the chair so another patron could use it.",mildlyinfuriating

I also live in NYC, so its easy to spend $100k. Those same people typically bitch that theyre broke and cant go anywhere in life. They do not realize the monthly total they are spending on going out to eat, or having food delivered. 

Thats all fine and dandy, its their choice. 

Your dad probably has better financial discipline than you (as he should) and is trying to teach you by cracking jokes. If you are spending money on convenience food, you must have a lot to waste is the theory. Especially if you live with them and dont pay rent, it makes you look a bit unrestrained. You need to explain to him that youve budgeted for this, and he may ease off your case. Theres never any issue with someone setting aside and using fun money however you want. I would assume your dad doesnt think Uber eats is fun money, might help to let him know.",mildlyinfuriating

Danish archeologist Lotte Hedeager writes in detail on this process in her book ""Iron Age Myth and Materiality."" Page 143 goes into detail on the process. The quick of it is that we *know* Viking swords were often carburized, and Hedeager suggests that it was likely with ground up bone which would be placed in a sealed container with iron, making a stronger-than-iron but not quite as a good as refined-steel sword. 

Her hypothesis is bolstered by repeated discoveries of bone ash near forge sites, otherwise unexplainable pits of ashes near cemeteries that are too small to be funeral pyres, and instead resemble the remains of something a smith would use to carburize a sword.

It's not proven that this is exactly what happened, but there's supporting evidence, and the actual science of the carburization process check out.",mildlyinfuriating

Do not discuss feelings or anything else. Just ask her out on a date.

He really isnt the phone sex type of person and while we are together he will literally rip my clothes off me, but when we speak over the phone we can speak for hours and when I tell him I am Horny or I just wanna have phone sex, all Im met with is a me too from him. Yes I have spoken to him before about this and it will be two weeks of him trying to be more lovey dovey over the phone and then it just stops, today was my breaking point however because we literally had a 3 hour long FaceTime conversation where I was sitting naked but not naked where he can see but rather where he knows I am naked and I was met with nothing. Now I am an extremely emotional person and he isnt which made it even more difficult for him to understand why I was hurt and I know that he isnt the over the phone type of person but it just hurts when I dont receive the same sexual attention that he would give me face to face. Has anyone ever been through this and how did you guys manage ???",relationship_advice
username#01008,post,2021-04-18 06:14,I (F21) said very mean things to my ex (M29),"This is gonna be a long one. So please bear with me. 

My ex had sex with the day we broke up. We broke up at 2:30am and he did it at around 5:00pm. When he told me this on Friday, I told him very mean things. I knew his insecurities so I knew how to hurt him bad. 

Okay, that's not the only reason I said spiteful things to him. Here's the full context. We broke up on Monday morning. He did it Monday afternoon. On the night of the same day, he covered a song for me and edited a montage of our photos and videos and told me that that's gonna be the last video he'd send me. The next few days, we would occasionally chat and ask each other how we were. I found out on Wednesday that he added the girl that I was jealous of (context: when we were starting, he already told that girl that he was exclusively dating someone but she still sent a photo of her in an underwear so I made him cut her off). Throughout the week, we would call for a bit but I already told him that that was not how breakups work so he had to learn how to live without talking to me. 

On Friday, I finally decided that okay, I was gonna give this relationship another chance. We talked for hours about what we needed to improve on so our relationships would be better. When I found out that he added the girl I was jealous of, I also added back my friends whom he was jealous of (whom in no way disrespected our relationship by sending nudes to me while I was in a relationship, but they were previous flings). I also made an alter account in twitter (an alter account is an account where you don't show your face and oftentimes, the content there is sexual and suggestive). Last Wednesday, on the same day I made an alter, he found out that I had one so he asked me to deactivate it until we sort our things out. I did it apprehensively, as a respect for him.

So back to Friday when we were telling each other what needed to change for us to work better. One of his non-negotiables was my alter account so he demanded it in exchange for his account. He told me not to delete anything on my inbox there so I did not. So we exchanged accounts. Later on, I found out that he deleted three of his conversations with other girls because he was flirting with them. I got mad at him because that was unfair but we got past that. I am a vengeful person so at first, I told him to give me back my alter for two days so I could flirt with others just like he did. He was oddly okay with it, I knew him, he was an extremely jealous guy so it was odd for him to be okay with that. But then I swallowed my pride and decided that moving forward, I had to change that attitude. 

When we were almost done and we're almost together, he dropped the bomb. He told me he would come clean: he had sex with another girl. He told me he did it to get over me and after he did it he realized that he didn't want to do it with anyone except for me. He said it was his default reaction. To some extent, he justified by saying that I did not treat him well that's why he needed validation from another person to fill the gap I  left. 

I scrapped everything off and told him that we're over and that I'd ask my friends to cut him off entirely. I also hurt him by saying spiteful things to him about his insecurities. 

I told my friends about this and they were mad at him. They tweeted mean stuff to him, even messaged him that he was a ""sad boy manipulative"", etc. Maybe he saw their tweets so he made a poll on his twitter asking if having sex after a breakup is ok and his twitter friends validated that yes it was okay and it was cheating (which I never said it was, and that was not the point, the point was 1. he did it not even 24 hours after our breakup and 2. he asked me unfair things like deactivate my alter and not delete messages which he himself did). We had a groupchat where we tore him apart by saying mean things about him. I'm not gonna lie, every insult my friends tell stung me a bit. I mean I still have feelings for him, more hatred but some affection and possibly even love, a bit of it. Then he messaged me. He asked me to talk and clear things out.

I accepted it and called him. He was so calm about it. Sad and calm. He asked me to stop my friends from tweeting about him, which I did. At the end of the call, I realized that we were so mean to him. I asked him if he would still want to be friends (was that okay?) and he said that the things I told him about his insecurities were the most hurtful words he'd received from anyone so he wasn't sure if he would be ready to be friends again. 

Are my actions justified and is it okay that I asked him to be friends?",relationship_advice

This has been planned for two weeks now. I wont lie I didnt love the idea because my husband loves to drink and its been an on going issue for awhile. Hes not a mean drunk but hes annoying and mouthy. Hes also too touchy with me where hell stick his hands up or down my clothes in public without my permission and gets irritated at me when I ask him to stop. Theres been a two times in seven years where hes driven while buzzed up. Ill get furious with him because he could have wrecked or killed a family but he just says sorry I wont do it again. So I have major issues with this. 


He constantly tells me how he wants more nights with no kids so I can let loose and get wild if I drink.. I dont like to drink much and I hate when he tells me that because it makes me feel like Im not fun unless alcohol is involved. I come from an alcoholic mother so I have problems with it that go deeper. When I do drink its usually 4 beer max, if that. He gets defensive when I bring his drinking up so anymore I just dont to avoid an argument. 

Two days ago I came down with horrible allergies where my nose has been running constantly, my head is stopped up and my ears hurt. I told my husband yesterday if I felt like this today then I wasnt gonna go. Never once did I say if I cant go that means you cant either. But honestly, I dont want him to go. Because I dont want him to get drunk and do or say who knows what without me being there. I know I sound like a babysitter but I guess I dont trust him 100%. I didnt tell him that. 

He asked me earlier if I took medicine so I could go bowling. I said I told you yesterday if I didnt feel better I wasnt going. He immediately gets pissed and says so that means I cant go then huh? I said go then, I never said that. But if you get drunk then you can stay at friends house so I dont have to deal with you. He said I can tell by the look in your eye you dont want me to go. Stop acting like my babysitter like I cant do anything without you! I blew up and said I NEVER said that! 

I said that more out of anger because he automatically assumed I didnt want him to go when I never said that. So now everyones pissed and Im crying because he made me feel like I got sick on purpose to get out of going. He just really hurt my feelings.",relationship_advice

Youd think by then it would have come back, but unfortunately it has not. Unless Im tipsy, no sex drive for me. 
As of late, my husband has started passing rude comments about how I never want to fuck anymore and I wish youd ever initiate the sex but I know thatll never happen   Or I wish youd at least act like you enjoy sex on the rare occasion we do it and several comments about me acting like an old lady or that Im no longer fun. When he sees that I get upset, his defense is I was joking. 

Im worried about my low libido ruining our marriage. I dont just lay there like a dead fish, I do enjoy the sex once were at it, but hes right, I dont even initiate it because I dont ever want to..

When they had COVID, I ordered them food and skin care masks from Amazon. When I accomplish something or when Im proud of myself, they dont return the same energy that I give them when Im celebrating them. I got each of them personal gifts for Christmas, one of them gave me nothing, the other gave me clothes that are obviously way too small for me, and the third regifted something I gave her for Friendsgiving.

username#01008,post,2021-03-08 02:34,Is it okay to hide your feelings from your partner? If it means you have a better relationship and less fights?,"Okay, so here's another one about my boyfriend. Hahaha. 

My boyfriend has a lot of different priorities, like school, his friends, his family, his goals, his ambitions, and his games.
He rarely has time for me, but he tries to squeeze me into his daily routine as much as possible. He even said that I came into his life at such a wrong time. He gets mad whenever I ask for more time or when I feel bad about him not having time for me. Saying I don't respect his time and/or I'm not being supportive.

He also has tendencies of treating me like I don't matter. Like I'm not part of his priorities.  Here are examples:
1. He once stayed at a party we held for my birthday, and when I wanted to go home because I was so drunk, he let me go home, alone and drunk, to our hotel. While he stayed behind for over an hour with his and my friends.
2. He would often fail to update me or text me for hours whenever he's out with his friends. (I mean, I get that, but I would really appreciate an update every now and then, since we're in a long distance relationship)
3. He dismisses our fights and intends to not deal with it or sleep on it whenever he gets pissed  at me.
4. He has tendencies of invalidating my feelings by getting mad at me for feeling  them or arguing about them.
5. He usually doesn't comfort me when I feel bad about our relationship for his unusual lack of effort sometimes, and when he does, it's usually after an argument. 
6. He would casually just walk away from me so he could be with his friends when we argue about something.
7. He constantly says that I like making issues about our relationship, and lacks to see that it is a reaction of his treatment of me.
8. He suggested that we break up, because he says we're hurting each other too much, and acknowledges that it's his lack of effort and understanding that often causes it. He knows he treats me awfully, but usually doesn't do much about it. 
9. Whenever he gets mad, I always run after him, reassuring him that Im here, that I love him, that I care about him, but I don't see him returning the favor for me.
10. He would usually get mad if I don't let him do things that he's asking permission for. Which I believe I have a right to practice, especially if I think the things he wants to do can be a threat to our relationship.

With that in mind, I decided to make a social media dump account, like where I can express my feelings. So I don't have to talk with him about it, so he doesnt get triggered. Mainly because he doesnt like it when I ask for consolation or advice from my friends. And bringing it up to him would often lead to arguments.
I told him this and he somehow got mad at me. Saying I shouldn't be keeping this from him, and that we should talk about them.
But when we do, I often feel invalidated, blamed, judged, and/or diminuted for even feeling those feelings.
I feel like I'm in a rut. Like im running around in circles, blindfolded. 

I don't know what to do anymore, or where to go.
I love him, yes, with all of my heart.
But this has been incredibly draining and exhausting.
I'm not sure if I deserve this kind of relationship.
But I'm choosing to stay because he matters to me so much.

Maybe we have indifferences, maybe we're just incompatible.
But Im so desperate to make this work, even if it breaks my heart more often than I thought it would.
I resorted to making a dump account instead, so I can freely express my feelings without having to discuss them with him. 
But I'm afraid that if I do this, it will only make me feel less about him or not feel anything anymore, developing a numbness from all stimuli due to constant exposure to pain. Desensitization.
And eventually just decide to walk away when I can't take it anymore or when I feel like it would hurt less when I do.

Can someone send some inputs my way?
Would appreciate it.",relationship_advice

I suggest calmly collecting yourself and then writing him an email. Not a text message an email (or a letter). Explain to him how you feel about and use ""I statements."" Say how it makes you feel undervalued and under-appreciated. Suggest that you both sit down (when you're not angry with each other) and set out a division of labor that you can both agree on and stick to.

For instance, maybe you could agree to clean the litter box 1-2 times a day if it really bothers him that much, and maybe he could take on more of the cleaning.

The point is that you both come to a resolution.

If you love him, there's no abuse, and he's not intentionally hurting you or manipulating you, do not give up so easily if it can be worked out.

I'm glad you came here to vent though. That's a positive coping tool!

So either of you have good insurance? Maybe try some short-term couple's counseling (8-12 sessions) as a way to have a safe, neutral space to discuss your challenges.

I just get so insecure about what he's done with them, and he kinda has this sense of pride whenever he talks about what he's done with them, so it kinda throws me off into this self-pity frenzy. 

I keep putting my A-Game whenever we have sex just so I would stand out; so he thinks I'm the best partner he's ever had; so he would think twice about leaving me or cheating on me.

username#01115,post,2020-12-20 17:48,My (24f) best friend (24f) is writing her nursing exam again after failing it four times. I know shell be a great nurse but shes struggling to pass this exam. What can I do to help?,"My (24f) best friend (24f) graduated from nursing 3 years ago, and since then shes taken the nursing licensing exam 4 times and failed. I know shell be a great nurse so I really want to help her pass if I can.

She has a mild learning disability that I think has made it harder for her to pass the test, as well as low confidence and depression which makes it difficult for her to sit down and study properly. Id say I have good study habits. Id like to help her study by making her a schedule and studying with her, but I dont want to make her feel pressured or impact her self esteem in any way, shes very sensitive about her intelligence. She has also never shared any details about her disability so I dont know exactly what it entails and how it impacts her ability to study. 

So people of reddit, how do you think I should support my friend? She says this is the last time she will take the test before giving up. I want to do everything I can to help her pass. Should I offer to help her with her studying or just provide her with emotional support?",relationship_advice

username#01186,comment,2023-10-08 20:31,,"Honey, Im saying this with as much love and care as I can, based on my own experience and that of others I know well: this dude is toxic and is starting to abuse you.

First thing was he kinda moved in-sure its sweet when you spend so much time together and have stuff at each others places. BUT him giving up his flat a)WITHOUT HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT and b) this early in a relationship is a GIANT RED FLAG. Please please dont ignore it!!

Then, all these little things that you dont care about is how manipulation and abuse starts. Always. Its the little things you dont care about, the things you laugh off and say whatever because you know that relationships are about compromise. But already youre the only one compromising, and in your heart you know that, because youre here questioning yourself and asking internet strangers about it.

For the food thing specifically, being poor growing up and having weird favourite foods as a result is a very common and normal thing. Shaming you for that is NOT okay. So long as you are overall eating as healthy as you are able to on your current budget, there is no reason to be discussing food other than expressing interest in your partners likes and dislikes.

All of that said, I think you know this isnt normal. I think you know this isnt right or healthy, and I hope you can take the strength from these responses to do what is best for YOU and move on from this toxic relationship before its harder to do so. Wishing you the very best of strength and luck, you deserve better!!",relationship_advice

username#01186,comment,2023-10-06 00:55,,"I disagree on that last part. Ive worked as a cleaner, and as a housekeeper for a private family. As a cleaner, I know the basics of the house, like what rooms need what tasks, and where the most dirt is. But I dont know where any of your items belong or what things I can and cant move without causing chaos. So Im trained that if I cant pick it up with one hand to clean underneath and put it down, I dont touch it.

As a housekeeper, Im very familiar with that particular family and their needs. I know bills need to go upstairs to the office, kids homework goes on this corner of this table, etc. I know where every cooking utensil belongs when it comes out of the dishwasher because i helped to create the organizational system that gave that thing a home. Im much more able to put literally anything where the occupants of that house would want it, or think to look for it if I organized that space.

Now, as a homeowner, I WILL tidy things away first, so important papers dont get lost, so all the corners that drive me nuts get cleaned properly, and so I can let the cleaners swoop in and do their flurry of cleaning and get out.",relationship_advice

username#01083,comment,2020-12-19 14:24,,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years now. Its honestly amazing and its weird when I tell people this but I really had a  I know Im going to be with this person forever  moment when I met him and all my friends thought I was crazy. 

When looking for a partner I genuinely can say I really looked for everything that he is, honest, hardworking, loving etc. I never had a relationship with my dad and thus it was important for me to find the one that embodied all the qualities that were opposite to my father and I never dated any guy before my boyfriend as I feared commitment and didnt want to be stuck In the same mess as my moms and it resulted in me having quite a few situationships until I met my boyfriend. 

I feel like there is a lot of work that needs to happen personally before coming together and one thing that I always tell everyone is to be strict and honest about what they want in a partner because I genuinely believe that there is someone out there for everyone. 

We are both two completely different people who have the same fundamental values( i dont know if this makes sense). we both come from extremely dysfunctional homes, and as a result we both had the idea and desire to have a relationship that was different from our parents and that made it a bit more easier for us to find each other because we were both extremely strict and honest about what we wanted and it was a long term loving relationship and we didnt want anything else. 

As a couple it took a lot of work in the beginning no joke in terms of communication because we communicate very differently and our childhood trauma really affected the way in which we would communicate with each other and for us it was just us both putting our foots down and deciding that we were not going to let our pasts affect our relationship and we would just constantly do little things to improve our communication. Its about 70% perfect rn but we are both choosing to constantly improve 

I really am so glad to see other people in happy relationships when it literally feels like everyday someone is getting cheated on and its quite sad that many people have the notion that that is what a normal relationship is and are willing to put up with it, maybe being in my house just showed me that that is exactly what I wish not to have.",relationship_advice

username#00955,comment,2020-09-25 18:33,,"Oh girl, how horrible! And just when you feel like youve managed to get through such a traumatic experience of a late miscarriage. 
It sounds like your husband is still going through some stuff of his own? He clearly cares about you otherwise there would be no outpouring of emotion. 
It sounds like you guys need to do some serious communication. Really nut it out together, was he ever attracted to you? Why does he feel like he no longer is? Why is he upset that he doesnt find you attractive? Is there a chance he still unconsciously looks at you and it reminds him of the trauma you went through? (just a stab, I could be totally wrong)
I would also be laying down some boundaries for your own self respect; you wont be getting surgery to fulfill whatever issues HE has, you wont tolerate being spoken down to and compared to other women.

How do I say that I dont want to share a hotel room?,"My daughter (17 years old) and I (39) just moved to Orlando from Seattle together. She seems to have made a good friend at school who seems to be a good influence and just moved here with her mom as well. We had the mother/daughter over for dinner the other night and the mother is extremely intense. She has a very dominating personality and is very loud and intense. I was exhausted at the end of dinner. She expressed that she would love to get together with me and my daughter again which sort of stressed me out. I dont dislike her. I just cant handle too much of her. However, I want to support my daughter being able to make a good friendship here in a new town- and with both of us being in similar mother/daughter situations, it seems fitting to be friends. Recently, the mother expressed that she would like to go out of town to a nearby (2 hours away) beach for New Years Eve/New Years day. She hasnt specified whether or not shes assuming that the four of us would share a hotel room or not. I dont know how to ask her what her expectations are regarding the hotel situation without being awkward. I dont know if I could handle sharing a hotel room with the mother.

Im glad to be on the other side of the relationship, and am doing 1,000% better emotionally.

The thing is, the sex is only okay, at best. I find the sex to feel really urgent? Like, imagine that moment in a romantic comedy where the characters are hooking up for the first time and are just ALL over each other and cant wait another minute to have sex. Dont get me wrong - this is super flattering,  but everything feels really rushed, and he just kind of paws and grabs at me. Hes also a bit smaller than average, and definitely uses condoms a bit bigger than than he should be using. 

Not totally sure what the best course of action here is. Wondering if anyone else had a similar experience with someone who turned into a longer term partner, and if the sexual aspect of the relationship improved? Im not totally sure that thats what Im looking for right now, but like I said - I REALLY enjoy the time we spend together, so I want to give it a fair shot. ",relationship_advice

username#01082,post,2021-11-30 04:42,My (28F) husband (32M) is not supportive of my dream to pursue a different career path. Im afraid itll make me resent him in the future.,"Ive been into photography for years now as a side gig. I make decent money with it but have never had the time to pursue it full time. I also had our second baby 6 months ago. I took maternity leave then went back to work only part time. I hired a sitter for the two days I work. My original plan before maternity leave was to put baby in daycare at 8 months old and go back to full time. Well, here I am 6 months later and my goals and plans have completely changed. I dont want to put our baby in daycare yet. I am not emotionally ready at all and the thought of it makes me sick. 

Its always been my ultimate dream to pursue photography full time where I can work and still be home most of the time with our baby. During my leave from work, I had more time and took several photos for friends and clients from word of mouth. Now more than ever I want to do this full time. The thought of quitting my job to do this sounds blissful. I do not enjoy my job at all. I talked to my therapist about it and they told me I should take this opportunity and soar with it-to not be afraid! I have nothing to lose!

I talked to my husband about it and he said you cant just quit your job and dive in photography. You cant just wake up one day and say, I want to be a photographer. I said umm, Ive been doing this on the side for years now and youre being the only one who isnt supporting me. 

Hes acting as if Ive never picked up a camera before. Ive shot photography since 2016! It was hurtful to hear especially when everyone else (family, therapist) is in my corner. I literally have the skill set, proper tools and knowledge to turn my dream into reality and my husband is not being supportive at all.",relationship_advice
username#01091,post,2023-05-04 14:48,The man (25M) I (26F) love is seeing someone else. Ive never experienced pain like this. How can I overcome this heartbreak? Is it foolish of me to hope that he and I will end together one day?,"A few days ago, I (26F) learned that the man (25M) Im in love with is seeing someone new. Almost 4 years of pure love and friendship with this man. Theyre doing all the things that we used to do. Her lips get to touch his. She gets to be held by him. It hit me like a truck that I might not get to do all of those things with him anymore. It sent me down a horrible downward spiral. The amount of pain I am in is insurmountable.

I attempted to mask my pain by getting bumble and hinge while on a trip to Canada. I thought, perhaps if I do all the things hes doing with someone else, Ill feel better. Perhaps if I my lips touch someone elses, Ill forget what his lips felt like and stop picturing him with someone else.

I matched with so many guys so quickly, it had to be a sign that I should do this. I set up dates, times, and places to meet at least 5 different guys. I truly thought this would make me forget about the pain, about the man I consider the love of my life doing everything we used to do with someone else.

Im a fool. Its kinda funny because I unmatched with every single guy without hesitating after it hit me that I cant do this. I cant picture myself actually going on these dates, much less kissing and caressing someone that isnt him. What a lousy attempt on my end. My love for him is so big, so life changing. Im afraid Ill never love anyone else again. Not even because I cant, but because I dont want to.",relationship_advice

I totally understand this feeling. Particularly if you werent a huge baby person to begin with, then you add in sleep deprivation, breast feeding/formula feeding, huge hormonal shifts, body changes. Your life has just been completely flipped on its head!! 
I did not connect with my baby at all until he started to be less like a lump that just pooped, ate and slept. I remember giving birth and thinking oh, its a baby, ok 

As long as shes doing the things to keep the baby well and safe, Id cut her a bit of slack, as well as yourself! Youre both taking on a whole new challenge and it is difficult, but will get better! 

It is a good idea to give your wife as much support as possible in this time so therapy is a good idea, even just for the fact that your old life is gone and you are both entering into a new one. Maybe therapy together might even be a good idea to show youre supporting her.

username#00926,post,2023-07-08 23:17,I'm (M26) leaving my partner (F21) because she doesn't want to talk to me when I'm in jail,"Ooookaay so I have been with my gf for a little over 2 years. I had a beer too many and got pulled over one night back in January. I was charged with an OVI, and have been awaiting court ever since. I have court on Tuesday, and there is a 50/50 chance I go to jail then. If I do not go then, it will be next week. My sentence is 30 days. Over the last 6 months we have talked about it many times, and she has never seemed keen to talk to me when I'm in jail. Now, she has every right to make that decision, however I have told her that if that is her intention, then it is my intention to end it before I go in. She has 2 reasons she doesn't want to talk to me. Reason 1 is that she is on her mom's phone plan, and does not want her mom to go through her phone records for some reason and see that she is talking to someone in jail. Reason 2 is that she does not want to feel bad for missing a phone call. Now my reasoning behind breaking up over it is this; I know I messed up, and I understand not wanting to be with someone who is going to jail, but why would she want to cut contact for a month and pick up where we left off after? She is going on vacation in Florida for a week while I will be in there with her (F)riend, she has already broken trust before this too, as I found tinder on her phone one time. I'm also going into the scariest, loneliest month of my life and she does not want to talk to me at all during it. She has had 6 months to leave me, but hasn't, and claims she doesn't want to. I've said not wanting to talk to me at all is essentially saying you don't want to be with me. I do not want to break up, but I don't think I'm being unreasonable about this.",relationship_advice

After a year of introspection,a self help book and a lot of time alone, I realized that I am the problem. I realized that a lot of the friendships I made were trauma bonds and as I am trying to work on being a better person through things such as being more positive and just wanting to go out and do more stuff like visiting places or going on short trips, I began to realize that none of the current friends I have want to do any of those things with me, but will always call for us to gossip about someone or just be negative and sit in our rooms all day. I can not necessarily blame them as I know in the past I was that person who was overly obsessed with what others had going on in their lives and Im trying to make a change but regardless of all the change I have put in place to avoid me being the old person I was, I realized that I tend to unconsciously revert back to my negative self talk and negative behaviors when I am with my friends. Moving forward I decided to take some time for myself, I should have communicated this with them I know but I just told them I was at my boyfriends house and he had no WiFi, which he didnt, but I did have data which I was using to communicate and check on my sisters . During this time I was happy, I felt like I had set new goals and I was looking forward to achieving them, but when I got back I have a friend who was currently going through something ( this is a relationship I have wanted to end for a while but again I felt guilty because I felt like I was the only person she had to talk to but I always felt that the relationship was one sided because of a lot of snarky comments, lies and a lack of interest in my life on her end). I got back and I tried to contact her to see how she was doing and she was seemingly mad at me for not calling or checking up on her even though I did say i would not be connected to Wifi. The whole situation triggered a lot of feelings and made me realize that I keep going back to the same friends who I wanted to be done with, but whenever I try guilt keeps up in my mind and makes me feel like I should be having friends and I cannot cut everyone off. But I just honestly have so so much going on right now, I live in a toxic home with toxic parents and right now Im just trying to sort out my own childhood trauma and also be there for my sisters when they are also going through stuff etc .

username#01082,post,2020-09-11 18:06,I [29F] got in an argument with my husband [33M] over fried eggs.,"I was cooking breakfast for dinner yesterday. I had the eggs out ready to make scrambled eggs which is what our daughter and I like. My husband walks in and asks can you make me fried eggs please thats what I want. I told him I didnt make those often at all because I dont really know how. He says yes you can, you can do it then walks out of the room. So here I was trying to make these stupid fried eggs and obviously failing miserably at it. My husband walks back in the room, looks at the fried eggs and asked what are those? Why did you cook them like that? Here, let me show you how to do it.  

I was already upset that I couldnt make the eggs properly, on top of not wanting to make eggs like this in the first place. I felt like my husband had a tone with how he questioned me over the eggs and it made me mad. When he offered help to make fried eggs the way he does it, I snapped back and said no, I do not want to learn how to make them, just cook whatever you want. and I walked out of the room. 

He came in there and asked what my deal was and I told him I didnt like the way he interrogated me over those damn eggs. He said all he was doing was offering to help show me how to make them. I told him I didnt appreciate the tone in his voice and I felt that he should be grateful that I even attempted to make them. So now I am upset because of the way he came at me, and hes upset because of the attitude that I threw back at him. I feel like this is a lose lose situation.

I understand how ridiculous this all sounds. Currently deciding if I should apologize or just not mention it and move on. Its eggs.",relationship_advice

username#01091,post,2022-03-03 08:59,Help me settle an argument pls,"My brother and I went to an advanced screening of the Batman today. At the end of the movie, with the lights back on, silent screen, and at least 80% of the people in the movie theater talking, I began to tell him my thoughts. I personally loved the movie so I was so excited to tell him about it. I get 3-4 words in when he says youre so loud, lower your voice. He said this with a tone/attitude and I wasnt having it so I told him fine, I wont say anything. What did you think? He doesnt answer my question and thus, begins a 2 hour argument. 

His side: 

1) the people in the row behind us werent talking and were able to hear what I was saying 
2) being the center of attention makes him uncomfortable and me speaking at that noise level in a movie theater caused him to be the center of attention 
3) I was inconsiderate of his feelings by not whispering

My side:
1) I was speaking at a normal indoor voice (possibly a little louder because I was excited about the movie)
2) 80% of the entire movie theater was also talking at a normal indoor voice
3) I completely understand telling me to quiet down if Im in a library, at church, during a movie, or during a lecture of some sort. However, the movie was done, the lights were on, and no one was trying to get the attention of the crowd.

I am aware that this argument seems a little immature and whatnot but pleeeaasseee help me settle it.",relationship_advice

username#00736,comment,2024-09-19 20:30,,"There are a few tiny weird similarities to Flowers in the Attic and Heaven which are books written by VC Andrews in the 80s. 

Spoilers ahead for FITA: If the incest thing is true, especially with people saying they're half siblings, who produced 4 children in this order: son, daughter, boy girl twins, that's exactly what happens in Flowers in the Attic. If Cat is short for Cathy or Catherine, that's the oldest daughter's name in FITA as well, and the ages of the children are very similar. The half siblings in FITA share a mother, but the father of the female half sibling has heart disease and suffers from a heart attack when she marries her half brother (who she doesn't know is her half brother, but her father does). Tom and Luke are names from VCA's book Heaven which also has incestuous themes (as do most of her books). This could easily all be coincidence but it's one of the first things I noticed.",offmychest

Heres something I would suggest. I love on the outskirts of a smaller city. In the downtown area of that city is a creative space where they have book clubs, open mics, music, and art on alternating days of the week. Ive been there several times and have seen many people just congregating and getting to know one another. Perhaps see if your city/town/village has something comparable. Lots of outgoing people into lots of different things and always willing to talk. 

If you are shy, I understand that. I am as well. Through my career and hanging out in that area with my wife for some time now, I would suggest try being outgoing. Strike up a conversation. If it goes nowhere, youve lost nothing. If you dont talk to people, then you lose the opportunity. This of course is easier said than done, but in practice works. And if you feel embarrassed after an encounter you can take comfort in knowing the likelihood of that person remembering the situation or even talking to or meeting them again are very slim. 

This is a very specific response to a general question but I hope this helps and hope you are well.

On Saturday I was driving home and saw a turtle in a busy road. I pulled over and went to help it, but it had already been run over by a car and was badly injured. Very badly. I dont want to describe what it looked like because it was gruesome and terrible. I move it out of the street and then called animal control- they said they would put in a report. I couldnt stand to see the turtle in the condition it was in- it was writhing and suffering. I ended up leaving the scene and going home and cried for quite a while. Then it occurred to me that if I hadnt moved it out of the street, it probably would have been hit by a car again and put out of its misery quicker. But with how I left it, who knows how long it will suffer before it can die. I just cant stop thinking about it- how much the animal was suffering. 
I called animal control for an update and they said that they went to the scene, but could not find the turtle. So I dont know what happened to it. I think I have ptsd from the incident, and I dont know how to get some closure on it.",offmychest

I could almost get over that, but she kept speaking to him. She said she still loves me, but she got things from him she didn't believe she was getting from her relationship with me. But I'm too tired to try to untangle the lies. Everything sounded disingenuous after a while.",offmychest
username#01053,post,2019-07-06 03:56,"I'm trying to be reasonable/rational, but I'm afraid my girlfriend of 7 years doesn't love me anymore","I don't even know if this is the place to say this, but I just need to talk about it, and maybe someone can help.

So I've been with this girl since 2011. This had been since we were teenagers, and as far as I know, we were each other's first. We've been relatively active sexually, and generally nothing has been a problem, that I'm aware of. She's shy about talking about sex, but I thought we were relatively open with each other, and I always tried to make sure i wasn't doing things she didn't like.

Actual intercourse was something we didn't do frequently, on account of not living together/having the opportunity to be uninterrupted. We moved in together late last year because she lost her living arrangements, and I thought that the sex thing would change, and we'd get more frequent and have a chance to really be intimate. But she became uninterested, and we only occasionally had sex.

Then around February, it just stopped. When I try to initiate, she basically tells me to stop, though in not so many words, so I do. I try to give her some space. I ask if there's something I did, or if something's wrong, if I can do anything for her, if she needs to talk about something. She says I didn't do anything wrong, and eventually her reason was depression.

I tried to help how I could, to help her change her circumstances, since the depression seemed to be job related and due to her not being able to spend time on her hobbies. She never changed jobs, because she couldn't find one that sounded good enough to her, and she has a whole space for her hobby now that she doesn't use. She usually just sleeps.

I eventually tried to get her to see someone, but she wouldn't go because she doesn't have insurance, and there are no free clinics around. I can't afford it either, so there's not much else I can do there.

At this point she pretty much shows me no affection, and either doesn't respond or denies my affection, even in a non-sexual context of things like hand holding or kissing. I've asked if I'm the problem, she says no. She says she still loves me. I've asked all kinds of other questions along the lines of ""how can I help"" or ""what do you need,"" and she just says ""I don't know,"" like a dodge.

At this point for me, I don't think it's really about the sex. I feel like an entitled ass for getting frustrated over that. But it's really just the fact that I haven't gotten any real behavior out of her, beyond words, in the past 4 months that indicates she still loves me, and it's fucking me up inside.

Another thing that makes me feel like an ass is that I'm mentally questioning her depression explanation, because she goes out with friends and does things pretty often, and seems to have a good time like nothing's wrong. I don't know if it's fair of me or not to be bothered by or jealous of that.

When I really press her on it, she says maybe she's asexual, and again, I feel like an ass for having a problem with that, because she sure acted like she was into sex for the first seven-ish years. And I'm not an expert on sexuality but I don't think that explains the change in non-sexual affectionate behavior

I just can't help but feel like I'm totally wrong and I'm just a huge ass for not being cool with it all and being 100% supportive, but I feel like she doesn't love me anymore, and just won't say it. Like I said, I've tried to have a conversation about it, but it always ends up in ""it's depression, I can't help it"" or ""maybe I'm asexual.""

I don't know how I'm supposed to handle this. I don't know how to get out of the loop, and the way she breaks down every time makes me feel like shit for bringing it up. I've gone through so much anxiety and self-image/self-esteem issues over this. I'm so tired.

I talked to him 24 hours ago. He was supposed to come over to my house and help me with my flower bed. He never showed up. Never called. Thats very unlike him to do. I tried not to worry too much and went about my day. Now here we are 24 hours later and I still havent heard anything from him. Ive tried calling him, no answer. He couldve fell ill and is resting or his back could have went out, I just dont know or maybe the heat. But now Im starting to get really scared.

I just needed to vent.

Im from a smaller metropolitan area in the Midwest that is still relatively progressive, but much more traditional. Semi recently (4ish months), I had a long term relationship end, and the healing process has not been as kind to me at times as I wish it was. I have an okay, but strained relationship with my family, so I knew the holidays would be stressful, but I didnt expect anything crazy to be said. 

In the span of like 3 hours, an extremely close family friend asked if I was seeing anyone, and when I said no, this man deadass looked at me and said, man. You really better, youre not getting any younger (I honestly think my first response was laughter because I could not believe this was a thing being said to me in the year of our lord 2018), my mom made some passive aggressive dig about how she wasnt holding her breath for grandchildren, which I know wasnt meant to be hurtful, but it is now that Im freshly out of what I expected to be a forever relationship, and everyone kept referring to me being single/the breakup as my situation. Idk if maybe Im just used to the friends and community I keep in my city of residence, and thats why this all feels so shocking, but I straight up cannot believe that those things were said to me.

I am so stupid and I feel such guilt.

username#01088,post,2020-10-14 23:16,I made the worst mistake of my life... (long),"

I watched a TikTok/saw a tweet cant remember about an easy way to make money- livestream on this app and talk to guys, (it can be strictly platonic) make a private group and sell it using cashapp. My friends and I did it, sort of as a joke. We did act like flirty, drunk idiots as thats what we were. 

So yeah, we did it, made a little money (I was glad to pay for some textbooks) and suffice to say some guys were pissed (only like 10 paid for it or so, not a lot) and wanted more than just chatting. We felt bad so we made private snaps and added them, to talk to them and they were okay with that- I think they were just lonely. (If they sent explicit pictures, they were blocked.) This happened in the span of a week and we were done.

Stupidly, I started talking to one of the guys from snap. He sent pictures of himself, told me things about himself, we video chatted, and became friendly but it was clear it was romantic (at least I felt that way.) After talking for two weeks, things changed. We discussed maybe even meeting up. (Honestly not sure if I wouldve done that..but maybe, no different from meeting someone on Bumble?) Everything was done under a false name. 

He sent explicit pictures, videos, did a livestream with him actually like finishing (I just watched) and I just trusted him.
I sent some pictures of my boobs, ass (in thong) and some photoshopped nudes (too scared to send real thing so just edited over thong, it did look real though but my boobs were real, I think I did send one real nude nothing very explicit/high quality) I sent flirty, semi-explicit pictures/videos. And I did a livestream for him, showed my boobs but I was in a thong. Everything was going fine... until he wanted more, Like of me touching myself and I was uncomfortable with that (Im very prude, so I initially thought this whole thing with him would be a good way I get in touch with my sexuality) I refused and he was absolutely livid, he changed immediately.

He then said my real name, address, my Facebook, relatives/friends Facebook, and told me he was going to send the pictures/videos to them. I was devastated and begged him not to. 

He said if I sent him $10,000 he would delete them. Obviously I cant afford that. He said if I go to the police, he has foreign ties (Eastern Europe I think, he had an accent) and ties to the dark web, and they would send them/post them like a dead mans switch. 

He said that there was another way. He wanted me to promote the private groups on the live-streaming app, and do the private groups.. explicitly.. I was horrified. But I thought it was the only way. He said other threats too but I dont even want to talk about that.

So I promoted them, acting kind of flirty/slutty(like he said) and people paid for them. I was to send him half of the money and then tips from the group.

So I did the private group but I would only be topless. I told him I would rather kill myself then show/do anything further. 

I did the group like this 3-4 times. And sent him half the money. It wasnt a massive amount, but pretty good for doing nothing but blackmailing someone.

This private group thing happened and ended in the span of a week. Nobody wanted to pay just to see boobs I guess. 

Again he was furious and said to promote it saying I would go all the way. I told him again I would kill myself. He told me to create an Onlyfans instead then and give him access and he wanted access to the Snapchat. After a few days I did just that. 
We agreed I would only post feet pictures and thats it.
I promoted that, like he said. People said it was not worth it and that it was like an ig account on the chat. Maybe he saw that and got mad, but when I logged in one day, I was shocked to find he posted and sent in the PPV messages, those private pictures, videos, and the recorded livestream(edited with different audio) and he was chatting with these men (even giving them rates...) I realized he was doing that on my Snapchat too.

I have never felt so vulnerable and exposed in my life. I wept and furiously attempted to delete the Onlyfans, and it said it had to wait to be deleted until the last person who subbed, subscription ends. Thankfully most people didnt resub (cause it was kind of a terrible onlyfans tbh) and I just blocked the last two guys and it set for the process of deletion. I deleted the live-streaming app, and I messaged him saying I was going to the police for blackmail and extortion, there was the records of sending the money on cashapp, and I spoke to a lawyer family friend...

He basically said okay fine, goodbye. 
I deleted the Snapchat. 
And that was it. I stopped eating for awhile and lost a lot of weight. I threw myself into my studies. 
Everyday I am afraid of him / stumbling across those pictures/videos... its crazy how this all happened over the course of 5 weeks, I speak to a therapist about it and I am healing. 

The shame is the worst part of it all. I feel sick at what others may think of me... men especially as I want to get married and start a family.
I am a very open and honest person, and would feel the need to tell someone I was dating after a little bit about this.

When my boyfriend and I met, I thought he was a really sweet guy. He was funny, good looking, and genuinely a nice person. Eventually our friendship would turn into two years of dating. 

But I never felt incredibly excited when we did. I never had those butterflies I had with other guys, I wasnt head over heels or waiting for his every text. Ive never had a serious long term relationship before, so I told myself this is how mature people fall in love. I wanted so badly to have a boyfriend, to feel what its like to love and be loved. 

Throughout our two years dating, we had a lot of fun times. We traveled within the states, hung out with friends, went out to concerts and festivals and restaurants. And he turned into my best friend. But there was always something missing. 

Our sex life wasnt bad. But it wasnt entirely earth shattering either. It was just okay. He was incredibly socially awkward and he always made me order our food at restaurants or so anything that involved talking to other people. He didnt fit in with with my group of friends, and I would constantly have to explain to them why he was always so quiet. I, on the other hand am extremely outgoing so this bothered me a lot. 

I began to see that were really incompatible in many other ways but I would let it go because he loved me. I would look at other guys and see the traits I wish I had in a guy and say I wish he had that. And I felt horrible for it. But I would tell myself do you know how hard it is to find someone whos smart and loyal and who loves unconditionally? So I would just ignore my feelings. 

And then finally, when he brought up marriage, I said to myself he would make a good dad. I knew I wasnt in love with him. But I knew he would make a good husband and father. And so I began to settle.

We planned the house we would buy, how we would raise our kids, our finances, etc. During this time, I had a gut feeling that this wasnt meant to be. It was horrible but I kept it to myself. I never told a single friend about it. 

One day, I was having lunch with my mom, and she told me she could sense that I was on the fence. And I just broke down crying. I told her how I felt. And she told me I had to end it for my sake and for his. 

So I did. I told him I wasnt in love with him and that he deserved someone who was head over heals for him. I told him he deserved someone who worshipped the ground he walked on, because he really did. He was the sweetest person I know, my best friend in every sense of the word. I cried and he cried but ultimately he said he wanted me to be happy. And I wanted the same for him, truly.

I feel like a horrible person for not having told him earlier, for not having the courage to. I was afraid of starting over, of being alone, of never finding love. But I deserve to find love and so does he. 

Im always going to miss our showers together and how he used to clean behind my ears for me and kiss me on the forehead. Ill miss laying down naked on sundays playing video games and watching movies. Ill miss our long drives to other states and our restaurant adventures. Ill miss how he would warm up the towel for me while I showered so I would be warm when I got out.


But Im happy hell find true, mutual love. And hopefully one day I will too.


If youre in a relationship with someone you dont love, please find the courage to find someone you DO love. Your SO deserves it and so do you. Life is short.

Soo many perspectives here.. 

She could be using the jokes to cope with the situation and maybe trying to smooth over the awkwardness. 
Depending on their general closeness prior to the occurrence could determine the level of dark humor used but if they weren't close before,  it's a bit suspicious.

BUT she is a child, a minor. If she has always called before coming over,  why would she deviate? If she is being vocal about it,  imagine what she is saying at school? Or to friends?  

 What if she has a friend with her next time?And then if a parent hears about it.. and then boom a whole big problem.

But this time it really feels like Im having to do it alone. And when that thought comes in I start thinking whats the point. Nobody would even be affected if I did anything. They would feel sad for a little bit maybe. But ultimately the world would keep turning as it should. What a lonely feeling. What a sad feeling. I hate that I cant really talk about this. It comes and goes in waves but I know it would affect my job. It would probably change how people look at me. I just want the feeling to go away. I want to be better again.

Ive hoarded the plates and utensils for a good 7 months since I was let go from my suicide watch. To be honest, I was planning to commit suicide around January or February of next year and being asked to move out if things dont change works in my favor towards suicide. I still have a debt to pay, and a few other things to do before anything so when it comes to my debts. I keep my promise to pay them off (if you loaners from borrow happen to read this).

Im not angry or sad that I may be homeless within a month if my depression and room doesnt get better. Im more anxious on my final decision of what I want to do. Do I continue to try and live my life and struggle with the pain, or just end it all. I know people dont want me to die, but theyre not in my shoes. I dont have a family, Im working 2 jobs with barely a day off, I dont have a significant other and at this point. I long for a relationship, but Im in no place to care for someone else, and yet Im longing for love, longing for help from someone on a deep interpersonal level. Im burnt out, stressed out, and back to my depressive roots that Ive been trying to fight. Im not looking for advice or help, because the answer that Im looking for can only come from myself. Life is shit, and the only answer we can give each other is to remain optimistic, and hope for a better tomorrow while working hard for it.

Im not angry at the world or anybody else. If anyone reads this. I really do hope you can get through your struggles and have a better tomorrow. I also hope your day or night will get better if youre having a shitty one.",offmychest

username#00844,post,2023-03-23 07:17,Captive minecraft 1.19.x ideas,"Hello, what mods/modpacks would you recommend to use in a captive minecraft playthrough? Top priority would be to make it a very challenging playthrough with enough variety to go around due to the restricted world border, wether that be new mobs or items without making it overtly grindy or annoying to progress like some mods tend to do. As far as the ""captive"" part goes, since the original mod is only 1.11, i will be using a different version/map that works on the same principle. On top of that, any mods that can make any of the dimension's resources even somewhat renewable but still challenging to get going are welcome too, as well as mods that add a new dimension, although that will most likely have very limted/niche use case in my world, but time will tell. As of right now i have i few bigger mods in mind, but nothing too game changing as i would like. Hopefully all of this makes sense of what i am trying to achieve. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Edit: If need arises switching to 1.18.x is totally possible.",Minecraft

For the math you can input 2 redstone signals (1 in the back and 1 in the side) and it will add them together (up to 15) and send the signal out the front. You can also right click it to change it to subtract the two signals. With measuring how full containers are, you need to place it so that the back end is either touching the container or is touching a block touching the container. It will give an output based on how full it is 15 being full and 0 being empty",Minecraft

Before even talking about their military... Without the tens of billions of dollars and tens of millions of tons of food, communications equipment, ammo, weapons, support vehicles, railroad equipment, tanks, and warships the US supplied to the Allies as a whole, and to the USSR in particular, the war would have led to a far different outcome. Many Soviet historians, and even Khrushchev and Stalin themselves, have said that that they could not have won without the vital support the US provided them.

I mean, 30% of the entire USSR Air Force was US provided (almost 20 thousand air craft alone). Half of all their agricultural production was destroyed, but the US was dropping them millions on millions of tons of food. A third of their entire support vehicle fleet was US provided, plus almost 2000 trains. Like, the magnitude of this can not be overstated.

Germany's submarines are good, but absolutely not the ""most advanced,"" especially not when compared to the US Virginia, Ohio, and Seawolf class submarines, or even the UK Astute submarine, which is an incredible achievement. 

I would say the same about the Leopard 2A6. A good tank on paper, but not the world's most advanced. It has 100ms higher muzzle velocity than the M1A2 Abrams, but still doesn't match the Abrams in penetrating power because of the actual shell. The Abrams uses DU rounds that offer incredible penetration, while the Leopard must use Tungsten rounds because of environmental regulations. It has a slightly lower top speed than the turbine-powered Abrams, and doesn't have the same degree of armor protection. The greatest power of a tank though, is the crew, and I'd say the Americans have the most experienced tank crews in the world, because they can't seem to keep their asses out of a war every chance they get.

The Leopard is a great tank, though, with the benefit of being so widely used that there will always be a surplus of spare parts for repair and rearming.",worldnews

username#01196,comment,2020-05-30 19:30,,"I had to go through my drive to find old articles I saved about this. It would be great if someone chimed in if any information is wrong or misleading.

From what I understand about Japanese culture, saving, losing, or giving face (*mentsu wo tamotsu)* is closely linked to avoiding shame. It's an extremely important concept in this culture. Another important concept is *tatemae,* or saying what you want your listener wants to hear.

The belief is that many will go to great lengths to save face - [sometimes even telling lies to protect themselves]( I've read [papers]( that talked about the [Japanese justice system]( and how it's much easier to get off with a less severe sentence if you admit guilt even though innocent (the prosecutors way of saving face from a faulty accusation). There was also the case of WWII and the Japanese Empire lying about the treatment of [American prisoners of war.]( There was lying about war-time medical experimentation. Even larger corporations (like all other countries) are guilty of lying to save face and avoid shame.

I had a trip planned with my girlfriend to go to Japan and one of the things my Japanese-native friend had told me was the importance of saving face and the experiences I could encounter with locals once over there.

Filipinos have another term *hiya* or shame. Koreans have their own term as well.

I'm Filipino and I've seen these concepts in practice many times. Aunties and Uncles saying ""Yes"" to avoid the shame that comes with hurting someone's feelings. I've lived with Korean friends and family who share similar experiences.

It's been tough as I was born in America and I now work a corporate job, so the idea of saving face always seemed foreign to me. Why would I tell a white-lie when I can get straight to the point? Who cares in the work place?

I'm definitely not condoning the behavior of the Chinese government. They've done terrible things and need serious reform (as does ours). However, when we look at the decisions they make through a lens of saving face and ""trying to look good to others,"" it becomes easier to find a reason why they do certain things. Saving face is a dominant concept in many Asian cultures. 

It is definitely one of the elements belonging in the East vs. West mentality.",worldnews

Backstory: For the last 10 years or so there was a small group of us on Xbox, and end of last year a few of us moved onto Discord and made a bigger group. As it stands, including me, theres 5/6 on xbox, and 15 on Discord. The Xbox group play every day, and the Discord group once or twice a week or so.

Onto the story: One of the guys from the xbox group and I do not get along. He basically treats me like  a piece of shit 99% of the time. Hes openly said to me that he doesnt value me or my opinions, and has told me to kill myself. He has never once taken responsibility for his actions, and never apologized to me for anything. He is a piece of shit. But its been 10 years, I should be used to this right.

Anyway, other night we're all on Discord, and a minor argument starts. He starts it, gets angry at me, leaves the group, blocks me, refuses to talk to anyone, usual childish bullshit. This would be absolutely fine if it wernt for the fact that everyone else in the group starts blaming me for this argument. Im the one thats kicked off, I need to apologise, blah blah blah. THIS is the catalyst which has snapped me, and made me realize just what a manipulative sociopath this guy is. How he's very easily managed to get people angry at me for something that HE did.

But it gets worse.

One of the group, who wasnt around for the argument, messages me the next day, and rips into me over this. Calls me a child, Im pathetic, I need to grow up. I asked what HE had told them. The basis of their conversation (of which I have screenshots) is that HE got angry, left everything, and its my fault. When confronted about his overreaction, his response was ""Excuse you? If you try to put this on me im going to flip"". So, very clearly this means it MUST be my fault, and I deserve these messages. I lost it, and told them exact who HE is, exactly what HE does, how HE behaves, the full truth. The response? ""I really couldn't care if he's putting on a mask. He's coming across as a nice person. Whether that's the real him or not I don't care. I don't care if this is because of last night. Or because of 10 years worth of feelings you've bottled up. You need to apologize, talk to him about this, and get over it.""

So already Im feeling gaslighted to fuck, but it gets even worse.

We move onto Xbox, today, and im asked by one of that group (who isnt in the Discord) what happened. I explain, and give the same full truth. Response: ""I know. Believe me, we all know. But you know full well we cant do a thing about it"" and off they all went.

So thats it. Im done. Thats all my friends gone. They made their choice, knowing that a manipulative sociopath has outcasted someone from the group. I cant go back to it, because I KNOW its more than ""just banter"". He genuinely sees me as sub-human, and everyone else in both groups is completely fine with that.

This is my life guys. I fucking *love* it!

username#00872,post,2023-06-14 15:10,"My grandfather died a sad death, and I wasn't as sad as I should've been","This story begins around 2-3 years ago, when my grandfather started complaining about pain in his stomach. At the time, my entire family thought it was just normal stomach problems caused by the food he was eating, like his stomach not being able to handle his diet. However, after a few weeks passed, my family decided to take grandpa to the doctor. My uncle decided on an expensive hospital, completely paid by my family, as this would get us a better, quicker diagnosis. In hindsight, it should have been important that my grandpa's diagnosis came back after just a short consultation, but the doctor that gave it was well-known, and he seemed confident that my grandpa had appendicitis. For the next 2 months, my family dealt with my grandpa's operation and recovery. We were all surprised that even though my grandpa had never been admitted to a hospital, let alone gone into surgery, he dealt with it extremely well. With the medication he was given, my grandpa felt better for a while.
But then the pain came back, and it was far worse. The situation reached a boiling point when my grandma called my parents, on the verge of tears, saying that my grandpa had to go back to the hospital, since he was doing horribly. He could barely eat, and the pain made sleeping almost impossible, resulting in him looking pale, and losing a ton of weight (that's what we thought caused it at the time). This time, my mom opted to have grandpa sent to a public hospital, as she had lost faith in the private hospital from before, but this would lead to other issues. This whole ordeal happened during covid, so most hospitals were full of covid pacients. My grandpa was dropped off at the hospital, with a new cell phone so he could keep in touch with us (up until then, he didn't see the importance of having a personal phone, and preferred to tell my grandma things, and having her pass it on). 
Long story short, grandpa spent 8 hours sitting in the hospital waiting room, since the nurses claimed there were no beds available. However, one of my uncle's friends happened to be a nurse, and would later say all covid pacients from that hospital were sent to the hospital she worked at due to better conditions, meaning that at the time the hospital was almost empty. Who know why they didn't let my grandpa into a bed. What matters is that they didn't. Later, after more thorough tests, we'd find out that my grandpa had colon cancer. For treatment, part of his colon had to be removed.
 Unlike with the appendicitis, my grandpa was mortified to hear the new diagnosis. I'd later come to find out that both of my grandpa's parents, as well as his siblings had died of some form of cancer, and he was the only one still alive. I didn't get to speak with him on the phone, the only time my grandma planned to pass me her phone he was approached by a nurse, and had to hang up, but from what I saw of my family's reactions speaking with him, he was scared. I'd never heard of my grandpa being scared, I'd always known him as a cold, badass old man that cussed out anything that pissed him off, but was always warm and joking around when talking to me. Hell, for the longest time I thought be had been a soldier, since he had the tendency to salute in old photos. Nope, turns out, he worked as a well-known geography teacher in the area, that would bike 10 miles both ways to work every day, for around 40 years. Maybe now he was scared because he knew cancer had taken his parents and siblings, and had now come to take him too. The last time I saw him in person was some time before he left for the hospital, when he remarked to a guest he was having that it's nice to have his grandson visit. Although I'd spend a lot of time at my grandparents house when I was little, I mostly stopped visiting around when I was in middle school. I had thought that maybe he didn't want me coming over every weekend, but maybe he had actually missed me. And while he was recovering from surgery I didn't do as much as to call him.
One day, while I was gaming in my room, my mom quietly opened the door and came, which, when compared to how she usually barges in, was weird. She just walked up to me, still holding her phone after talking to the hospital, and simply said that grandpa had died. She teared up as my expression changed, and left to cry without me seeing her, without saying anything else. I sat there confused for quite some time, as I'd thought his recovery was going well, but in the end, I couldn't cry. I just couldn't. I remembered a video of grandpa holding me as a toddler, I felt sad, but I just couldn't cry. I didn't know how interesting of a person grandpa was until then, I only knew him as grandpa. The things about him I wrote here were mostly told to me by my grandma while she was reminiscing. I couldn't even get any tears flowing at his funeral. Up until then, me and my grandma would make jokes about how he always slept after meals, or how he would slightly burn barbeques, but after his death grandma only spoke of him in positives, bringing up all the nice things he did.
I feel as if I'd never given him the attention he deserved, and being a little kid shouldn't have stopped me. When I turned 18, my grandma started crying as she hugged me, and said that grandpa would've loved to see me all grown up.

Initially, I planned for this story to be about how the healthcare system failed my grandpa, and how doctors during the pandemic aren't the heroes they're claimed to be, but as I went on my tangent I realiesd that this became about something else entirely. I'm sorry for having wasted your time with this long post, but I feel like it should be here. If this post feels familiar, it's because I'd posted it before around two years ago, putting the blame on hospital staff, but as I calmed down and as I got more and more hate for it I decided to take it down (it was only up for less than an hour, so really I would've probably been chased off the internet had I left it up, especially during the pandemic). Feel free to ask for details or say what you think, I'll try my best to read all of the comments and respond where I have to. Thanks a lot.",TrueOffMyChest
username#00872,post,2022-10-21 20:55,I'm lonely.,"It's been normal for 17 years, but I'm turning 18 in a couple months and I'm starting to feel like I'm going to be stuck by myself forever. I keep seeing the people around me finding groups to stay with, people to connect with and even partners, meanwhile I feel like even though I have a group of friends, I'm not really that close to them. We don't hang out outside of school, I feel like they keep me around mainly so I help them out with school work and any plans we've had to spend time together have fallen through. It feels like I'm being ignored, or that they simply don't want me around. I can't even talk to people without the feeling that they're mocking me, or treating me like a child. I just want someone to make me feel important, but that's too much to ask for.",TrueOffMyChest
username#00872,post,2022-08-21 00:03,"An old friend ""reunited"" with me just to steal from me.","Back in the seventh grade, I was good friends with this guy, I'll call him S. We had fun, and sometimes even hanged out outside of school. Of course, it eventually fizzled out as we got to high school. I prioritized my studies and new friends and he dropped out to work in construction out of town; until about a month ago, when we randomly bumped into each other in a park, and he invited me to his birthday party. In my country, it's normal to hold a party with tons of alcohol when you turn 18 (the legal drinking age here). It didn't seem off, we were pretty close, maybe he just wanted to catch up. I ended up getting him an expensive glass bottle and cup set as a gift. The party was pretty underwhelming. It was really just me, him and two of his cousins. We got pretty drunk, which my parents wouldn't approve of, so I spent around an hour and a half on my phone until I sobered up, and went home.

Two days later, we were playing soccer in the park, and I left my phone in a grassy corner as I had small pockets and didn't want it to fall out and break. When we finished up I went to get my phone just to discover that it was gone. I told that guys, and S suggested that everyone show their pockets. Everyone showed their pockets, and we left. On my way home I got a weird feeling that I should go back to the park and keep looking around. It just so happened that while I was looking around I saw S run behind the park toilets, then turn back towards the park exit. Earlier, he had went to ""pee"" in the grassy corner where my phone was, afterwards going to the toilets. Strike one. When he went back to the toilets I saw him putting something into his pocket. Strike two. He said he came back to look for his soccer ball, even though his ball had never been near the toilets. Strike three. When we left together he showed me his pockets again, except this time he didn't show his back pocket. Strike four. While I was near him my smartwatch was indicating that it was connected to my phone (it connects  automatically when close enough). Strike five. He knew it was expensive, still new, a month out of the box, so he had a reason. Strike six.

At this point it was obvious that he took it, but I still didn't confront him. I didn't want to believe it. I didn't want to accuse him. I had known the guy for almost 6 years, I thought he wouldn't do this to me. How do you believe someone could steal from you just two days after you went to their birthday party? Because I was so much of a pushover, I had to spend an entire week talking to police and asking around. My mom eventually came across him mom, told her about my suspicions, and she got S to confess, but by this point he had already had my phone wiped and sold it to a pawn shop.

 I'm currently holding my phone, typing this out, but it feels different. I got this phone as a reward for passing exams, and spent a month personalizing it. After a two-week trip it felt like it was truly mine, and now it's lost. Knowing that all the pictures and apps I had were wiped makes everything feel foreign. Like memories that were washed away just because someone wanted to make a quick buck. I feel like I have to wash my hands after typing this. I have to wonder if he only invited me to his party to get me drunk and rob me. I wish I had shoved my hand in his pocket and got my phone back. My proper phone, the one that was taken from me. I hate that I was such a pussy I couldn't confront a guy even with all the proof I needed dangling in front of me. After being stabbed in the back like this I'm done.

I'm sorry for dumping this dumpster fire of a story on you, but I really need to get it off my chest. I believe it's my fault I left my phone behind, but at the same time how should I have known? I'm tired of people I think I know betraying me.",TrueOffMyChest

Here's what likely happened: she likely disregarded his hints at not wanting more at some point and became pushy, and fearing he couldn't do anything to convince her otherwise, but yet loving her, he felt trapped , and just evaded the dilemma by essentially castrating himself.
You could actually say that is a sacrifice he made to himself not upset their family union.

You have to keep in mind that reddit users while writing a post in frustration are rarely objective. There is a likelihood that she left out part of the story to gain sympathy from us.
The reality of the matter is likely not entirely how it portrayed here.

Every decision I made was meticulously made with the intention of the outcome benefiting those around me more than it did me. This year, however, I turned this mindset around. While I still care about what happens to those around me, I no longer base my life on these risks. Just a little over 6 months ago, I would've been bedridden with guilt over the decisions I've made in the last few weeks. Bedridden with guilt because they didn't benefit my parents, brother, friends, or romances before they benefited me. I'm currently living in my own apartment in Barcelona, my favorite place in the world. I'm doing whatever the heck I want with my money, my romantic life, my friendships, my career. I'm not the person I was last year. I'm not that girl anymore. Any other year of my life, this thought would've terrified me. But I'm proud of myself. It only took 27 years, but I did it; I'm free and am finally my own person.",TrueOffMyChest

Late last night, I came to the realization that love is real but it is not for me. I reflected on my past, my present, and my future and came to conclude many things. I dont know if undeserving is the right word but I feel undeserving of true love. I have been and continue to be the stepping stone guys take to find better things/better people in life. Im the person they date to realize that they could do better and have better lives. Craziest part is that this is actually a calming realization.

Im turning 25 this year but grew up in a super dysfunctional family, making my mom leave when I was 13 and I never continued to hold a bond with her after she left. I always had fights with my dad so I basically grew up alone and independent. Decided to move out at 19 or 20 years old (dont remember tbh, its been 5 or so years on my own but it feels like Im in my thirties). Cant go to school since I dropped out of community college with Ws so I cant apply for financial aid anymore, and Im basically working as a barista (which I love) but Ive basically been stuck in the same loop for the past 10 years. Nothing is getting better for me. The fear of being homeless, the fear of never going anywhere, and the fear of being alone. Everything has made me depressed and suicidal, which Ive almost done back in 2020 due to a ton of stress piling up. Ive grown a lot, and become a whole lot mature than before, but Im tired of everything as well. The stress, the loneliness, the depression (which Ive learned is all environmental after taking antidepressants for a few months). I know everything takes a toll on you, and you basically become numb to it all. Sometimes I find beauty in the world through random things like hikes and just being in tune to nature.

Ive questioned if I can really make it by being alone. I have great friends and theyve helped me through a lot of my pain and bouts of depression, but I dont talk to them as much anymore because I want to see them thrive and continue on into their careers and lives without me. As much as they say they love and care for me. Were all going different paths, and I dont see my path leading anywhere anymore. Maybe you should take a break from social media if you have an IG or a Snapchat. Itll help with the psyche. I havent used social media except for Reddit in years and Im probably going to keep it that way. Also it wouldnt hurt to do things (if possible) outside of your comfort zone and explore new avenues of inspiration. Just taking a step back and observing the world around me gives me minor inspiration for a moment and see the beauty of this world past my pain. However, Im only somewhat versed about and how it affects the mind and social interactions. So take what I say with a grain of salt.

username#01217,post,2021-04-03 06:58,Cest La Vie,"Ive recently put in a one week resignation from one of my jobs only a few weeks of being promoted to a manager position. I was going to quit anyways sooner or later, due to the fatigue of working 2 jobs with a 60+ hour work schedule with no day off. Ive been trying to save up cash in order to actually create a savings, but a former close friend fucked me over with that, other unforeseen circumstances fucked me over, and quitting this job has also fucked me over. Ive just had one shitty year after year, and there really hasnt been much change to anything even though I try and try.

What has really been grinding my gears as of late, are the circumstances as to why I quit. The fact that the new lead manager wouldnt listen with what I had to say, and just disregarded everything and told me Ive been a manager longer than youve been alive. It doesnt matter what you already know it makes me laugh but also pisses me off. Hes been in management for a long time, yet hes only had this job for 2 weeks, and hes already lost an employee that actually works hard, and doesnt need to really be trained for the new position. Youd rather let someone leave that knows how to merchandise already, knows how to change tires, knows the ins and outs of the products and basically everything else in the store. My DM wants to keep me and wants to work things out, but there have been complications already. Such as me calling out sick this last Tuesday because I was getting sick due to fatigue. I work from 9 in the morning to 9:30 at night, maybe even 10. So Im fucking sorry that my body was working against me, and Im sorry that my symptoms resembled a hangover. Yet he didnt want to listen to what I had to say, and just kept bringing up drinking and partying and what I do on my private time is my own, but I shouldnt let that affect work.

All this stress from one job, the stress of being unable to try and be financially secure to setbacks, the stress of having no family and dealing with life on my own, minimal amount of truly supportive friends, and the fact that I still get fucked over year after year of one issue to the next. It makes me want to hate life, it makes my depression and suicidal thoughts worst, it makes me relapse, and yet the only conclusion that I can come up with and try to tell myself that things will get better is just Cest La Vie. Life is cruel and unfair to some, and loving and fair to others. I cant hate a world that has no true bias towards anybody in terms of what youre given.

Maybe this is what I am thinking about?

username#00919,comment,2023-02-14 17:31,,"It's misleading to say ""the black market price of a gun is only $1000"", because the black market is not an open market. To get a gun via the black market, you not only need the money, but also a contact within organized crime who's willing to sell to you.

In countries where guns are illegal, almost all the illegal guns are held by organized crime, not by lone-wolf individuals. 

A gun smuggler has contacts in organized crime they sell to. There isn't an open market for guns. It's all contact-to-contact behind closed doors. Otherwise they'd get caught and shut down. We know from previous investigations and undercover work how much the smugglers charge per gun in these secret sales, but that doesn't mean just anyone can buy the gun at that price. Just anyone isn't invited to these sales.

Even if an individual could contact a gun smuggler the gun smuggler would first suspect they're an undercover cop, and not respond.

Then if an individual could get the gun smuggler to talk to him, the smuggler might also refuse to sell on the basis that if this creepy wacko does a high-profile school shooting with the gun, then the gun might get traced back to the smuggler via the wackjob, and the police will be out for blood. The smuggler doesn't want that trouble. That's why they sell only to known contacts.

The black market exists, but lonely weirdos aren't invited.",interestingasfuck

The guy was well on his way to finish it with the help of his really strong horse.

username#01222,comment,2022-10-24 14:37,,"Thanks for asking.

First, lets establish that such a utopia does not exist, especially in China. There is a large housing crisis, weed is illegal, homelessness is a big problem in many cities, and incarceration, especially of minority groups like Muslims, is a major issue bordering on genocide. Whats more, its  people likely dont know the scope of the issue since the media is heavily controlled and required to filter its content.

Lets also put aside that democracy doesnt mean giving those things up. Many democracies have free healthcare and strong gun laws, places like Japan have great public transport, and the US has fairly good safety nets for the unemployed. I worked hard in the US and was able to go to university for free. Democracies have most of worlds top schools.

The answer to your question as asked is yes, if such a utopia existed (it doesnt) and its benefits were perfect and would always remain that way.

But in practice, absolutely not. Our institutions will fail us. Being able to speak out against (and ultimately vote out) those who govern us is critical for change. If your healthcare fails you, you know you can speak out about it without the government coming to take you away. I wouldnt give that up for anything.

But democracy is much more than being able to speak poorly of the government. Its about not giving the government complete control. In a place like China or North Korea, what if the government decided the internet is now illegal? What recourse do you have? What if they made biracial marriage illegal? What if they decided that /you/ are the problem?

One of my favorite quotes is this: Democracy is the worst form of government..except for all the others that have been tried. History has taught us time and time and time again what happens when you give all control of the peoples lives to a government and  especially an authoritarian leader.

By the way, Chinas president just decided hes going to continue in an unprecedented third term. He will likely decide to stay in power indefinitely.And of course, theres nothing the Chinese people can do about it.",interestingasfuck

Swimming is not a negotiable sport. Everyone who swims at his level knows that you dont go in another lane, and you especially dont sit on the lane line. Swimming is very strict, and it being strict makes the sport extremely predictable. If I was swimming in that race, and I saw those two swimmers in the same lane, it would genuinely distract me because it is so out of place that I would think something was going on. 

He wasnt disqualified because he interfered with the race of the guy next to him, he was disqualified because he was being extremely disrespectful to the people who were still finishing their races. Swimming has a very strong character and culture, it doesnt tolerate excuses. You cant just come in with your cocky attitude, almost break the lane lines, and then expect the rules to bend to you.

I get how it looks from the outside, and under the circumstances I think a very serious warning may have been a better way to go, but it is nowhere near as outlandish as you guys are making it out to be, and he should definitely have known better.",interestingasfuck

I think a lot of people really don't realize how true this is. If we got rid of all the police, then there would be a lot of really important work that suddenly nobody would do anymore. 

After all, without the police who else would be willing to threaten children with deadly weapons? Who else would be able to round up so much free labor to be brought to prisons? I know I'm certainly not going to murder my own dog, so it's nice that the police will do it for me.

The DragonBorn is the DragonBorn. Chosen by prophecy to save the world and stronger than anyone else. Mary Sue.


That's just what these games are like. You're the perfect chosen-one hero and you go on fantastic adventures eat bad guys for breakfast and save everything.

It's expected in this genre that the player character is a Mary Sue. I didn't mind that about Aloy because that's just how this genre goes.

username#01222,comment,2022-08-28 17:10,,"Its survivor bias. Your average indie game is absolutely terrible. Out of the millions being made, the few good ones rise to the top.

The AAA game is an enormously difficult, usually 3D, often open world game requiring tons of effort, money, voice actors, modelers, textures, etc. which is played by millions and picked apart by gamers and reviewers to the last degree.

The complexity and cost of these games means less creative risk, more bugs, more risk of publisher meddling. Due to this, theres less chance of an amazing AAA game being made. Theres also quite a few less of them.

But the average AAA game is still better than most indie games by a wide margin.

You can use the same argument for movies. We live in a world where indie movies get better praise than blockbusters. Well, your average indie movie is terrible, but the few you hear about are the ones who /got/ great praise.

Chess is only partially solved. There are too many combinations for it to currently (or maybe ever) be solved. Chess AI can play perfectly late in the game, once an ""endgame"" has been achieved, but not before that.

We were real close friends, hanging out at my place every night. End of the night i'd walk her back to her place and see her in. One night I get home and she calls me, saying her parents have locked her out and shes gonna be stuck outside for the night. I told her its no problem, she can stay at mine, head back round and i'll set up the spare room. Made up the bed, stuck the heater on, got it ready for her, and brought her in. She said she didnt wanna go to bed and wanted to stay with me for a bit, so we hung out and watched a film and talked. I told her she could head to bed whenever, and she just kept saying she wanted to hang out. When I got into bed, she sat on the floor by it, and both of us were watching the film. Next thing I remember was waking up, and seeing her crashed out on the floor next to my bed. Very quickly rushed to get the heater turned off next door (super bad fire risk), and she woke up not long after and left in a mood.

username#01006,post,2017-05-18 16:49,I am concerned the woman next door is being kept against her will,"My neighbor, a middle aged man, is not a friendly person. He is brusque, rarely says hello, and in the two years I've lived here, I haven't learned anything about him. 

He has two teenagers, a boy and a girl, who go to private school and play basketball in the backyard. As of last summer, they've been allowed to roller skate out front. They also don't say much. Recently the daughter was out front dribbling a basketball. I asked if I could try spinning it on my finger, and she handed it over the fence to me. When she heard her dad coming out, I saw a look of panic on her face as she reached for the ball. Her dad scolded her, saying the ball shouldn't be out front, and it *definitely* shouldn't be in the neighbor's yard. No acknowledgement of me. At that moment I wanted to ask why it's bad for his kids to interact with other people, but I stayed quiet. 

So he's a really strict dad--fine. But the concerning part is his ""wife"". She has Asian features, and I've never heard her speak a word of English. (The husband and kids are white; the kids don't look related to her at all). I rarely see her, but when I do she's working on chores: hanging laundry in the back, carrying groceries in the front. She looks worn down and miserable. The family never show any signs of affection to her. Whenever they make an appearance together, she is trailing them with bags. 

So lately I've been wondering more and more what's going on over there. Why is the dad so unfriendly and secretive? Could the ""wife"" be a live-in servant? Mail-order bride? Or possibly something worse? 

It could be a sad but entirely legal situation. Or it could be one of those stories that when the truth is revealed, people will ask why neighbors didn't intervene. I feel compelled to do something, or call someone, but I'm not sure where to turn.",Advice

username#00983,post,2019-07-31 22:25,Decided to Finally Cut Ties With My Mother. Am I Overreacting?,"My mother is an enigma. After raising me and cultivating my thought process for the first twenty years of my life, I finally decided to stop kneeling down to Lucifer. 

My mother has helped me when I was hungry and couldnt afford to purchase anything to eat. Together with my numerous siblings, we enjoyed countless outings to dinner, theme parks, and a few getaways. To an outsider, we had it all. A few of my family  members would scoff at us anytime we would even express even the slightest grievances. 

Youre spoiled.
Youre ungrateful.
You should be happy she even gave you anything.

Having those phrases hammered into my head time and time again made me forgo saying anything at all and I just took things as they came. The only thing that kept me from killing myself sooner is my pride. The image of a better life that is very so close, yet so far away. 

Growing up, we (My brother and I) were treated like dog shit. We werent allowed to go outside or socialize with our peers. Our daily routine consisted of going to school, cleaning up for hours, then going to bed. If the house wasnt cleaned exactly the way she wanted she beat us until we got it right. She called us ugly, dark, and worthless. I remember watching my brother get beat mercilessly because he missed a spot in the kitchen.y mothers boyfriend at the time had to step in to stop her. I knew how she treated us was wrong, but anytime my siblings and I brought it up to our extended family those same phrases were uttered again-

Youre ungrateful
Youre spoiled
You should be thankful for what she does

Our screams for help fell out deaf ears and we just adjusted. Words were powerless. The amount of times she told me, if you hate your life so much, just kill yourself and start over is unfathomable. My brother is mentally unstable and my sister was suicidal. When my sister made an instagram post stating how she just wanted life to end My family shrugged it off and placed the blame on her and I shamefully joined them. You was either with us or against us. Having any kind of feeling of dread or despair was a sign of weakness. In turn, I shoved my emotions deep inside and became an emotionless do boy. 

I did everything my mother asked me to no matter how ridiculous and if I even thought about denying her request, shell say, but I fed you. I put clothes on your back. I do SOO much for you. Youre being greedy and selfish. Eventually, I always caved in. 

When I finally graduated high school, I thought I could finally wiggle free from under Lucifers boot and applied to a university on the other side of the country. Everything was going well until it was time to fill out the FAFSA. For those of you not familiar with the FAFSA, its the Free application for federal student aid. On the application, it asks various preliminary questions to establish whether youre an independent or dependent student. Since I was a dependent student they required my mothers W2 to calculate my EFC (estimated family contribution).  I tried filing as independent, but my request was denied for various reasons. The main one being that I was still living in my mothers household. 

I reluctantly approach my mother about this and she said,  since youre using my W2, I want exactly half of what you get back. This is NOT free money. These are loans that are in MY name that I have to pay back plus interest once I graduate.  When I inquired about why she believes she was entitled to half of the money I was receiving that was supposed to go towards books, housing, etc. Her response was- Youre using my information, without me you wont get anything. I fed you. I do SOO much for you. Youre being greedy and ungrateful. Of course, I caved in. 

I left for college and avoided contacting my mother for the entire year. I didnt come back home for Christmas or Thanksgiving because I didnt have a home. Thankfully, when I opened up to my college friends about my situation, they happily invited me over to stay with them for Winter break. Of course, good things never last and finally contacted my mother when Spring was drawing to a close and Summer break was about to begin. 

Heres what finally push me over the edge- It was the second year of college, I agreed to her proposal once again because I figured I was left with no other choice. My mother informed me that she was sending me a present in the mail. Which was totally unexpected. It was an American Express credit card in my name. I remember her asking me if she can fix my credit before I left for college. I, of course, initially said no and she was furious. You dont trust me? I do SOO much for you etc... She was the master of manipulation and I reluctantly agreed. Biggest regret in my life so far. She open up multiple accounts attached to my name and racked up over $30,000 in credit card charges. When it was time to fill out the FAFSA for the third year of college and I finally put my foot down about the loan situation, she stopped making payments. I had cops come over to my residence (she kicked me out because of the loan situation) on numerous occasions looking to serve me for court. I tried to dispute the charges, but they denied my claims. When I would occasionally see her (I live with another family member that she sometimes visits) she says its YOUR fault you shouldve gave me the loan. You fucked up.Youre ungrateful. Spoiled.

In conclusion, I took a semester off school to work off some of my bills. I plan on going back in the Spring. Im hoping now that I dont live with her, FAFSA will approve me for independent status. If they dont, I dont know what Ill do. These past few months have been so hard and the only thing thats keeping me going is the thought things will get better, it has to.

TLDR- My mother physically and mentally abused me for years, she racked up over $30,000 in credit card charges in my name, and she demanded I take out loans and give her half.",Advice

I requested to take off 3 days (Thursday-Monday) for an extended weekend as I have been working long hours and some weekends and I just really feel really burnt out and need some mental health time away from my normal surroundings. 

My VP who is also my boss made it clear that he was annoyed I was even thinking about taking time off. He said I just started and he doesnt think its a good idea. He then sent out an email to my team and asked them their opinion on me taking off and how it would impact our project. He worded the email in a way that made it hard for them to disagree with him, mentioning deadlines and tasks that still needed to be done. 


So basically its looking like hes going to deny my days off.

(21F)

A little while ago, my friend and I used to stream on a website and if people wanted to talk to us privately, we would make a private group that cost to get into. 

Anyway so we did this for a little bit (less than a week we just wanted some quick money) the groups were always platonic and some would get pissed as they expected more sexual content which we were not comfortable doing- so we said okay we will make snapchats for these people and talk to them (most were just lonely some would send inappropriate pictures and we would block)

One of the guys I ended up really liking and we started  chatting all the time and sending pictures, video called, and I honestly thought I really like him he told me personal things and showed his ID (now I know was fake) and we would talk about meeting...

Anyway after a week of talking he sent explicit pictures/ videos. I didnt want to be prude and I really liked him, so I sent back some. He did a livestream (he showed everything) and I did one too (just topless in a thong) I just felt so comfortable and trusting..and wanted to be sexy 

He then wanted more and I refused to do that... so he got mad and saved everything to camera roll and told me he recorded the livestream. He said my name and address and had my Facebook somehow... and said he would send the videos to my family / friends unless I did what he said or paid him $10,000

I was devastated, obviously couldnt pay that and wanted to die. 
He wanted me to do the private group with my friend explicitly and ask for tips and send half of them to him.
(He said think of this, all your information is safe, and you make money)
I was horrified and didnt know what to do. I told him I would rather die than do it. 
He said what about just take your top off after reaching a certain limit?
So my friend and I did it. We promoted it and (acted bubbly/flirty overly sexual like he asked) we cried for hours after. We probably did it 3-5 times. 
It stopped being profitable quickly cause no one wanted to pay for that. (There was about 10 viewers, all who I did trust a little cause we talked on Snapchat) 
But of course we were still devastated 

After that stopped earning money, he wanted my snap password. I gave it to him. He wanted me to make an OnlyFans which he had access to. (And promote it) I did that, only agreeing to post feet pictures, but he posted my nudes and some of my live-streams on there to sell. I believe he also sold it on my snap. 
I was furious and wanted to die. (Still do) 

So I decided to delete everything the streaming app , I had to wait for OF to delete after a month bc its a 30day subscription. 

I messaged him on snap saying I was going to the police and talked to a lawyer family friend. There was proof I sent him money on cashapp.. and I had taken pictures on a different phone of his threats.. I told him I wouldnt do that if he deleted everything, and moved on and never harassed me again.

He just said ok, fine goodbye. Just that ... 
This all took place in about a 5 week period. 

I havent been able to eat or sleep very well, Ive just thrown myself into my studies. 
Im sure there is stuff I repressed or just forget I am so traumatized and scared he posted my stuff somewhere and I am so embarrassed 

How do I stop being scared? How do I stop feeling shame? (Btw I moved to a new country) My mom has been amazing I dont know what I would do without her 

Also my friend was blackmailed too, but thats not my story to tell

I told my supervisor I can meet this goal, which wastes exponential amounts of money, if we incur overtime. I told them I'm willing to destroy our overtime goal for the year if it's so important I get this done. My supervisor told me to do it and make them realize how much money it wastes. I'm doubtful.

And let me tell you, this never happens to me. I actually get made fun of for having standards that are too high. I think about him all day and I truly have the best time when were together. He always takes care of me if I have some drinks, drives me home, and he calls me every night to tell me about his day.

Two weeks ago we were talking about where our relationship is going and he told me he didnt want to enter into a relationship just yet. I asked him if he was dating anyone else and he said no, but if Im out at a bar I do talk to girls. And I get that, it had only been 3 weeks of us dating. And I appreciated the honesty.

Fast forward to this past Friday, we went out to a bar. He brought two friends and so did I. It was the first time I had met his friends and vice versa. Our friend groups clicked immediately and it ended up being such an amazing night filled with drinks, him telling me how beautiful I looked and how lucky he was to have found me. I ended up spending the night with him. We didnt have sex but we did some other foreplay stuff.

The next morning he drove me home and texted me an hour later saying he already missed me. He then spent the entire weekend being super lovey dovey and saying how he had a great time this Friday and how it made him like me even more.

At this point, I would honestly be devastated if he were dating anyone else. Especially if hes sleeping with other people, since weve started doing some sexual things. I dont want him to necessarily meet all of my friends and family and put pictures of us all over social media. But I want us to exclusively date each other.   

Is it too soon to ask this of him? Im seeing him tonight and was wondering if I should just tell him how I feel. And if it scares him away then so be it. Obviously would be very upset but I want to be with someone who feels the same way, and him not caring if I date others shows he doesnt care about me as much as I care about him.

If she's stated she hates men, and that all men are sexual deviants he probably internalized what his mom has been showing.

What do I do?","She's clearly putting a huge amount of effort into tolerating things she finds off-putting about me, instead of telling me. And then her huge amount of effort spent managing, handling, lying, and avoiding has become another thing she finds unbearable about being around me. 

The way I'm used to relationships working is that people initially find several things off-putting or annoying about me, and at some point they tell me and I fix it and then we get along.

Annie seems to have found a few things off-putting about me around 6 years ago and just carried that burden quietly ever since. 

I'd guess she thinks that she like, owes it to my wife to never be in conflict with me or never say anything negative about me or something. But, uh, it's putting her in secret super awkward conflict with me. 

I feel unsafe around her, because I have nightmares I'm going to just do my best by her, get some stuff wrong because I don't know what she likes or doesn't like, she'll say it's fine, and then in 20 years from now she'll write a heart-wrenching expose about her nightmare brother in law from hell.

I've already overheard her saying to her friend on the phone ""Yeah Snapwillow is visiting and it's as unbearable as always. Rescue me"" and then a bit later got picked up by that friend and disappeared for the day. 

Two things that make this even weirder: 

First: She's super opinionated and outspoken about everything. Always speaks her mind. The one exception is me. Never has any kind of take on me. 

Second: When I see her interacting with people other than me, I think she's a really cool person. Like, she's almost role-model status for me (except about this issue obviously). If she had any kind of feedback, advice, or criticism about me, I'd be eager to hear it. And I've asked for her advice plenty of times.

username#00974,comment,2023-04-17 00:12,,"Damn, Im late to the party but heres what you need to know about coffee. What you had isnt real coffee. Its some rehydrated  burning hot, over roasted piss-water. THATS why you didnt like it. Starbucks and Folgers have bastardized what can truly be a mind-numbingly euphoric experience.  The secret to actual, delicious coffee as it was MEANT to be consumed: 

1. Quality beans. Folgers for example blends in robusta beans which are bitter harsh and disgusting. You need high quality arabica.  

2. Freshly roasted. None of this 8 month old, pre-ground, dehydrated crap.  I recommend no older than 2 weeks, flavor drops off dramatically after 3-4 weeks. 

3. Lightly roasted:  beans have developmental phases that they go through when roasting. As the beans release CO2, there is a distinct crack sound similar to popcorn popping. The closer you end the roast to this phase the more of the beans origin profile you get. Thats where you pick up things like cherry, molasses, chocolate, floral notes etc. thats not what Starbucks and Folgers do. They roast the shit out of it waaaaay past 1st crack until you reach whats called 2nd crack (sounds like rice crispies). At this point your coffee basically tastes like charcoal because youve literally charred the beans. Starbucks does this to hide the poor quality of the beans knowing damn well they are gonna drown their shit water in milk and sugar. 

4. Properly ground. Coffee should be ground fresh before brewing using a burr grinder to ensure an even grind and that all of the flavor filled solubles are extracted. Having a quality burr grinder can be the difference between bitter/astringent coffee and a sweet cup of aromatic nectar. I recommend anything by Baratza. Great company and great products. 

5. Proper ratio and brewing temperature.  The SCAA (specialty coffee association of America) recommends 60g of coffee for 1 liter of water brewed at between 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit. I usually go a little less at around 55g per liter.  Who knows how much Starbucks packs in there. Youll need a brewer that can hit this temp range. I have a moccamaster, best investment ever. 

6. Time. A pot of coffee should take about 5-7 minutes to brew. Longer and you will have a bitter brew. Less time and you will have weak watery coffee. 

7. Quality water. I know this seems over kill but your coffee is 99% water. If you use crappy water its going to be crappy coffee. I use reverse osmosis water that I remineralize using mineral packets designed specifically for the right mineral content for delicious coffee by a company called third wave water. 

I roast my own coffee at home and really enjoy the process of brewing a perfect cup. Ive spent thousands on equipment and its a rewarding hobby. That being said you can do it on the cheap. Google sweet Marias coffee for pointers on how to get started. 

Now if that all sounds like a ridiculously insane amount of effort and time for a simple cup of coffee, I get it. Find a decent roaster/Coffee house that understands the principals I just listed, let them do the work and THEN tell me what you think about coffee ",TooAfraidToAsk

username#00941,comment,2024-09-17 06:10,,"As unintuitive as this sounds, sometimes you have to just feel it out.

The moment to lean in and kiss, you should get a sense of when is right. A lull in conversation or a meaningful glance maybe.

If you're feeling it, then asking someone to come back with you is the most direct way of doing it. Other times, the conversation can be a more coy and teasing. Asking to walk someone back, innocently bringing up something prior ""you mentioned x, I have x at home actually"", anythjng like that. 

As for communications, even if you know it's a one night stand, you're still talking about yourself : connection is still key. People want to know they can be physically vulnerable around you and this can be facilitated by being a bit emotionally vulnerable. Of course if this is a drunken hookup, there's way less communication and more shit like dancing and making out.

On the way home you can make out the whole way, or continue to talk about whatever. You should be able to resume the Moment when you return, as long as the conversation never kills it. Pick a topic that isn't too unsexy, but if they like you it won't matter too much.

All depends on the situation and partner. Get a feel for them and how they like to be talked to.

Everything else is just talked about. Movies don't do it because it's not sexy but asking someone if they're staying for breakfast or of they have to leave is common, and the ""it isn't serious just a one time thing"" is necessary is often a bit awkward to initiate.",TooAfraidToAsk

1. That's judgemental as fuck for such a minor situation. I'm not going to comment further about your relationship but that comment would have stabbed me like a knife.
2. You should make your plans prior to getting in the car.
3. Your wife doesn't want to be responsible for making the plans any more than you do.
4. Re: 2 and 3, you and your wife could have looked online for options for weekend plans and shared the responsibility. It's too late for last weekend but this weekend can still be saved.
5. Do you have separate interests? Just because it was the weekend doesn't mean you NEED to spend it with your wife.

&#x200B;

When I give my wife suggestions for plans for this weekend and she turns me down, my first move is to ask her what she wants to do. If she says ""I don't know"" or ""I don't want to choose"", I use this trick:

I tell her I've made plans for the weekend but they're a surprise and she can guess where we're going. The places she guesses are the places she actually wants to go to.",TooAfraidToAsk

It depends on your definition of ""successful"". In many capitalist countries, the ""success"" you're referring to does not impact the lives of average people, who are entirely removed from the benefits of the ""success"".

If you like blue cheese dressing on a salad, try Boathouse yogurt blue cheese dressing. From mayonnaise try avocado Kraft mayonnaise. Both of these are half the calories and full of that wonderful fat flavor we crave. No loss on the taste. Learn to love an air fryer because who doesn't want crunch. BTW, I have no stake in Noom.

When I make a meal, it's not always feasible to make my own separate portions weighed out. Like when I make spinach lasagna, a large fruit salad, or a large pan of roasted veg. 

Oddly, one meal I really struggle to count correctly is when I make a pot of beans. I usually make a type of bone broth from pork rib bones and use that for the beans. It's often close to three cups of dried beans and a lot of broth. We eat it all day on Sunday. I might get a ladle of beans and one of broth. Or just one of broth, which often has some dissolved beans in it. How the heck do I count it?

username#01210,post,2012-11-08 15:35,Why am I not losing weight?,"Hi loseit!

I'm on day 29 on my diet.  Trying to eat less, and do more exercise.  I started at 110kg, and after nearly 1 month I'm still on 110kg so say the crappy gym scales :(  I'm a 5""10 male, 26 years old.

It should also be noted I've basically eliminated carbohydrates from my diet, all I eat for calories is fat and protein and a bit of veg (admittedly I could eat more veg).  All I drink are diet soda's (about 1 a day) and water of course.

I used to drink a lot, I've eliminated alcohol from my diet except for special occasions.  I was probably eating 2-3 takeaways a week as well before which I've of course eliminated.

Here's my kcal total and exercise total of each day so far:

**Day 1**
1,600 kcal
1 hour 5-a-side competitive football

**Day 2**
2,000 kcal
45 minutes energetic drumming

**Day 3**
1,950 kcal
30 mins competitive football

**Day 4**
1,500 kcal
1 hour drumming

**Day 5**
1,600 kcal

**Day 6**
1,240 kcal

**Day 7**
1,620 kcal
10 mins running
Resistance weight training

**Day 8**
Resistance weight training
1,790 kcal

**Day 9**
2,200 kcal
3 miles walking

**Day 10**
Cheat day (friends wedding).  Didn't go overboard
Resistance weight training
250m swimming breast stroke warm down

**Day 11**
1,800 kcal
30 mins drumming

**Day 12**
1,740 kcal
Resistance weight training

**Day 13**
1,600 kcal
5 mins jogging
7 mins hi intensity interval training (peaked at 16.5kmph, dropped to 4kmph only managed 4 intervals)
600m swimming breast stroke

**Day 14**
1,680 kcal
45 mins drumming

**Day 15**
1,800 kcal
1 hour 5 a side football

**Day 16**
2,000 kcal
Resistance weight training

**Day 17**
1,600 kcal
1,000m swimming breast stroke

**Day 18**
1,970 kcal
2 hours drumming - not too strenuous as was just jamming with a friend

**Day 19**
2,400 kcal
Resistance weight training
200m swimming warmdown

**Day 20**
2,850 kcal

**Day 21**
2,200 kcal
Resistance weight training
200m swimming warmdown

**Day 22**
2,000 kcal
3 miles walking

**Day 23**
Cheat day.  Ate a lot of crap

**Day 24**
850 kcal
30 mins drumming

**Day 25**
2,200 kcal
2 miles walking

**Day 26**
1,700 kcal
Resistance weight training
200m swimming warmdown

**Day 27**
2,500 kcal

**Day 28**
Cheat day, but only ate around 1,700 kcal

In summary I've consumed ~50,000 kcal in 28 days which is an average of around 1,800.  My BMR is probably around 2,500 apparently, so that's a 20,000 kcal defecit, not even taking into account exercise.  A 20,000 kcal defecit should account for about 3kg in weight loss.

I'm feeling very demotivated by the lack of apparently weight loss, any advice welcome!

username#01219,post,2015-12-05 21:37,[NSV] Week 1: I did it!,"Long time lurker of this subreddit. But I feel it is finally time to share my accomplishment. 

I have been obese my entire life. Always the biggest person in the room, the one guy who ate the most. That was me.
I was finally done. I'm a college student, 19 years old and weighing about 380lbs.  

Last week I made the big change. I started to become more vocal about adapting a new lifestyle with my roommates. They totally supported me and offered to start working out with me. I was so ecstatic. I began to start counting my calories with My Fitness Pal and started to work out. At first it was hard, waking up early to complete an hour of cardio in the dorm gym. But boy did it feel good. 
It wasn't till yesterday I had the confidence to travel to the athletic gym that my university offers, and I loved it.
I had to chance to put in some cardio and started to lift weights again just like when I was in football. 
I will be going back there later today, and I can't wait. 

I can honestly say I have never been prouder about myself about this week.

username#01226,post,2014-04-27 03:38,Worried about having loose skin? Take up a prevention method today.,"One of my biggest worries about losing this weight is all the excess skin I'll have to deal with when my journey is complete. I've lost over 150 pounds once before and the amount of skin I had left over was absolutely horrid. I looked all Jabba the hutish. Whelp I regained all of the poundage back plus more so I figured this time I would try to nip this problem in the butt before I'm nothing but a pile of loose skin when I am done.

With the daily routine I am doing every day now I can already tell a huge difference from the previous time I lost the weight. I dry brush my skin after I wake up, shower while applying coconut oil and afterwards I use a skin firming lotion. I repeat the process again before I go to bed. I'm sure any lotion will do but the skin firming was on sale. Also I'm not sure if the coconut oil is adding towards the firming process, but I like the way it makes my skin and hair feel and how its brings out the inner woman from within me (I'm a guy). My underarms and stomach which were/are my two biggest problem areas seem to be shrinking in not only fat but there doesn't seem to be as much skin hanging as there was before. We will see how I look when I am at my goal weight and I don't expect all of my skin to be all tight but hopefully it will make a significant difference. 

I can't guarantee you will have the same results as I am, but I thought I would share since I know this is a big concern for people like me that also have a fuck load of poundage to lose. If you are going to do it I would at least do the dry brush since its cheap and easy. You can find some tips on dry brushing online that you should follow and don't use a synthetic brush, them shits hurt. Best of luck to you.",loseit

It's always more sanctions, more weapons, more aid, but lacking any de-escalation or attempted peaceful approach.
And it doesn't seem to matter which nation or area you live in. (I'm in central europe)

That way, they can rake in the military spending and manufacturing profits and then steer people further into being scared of a full escalation. If nobody had anything to profit by the fear and the war itsellf, and countries like the US, Russia and China really tried to avoid it, they would have reached some type of agreement a long time ago already. 
Everyone knows mutual distraction with WMDs of all global superpowers is assured, there is no point and no gain to anyone to let it escalate to that.

We know about the NWO plan and how one of the final goals is to establish the one world government. Of course, nobody will outright accept that given normal life circumstances. That's where the war mongering comes into play. Perhaps the end goal is to scare the hell out of people with the ongoing ww3 talk and bring the world to the brink of it , so they then happily accept the one world government.

This post is not intended to make people get the vaccine I am a believer in Liberty and then everybody should decide for himself and be left alone.

so this is of course my anecdotal experience here. I expected more side effects. Probably because I also spent a lot of time online  and got to see a lot of critical posts about vaccines and read a lot of bad stories about it. So I got it last week,  I was patiently waiting I even went out drinking that day and had some smokes which you're not supposed to do do and somehow nothing at all happened they always say that the second one hits you harder but there was absolutely nothing and I feel quite good actually.

I was tired and there was akind of sleepiness the first time around but not this time either. Now I can't guarantee to you that it's going to be the same when you do it it but just to put things into perspective I also used to think most people get some kind of horrendous side effects which was the primary reason I was hesitant to even get it. But I'm a healthy young man and I already had the first dose earlier this year so I said fuck it lets  try it. it seems that your body may take it very well too.

It gives people a way to cope with death and avoid depression when a loved one dies. Even if you think that heaven/hell is imaginary, the concept helps people to get over their fears.

Churches and other religious institutions do help the poor and needy. While they do some pretty bad things, we can't forget the good. Not all priests are pedophiles.

Religious institutions can help promote community. People getting together to pray every Sunday helps them form bonds.

The (selective) Bible can be a moral code. Churches don't preach the entire Bible and tend to leave out the parts condoning killing or condemning wearing mixed fabrics.

username#00779,post,2014-08-30 05:39,Going to try to turn a girl born in raised in the bible belt into an atheist. Anyone have any stories of them ever successfully convincing someone or maybe some advice on the matter?,"Here's the situation

About two weeks ago I moved a thousand miles up from my native state of Florida (parent issues), leaving my friends, family, home, school and even dog behind to go live in a completely different part of America with my aunt and her husband. Namely a sparsely populated rural region in what I've come to know as the the Bible Belt.

Yeah.


A week after I moved I started my first day at a new highschool for my senior year, with about 0 or so friends to help get things going. Though regardless of the situation I was actually able to meet a good amount of people and make a few friends, one of which being the girl in question.

Now I'm not a stereotypical pothead liberal know it all hippie, but neither am I a rebel flag bearing, jesus loving redneck hyper-conservative of the south. I'm just....That Guy I guess, if that makes sense. So a coming from a school of mostly minorities to a complete school of whites I was actually able to assimilate pretty seamlessly. Well, at least because I didn't tell anyone I was atheist lol.

Until Friday, at the end of my first week, at the last class, literally in the last 5 minutes. The girl was talking about the church she went to and me being the shitty conservationist, I said this.


Me: You go to church? (I put a lot of emphasis on the word ""church"" while simultaneously pulling my head back like I had just smelt something bad. Muscle memory I guess).

Girl: Yeah its the [insert generic combination of town and church name] down the street from house. Do you go to church?

Me:...No?

Girl: Do you believe in god?

Me: Uh....


Yeah so we spent the next few minutes talking about religion and why I choose to not to care for any organized form of it. I told her that no matter what she believes, at least 1 billion people will think she'll be going to some sort of hell. I went on to talk about how the bible was written by man, and ingrained into our collective psyche over the course of dozens of generations who followed the word of their mothers and fathers without question (In the most polite, non-offensive way I could put it of course). Her response surprised me.

""I choose to go to church as soon as I got my license. Because no one in family does.""

This could mean multiple things.

A. The churches around here are MUCH more convincing and possibly aggressive than those that I'm used to.

B. She has changed her beliefs once, possibly because in a small rebellion of her parents (and likely not the drastic leap that full blown Christian to Atheist would be). But it still shows she is independent and capable of making her own choices regardless of what those around her do.

C. She has a car. I don't, so this helps a lot lol.

Anyways, after this she offered to take me to church one day. I then did something that surprised me, I accepted. But being the space cadet that I am I completely forgot to ask her for her number after we parted ways and I got a ride home from my cousin. In fact, I didn't even think of that crucial detail until hours later. *Hits self*

So yeah, it will definitely not happen this weekend. But the following Sunday there is a good chance I will be going to a room full of Bible crazy church folk with a random cute girl I know from school. Fully aware that I am going to be a veritable ocean of firmly opposing, centuries old opinions. Why, you might wonder, would I do this?

A: Shes cute, I'm into her and I want to know if she's into me (you know, hormones and shit).

B. I've always been curious about what exactly goes on inside those overly expensive walls, and what these people choose to do every Sunday. It will give me a more well rounded view on the world as a whole and even if all goes to shit it will still be another experience to learn from (plus I want to pick up a bible, I've always been curious about what the highest selling volume of fiction in human history is like).

C. I want to test/hone my ability to change the opinion of someone else from one extreme to the other. The current plan is to use the Socratic Method.

D. There isn't much else to do around here lol


So that's it in its entirety Reddit, I want the girl but she wants Jesus. I want her beliefs to change but she wants my beliefs to change. Arguably the largest debate in recorded history occurring for the millionth time between two members of the latest generation.

But at the end of the day I'm just a 17 year old kid. in a world where some nearly septuple my age. So in recognition of my smaller sphere of knowledge and lack of debate skills/experience, I turn to the wonder of our age and in my opinion, the greatest thing to ever fall to humanities hands.


Yes I'm referring to /r/dragonsfuckingcars/

Theyre all good Christians, except one who struggles with the concept of God as a plot point.

For example, him and another character have this interaction:

1. God works in mysterious ways! You know that

2. Thats just a cop-out answer

1. Who are we to judge God?

It doesnt get much more self aware than that, folks. But ofc he becomes Christian again and becomes a good person... And befriends the dude that murdered his father in front of him because the Bible says forgive... I cant make this shit up.

>our denomination are bean-counters. We want to count exactly how many people are in the church, Sunday School, and outreach programs. Easter is always a good way to increase numbers. With corona, I dont know that. I dont have any numbers to report.

Ah. I see, so youre admitting its all about numbers? Why include that? Of course he Segwayed into how Jesus like people here to celebrate his return and blah blah blah, but you have to wonder, why count? Is it to see how thick you need to lay on the collection plate begging? And who are you reporting to? God? Is this part of a large chain of churches? I just found that odd.

Another thing he said:

>Even Atheists you talk to will admit that the resurrection is logically infallible. Most Atheists just refuse to accept it into their hearts...

Im sorry? Are you so deep with your head up your asshole that the echo of yourself is the only thing you hear? What Atheists have you spoken to? Did you hear their thoughts? Their arguments? Were they 3 years old and unable to formulate an opinion?

I did get some humor out of it though. He mentioned holes in the story I hadnt even thought of, then proceeded to ignore them. He talked about how there was no evidence against Christs resurrection. Also confused Greece and Rome. He used them interchangeably. I heard the phrase The tomb is open, he is risen at least 25 if not 30 times.

Whatever he says I would like to be able to know what a Muslim or Jew or Mormon or Gelgamek (anyone, really) would say in his place and what their main argument would be. And honestly, even if I never have to use this I'm still pretty damn curious about what others believe.

So yeah, can any of the more educated atheists/agnostics/whatever's give me any viewpoints?",atheism

Now, my mom has become increasingly Zealous to Christianity since about 2017, and CoVID isnt helping. Shes not horrible, in terms of being pretty mild most of the time, but she has her moments.

When she read this teachers name, she said Oh. You have *him* as a teacher next year. She looked visibly disgusted, and asked me if I knew him.

I knew why she was upset, but I played dumb to see what shed say, and if it was really his orientation she had an issue with.

*He did this* (alluding to thing supposed to be gay)

Ok

*well have you seen him*

Probably

*well Hes...*

He said ""kailashpatinath ki jay""

In hindi ""kailashpatinath"" is a noun and means ""the God who abodes the kailash mountain"" It is a name for the God (whole word is used as name). The ""ki jay"" Is a phrase that is the same as praise/hail, but used at the end of the name of the one who is praised. 

So basically ""XYZ ki jay"" Would mean praise XYZ, here the XYZ is the name of God (name also describes the God very well haha).",funny

I didnt grow up in a church. My parents never took me, I was never in or apart of vacation bible school, etc. I would occasionally go with my grandparents to their baptist church so I told myself I am baptist. Now Im 30 years old, married with kids and still dont go to church. 

I 100% believe in God and try to pray daily and also thank him for everything hes done for me. So why is going to church so hard for me to do? Last year, I made myself go to this smaller church a few times and then we moved and I havent got back into it. 

I just feel so alien when I do go to church. I dont enjoy singing with others (my mom used to bully me for singing so I feel like that is where that stems from), I feel awkward going by myself (my spouses work schedule makes it difficult for him to go). I can take my small kids but they would go to the childrens class which is fine, but then Im alone and feel helpless. I really dont want others to pity me, I just want to go to hear the sermon and go home. Or, I could just stay home and listen to a live sermon, right?

username#01082,post,2023-07-19 02:21,God has been blessing me abundantly lately and I feel the need to talk about it.,"I will make this a short as possible.

A few weeks ago I was in such a dry season. I felt nothing was working out, I was always terribly ill tempered and irritated at the world. All I did was wake up, go to work, come home to cook, then clean go to sleep and repeat. I felt I was surviving and not living. But I also wasnt doing anything for myself, or even trying to make things better because I could not muster up the motivation or energy. I prayed about this. I prayed for peace and grace for myself. I prayed God would pull me out of this slump. 

Then, one day I come home after work and decided I would exercise for a few minutes. I did and I liked how I felt afterwards. I continued doing this for the next couple of weeks where I made myself exercise for at least 20 minutes. I cant even begin to describe how much it has improved my mood, overall. But just having more of a clear mind, I felt it brought me closer to God. That might sound silly, but Im for real. A fog was lifted, and I was just happier and more at peace feeling. All of that from working out? Maybe some, but the other half was definitely an answered prayer.

Now to where Ive been feeling abundantly blessed-

Ive been looking for a new vehicle for about three years now on and off. Every time I thought I was financially set to get another vehicle, something would happen. Or, it was never the right time. The past couple of weeks Ive been looking for a vehicle determined to find something. I prayed that God would lead me to the right vehicle and told him my specifics (that I didnt necessarily need but wanted.) I went to a dealership thinking I had found the one, I even test drove it over night. But in my soul I felt it wasnt right and my spouse wasnt crazy about it either. I was about ready to give up yet again, when I had a close friend reach out to me, showing me a vehicle for sale, one that I had always wanted. I looked at this vehicle in person, and I soon as I sat in it, I knew it was the one for me. I couldnt believe it, it was literally everything that I have wanted in a vehicle plus more. I was approved with ease and shockingly my payments arent even going to be that bad. I was so thankful and thanked God over & over on the way home after driving it home from the lot. 
 
Then, I was looking for a very important piece of mail that I needed to bring with me to my job tomorrow for insurance benefits. I had had this letter for several weeks, lying on my counter, and when I went to look for it today. I could not find it anywhere. I searched my house inside out with no luck. All of the offices that I needed to contact about this info were closed. And with insurance, I have a crunch time so if I didnt find it by this evening, I would probably be screwed. I prayed and asked for God to help me find this letter. After about an hour or more of searching, I checked one more spot and there it was, exactly what I was looking for.

Now, all of this might sound silly or coincidental to some, but I believe 100% that it has been God blessing me. I feel that maybe by me working on myself, this is his way of rewarding me, I dont know, but I love this feeling of being closer to him in and the blessings are so very appreciated.",Christianity

I dont nor have I ever expressed hate towards those that dont share or practice my beliefs. I simply dont agree with some things. I dont always agree with the new norm, I didnt agree with a certain past President of the US, I believe homosexuality is a sin, among other major things that are being normalized. I dont understand why it is okay for others to express what they agree/disagree about but it is not okay when I express my agreement/disagreement? Again, I feel the need to repeat that I have never been harsh or judgemental when expressing my values. People talk poorly of Jesus, Christians, and the church all the time. Sure, Christians and the church have their faults but who doesnt? The second I mention I am a Christian, I am automatically labeled homophobe, racist, among other labels. I am none of those things. I dont label or mistreat those that disagree with me. I encourage their opinion because it allows me to grow and see life through their perspective. Yet the second I show any form of disagreement, I get mistreated and labeled. I dont get it. They are allowed to voice their opinion but I cannot?

Its all real! and within seconds of that, this old truck with the word believe on the eyebrow of the windshield passed me. I was like woah.. Ok, so it is real because something just came over me!

I went to my best friends house after school to play and eat dinner. Ive always loved food. Ive always been taller/bigger than the rest of my classmates (I was a 5 foot 3 fifth grader (my moms height)). Anyways, there I was eating dinner with my best friend and her mom. I asked for seconds and she and her mom looked at me and laughed. Her mom proceeded to call me fat. My best friend agreed with her. There I was, a 10 year old, unaware of insecurities and such until that moment. From that moment on, I was self conscious in everything I wore. I cried when jeans didnt fit me (even though it was just because I was growing). I look back at photos now and cry because I wasnt even fat. I spent my entire life thinking I was fat and that no one would love a fat girl. I am now an incredibly insecure 24 year old and I almost want to blame it on my childhood best friend and her mom. I wish I could go back and tell my 10 year old self to love herself, maybe things would be different today. Ive asked God to free me from this countless times. Ive cried out to Him.

username#01095,comment,2017-12-07 16:31,,"People who go through a significant weight loss/gain and then suddenly their SO isn't ""attracted to them"" fail to realize something before.

In order to go through that much weight the person needs to go through a significant lifestyle change. You basically become a different person with different habits, not just physically. You develop a different way of thinking, your day to day schedule changes, and your habits change. So if you meet a partner and one of your hobbies together is watching movies and gaming while ordering in. Then suddenly your hobbies are dancing and walks in the park while meal planning, you can't fault them for not being interested in anymore. 

Same thing happens when a 40 year old dates a 20 year old. Over time the 20 year old will grow up and develop new interests causing the 40 year old not be attracted to that person anymore. 

My advice is decide if you two are still compatible. Is it just because you look different? Do both your lifestyles compliment each other? Maybe it's time to find someone who can?",relationships

username#01116,post,2024-09-24 19:08,I (26F) might have fallen out of love with my boyfriend (28M). He doesnt want to it end.,"Hi! All in title really. Been together 10 years. If you look at my post history youll see we had a tough spot around 4 years ago, I broke up with him thinking Id fallen out of love. After a while being apart I decided I wanted to try again and make it work, and it was amazing for around a year. Then went back to how it was before.

So now this is where Im at. Pretty unhappy and not feeling fulfilled at all. Ill try bullet point our problems 

 We are not having sex. He tries to initiate regularly but I usually turn him down. I dont feel sexually attracted to him and dont have the desire to have sex anymore. Its been around 3 months now and I could be happy with another 3 years without sex (questioning possibly asexuality? Or is it just this relationship)  

constant criticisms. Its never in a hateful or spiteful way, but constantly being told Im dramatic, sensitive, overreacting, being stupid etc. It starts to wear a person down and makes me feel incredibly low.

different political views, hes right wing and Im left. I can respect we have a difference in opinion on some topics, but I worry about issues that may arise when raising future potential children. 

his mother treats me poorly and makes unkind remarks. He never sticks up for me or says anything to his mom.

he is constantly sick. A headache, stomachache, earache, indigestion, bad back. He has no diagnosis of any chronic illness. Its draining listening to him complain daily about this. I think its anxiety but he disagrees.

because of his constant state of being sick/unwell, we rarely get out the house. Or have to cancel things last minute. I tend to go out and do things on my own now, like going to the movies or trying a new spot for lunch.

I dont give him enough affection. I give some cuddles/kisses/words of affirmation but I do admit theyre not as frequent as they used to be. He complains this makes him feel unloved and I need to show him more. If I answer the phone in a normal tone, he will ask me to try again in a happier voice. He wants to feel like Im excited to talk to him/see him.

 he does not appreciate my job or career, makes ignorant comments or if Ive had a bad day he doesnt care to understand why or how. He thinks Im being dramatic. 

 arguments. We argue so much. More than my friends do with their partners. Theyre never screaming, crying, throwing or violent. Theyre more like conversations where we go back and forth constantly. These conversations can last for hours. Im lucky if they only last for 1 hour. They can be over really small, minuscule things. For example, I didnt give him a hug when I saw him and it made him feel like I wasnt excited to see him. Hes told me before he needs more affection, why arent I doing it?

we never really talk much about anything. We talk about our days, daily things like chores, or something new we saw at the supermarket. But otherwise we dont talk much (maybe this is normal in long term relationships?)

 he says he is always excited to see me but I feel like it is a chore. Trying to give more affection, trying not to react when he says Im dramatic, trying to avoid saying something that lead to an argument. 

I tried to tell him at the weekend that I think we are just not compatible anymore. We got together young, weve both grown up and changed and I dont think we work well together. I know I have my faults too, these problems in our relationship are because of us BOTH. I cant meet his needs anymore and he cannot meet mine. 

I went over all of the above comments with him, and he basically just denied every point and said its fine. He thinks the thing that will fix everything is I just give him more affection. If I do that then everything else will be fine as its just a vicious circle. Hes also suggested we try seeing a sex therapist. When I tried saying I wasnt happy and think this might be the end, he was telling me Im just throwing this all away without even trying.

Im done. Im tired. I just dont know. I cant figure out if Ive fallen out of love or if our mundane lives have driven me to such Boredom and misery. What should I do? Does this sound like a relationship that can be saved? 


Tl;dr - me and my boyfriend have lots of issues that never get resolved. He denies it and thinks we can make it work if I give him more affection. can this relationship be saved?",relationships

username#01072,comment,2019-02-12 17:00,,"The thing is, maybe they did more than just kiss (and that after only one month). If he was under the impression that she didn't wanna bone and made a mistake, then i don't think he would have taken the texting to a sexual level. It's a bigger leap to go from not kissing to kissing, than it is from kissing to oral or worse. Also, she didn't tell you about it, you had to find out yourself by snooping. Will you ever trust her the same way again? Probably not. But even if you find a new girl you really like, how are you to know she wouldn't do the same if she was 8000 miles away, for more than a month? If she hadn't met that guy, then maybe it wouldn't have happened, maybe it would with someone else and be even worse. You can't know for sure about these kinds of situations with anyone. What you can do, is judge a person by their action, and how they handled it. I personally have more of an issue with the fact that she didn't come clean immediately after it happened, until you found out yourself (maybe even still hasn't completely). Maybe wait until she's back to make a decision. ",relationships

username#01090,post,2018-10-24 04:00,I (25F) think I might be being taken advantage of by a homeless man (?M),"UPDATE 2: He came back and would not leave. I told him first that I could not help him and asked him to go, then that I would call the police if he didnt leave. Then he stayed, so I called the cops. I also told one of my roommates the gist of what happened (the other roommate is away) and she was upset but also quite kind to me. Ive been video chatting with my mom since a half hour after I posted this and started getting your answers and I am attempting to do my reading for my class tomorrow. Well see how that goes, Barthes is hard enough at the best of times. Thank you for your answers.

UPDATE: thank you all for confirming. Im currently going over my actions and realizing just how many mistakes I made because I was scared to say no. Im definitely not going to contact him again beyond a please do not contact me message and probably not even do that. Im gonna tell my roommates what I did and throw myself on their mercy. And Im gonna call the police if I need to.

Hi all. What the title says, I think I might be being taken advantage of but Im worried that I might feel that way bc of prejudice. Please help me sort this out.

Heres the story: Last week I went out for a drink with a classmate and at the end of the night I went back to my place in a lyft and was joined by a guy I met at the bar. I had too much to drink so my memory is fuzzy re: how exactly he ended up there with me but he needed a place to spend the night and we had talked long enough that I felt itd be safe to let him do so. He got up and left after a few hours. Before he left he asked if I could give him any cash. I offered $5 (Im a student and do not have a lot of money, my classmate bought my drinks bc he is nice and it was my birthday the next day) and he said he needed $20. I didnt have any cash so I went to the 711 across the street and I think I ended up giving him $15. We said goodbye; I thought that was the end of it.

Two nights ago he showed up at my apartment at 3:00 in the morning and asked if he could crash for a few hours since he had just seen his friend arrested and was freaked out. I said yes. He stayed until 6 and when he left he again asked for money ($20) saying he would pay me back after I told him I could only give him $5. I gave him $20. He left.

He called me later to say he left his portable phone charger in my apartment. I had to leave and spend the day on campus so I left it with the owner of the corner store (not the 711) and told him someone would be by to pick it up. I called the guy back and left a message saying where he could pick up the charger, but then I got another call saying he had borrowed someone elses phone to call me so he had no way of getting the message.

I got a text today saying that he needed to pick up the charger and I explained what I had done. He said he would be by to pick it up in the afternoon, but then called me at 7 to say he was on his way over. I texted him I was on the bus (bc I was) and have not heard back. I did not ask the corner store guy if the charger has been picked up.

Im wondering what if anything I should do. I know what I want to do, which is ignore him if he comes by looking to crash again, but I dont know if thats because Im being taken advantage of or because Im being selfish.

TLDR: homeless man crashes at my place twice, both times asking me for money I cant really afford to give him. I give him the money, he leaves. Am I being unreasonable or am I being taken advantage of? If its the latter how can I safely end the relationship since he has my phone number and knows where I live? (I dont think hed be violent but Ive interacted with him twice so I dont know for sure, and Id rather be safe than sorry.)",relationships

username#01089,post,2018-10-07 22:11,I [24F] broke up with my boyfriend [25M] of two years,"Im not sure if this is the right subreddit. But I just wanted to share my experience in hopes that someone else whos feeling the same way can relate and know they arent alone.

When my boyfriend and I met, I thought he was a really sweet guy. He was funny, good looking, and genuinely a nice person. Eventually our friendship would turn into two years of dating. 

But I never felt incredibly excited when we did. I never had those butterflies I had with other guys, I wasnt head over heels or waiting for his every text. Ive never had a serious long term relationship before, so I told myself this is how mature people fall in love. I wanted so badly to have a boyfriend, to feel what its like to love and be loved. I never have before.

Throughout our two years dating, we had a lot of fun times. We traveled within the states, hung out with friends, went out to concerts and festivals and restaurants. And he turned into my best friend. But there was always something missing. 

Our sex life wasnt bad. But it wasnt entirely earth shattering either. It was just okay. He was incredibly socially awkward and he always made me order our food at restaurants or so anything that involved talking to other people. He didnt fit in with with my group of friends, and I would constantly have to explain to them why he was always so quiet. I, on the other hand, am extremely outgoing so this bothered me a lot. 

I began to see that were really incompatible in many other ways but I would let it go because he loved me. I would look at other guys and see the traits I wish I had in a guy and say I wish he had that. And I felt horrible for it. But I would tell myself do you know how hard it is to find someone whos smart and loyal and who loves unconditionally? So I would just ignore my feelings. 

And then finally, when he brought up marriage, I said to myself he would make a good dad. I knew I wasnt in love with him. But I knew he would make a good husband and father. And so I began to settle.

We planned the house we would buy, how we would raise our kids, our finances, etc. During this time, I had a gut feeling that this wasnt meant to be. It was horrible but I kept it to myself. I never told a single friend about it. 

One day, I was having lunch with my mom, and she told me she could sense that I was on the fence. And I just broke down crying. I told her how I felt. And she told me I had to end it for my sake and for his. 

So I did. I told him I wasnt in love with him and that he deserved someone who was head over heals for him. I told him he deserved someone who worshipped the ground he walked on, because he really did. He was the sweetest person I know, my best friend in every sense of the word. I cried and he cried but ultimately he said he wanted me to be happy. And I wanted the same for him, truly.

I feel like a horrible person for not having told him earlier, for not having the courage to. I was afraid of starting over, of being alone, of never finding love. But I deserve to find love and so does he. 

Im always going to miss our showers together and how he used to clean behind my ears for me and kiss me on the forehead. Ill miss laying down naked on sundays playing video games and watching movies. Ill miss our long drives to other states and our restaurant adventures. Ill miss how he would warm up the towel for me while I showered so I would be warm when I got out.


But Im happy hell find true, mutual love. And hopefully one day I will too.


TL;DR - If youre in a relationship with someone you dont love, please find the courage to find someone you DO love. Your SO deserves it and so do you. Life is short.

The thing is, we already know half the country supports Trump. No one is changing anyone's mind who still thinks Trump is deserving of their vote in 2024 after his presidency, conviction, etc. These are the people we are fighting against.

Trump's debate performance wasn't shocking. It was status quo. He was as much of a monster as he has shown he is since before 2016. Yet his support remains unaltered. Biden won by a couple tens of thousands of votes in 2020 and is currently polling far below his numbers then, when he barely squeezed by a win. 

Democrats have all of this information, and are choosing to ignore it. No one has ever been saying 2024 republicans aren't to blame. We're now saying the democratic leadership is to blame too. Running Biden is the best thing they could ever do for the Trump campaign.

So you think everyone should live by your philosophy? How is that different from a state imposing its beliefs

>voluntaryism


Voluntaryism contradicts itself. In a voluntaristic society, people who don't believe in voluntaryism would be forced into it against their will. Unless everyone agrees with voluntaryism in a society, it is involuntary for at least one person.


>self-ownership, 

People aren't property. If I own myself, it follows that someone else can own my via conquering. This is immoral, in my opinion.


>non-aggression principle.


Also contradicts itself. If I believe that something is aggression that you don't, or that a form of aggression is justified, like private property, I can use self-defense. However, you would want my to conform to your notion of aggression, which is inherently aggressive.



>You didn't. That's the problem.


Property exists independently of morality. How to distribute property is a moral question.  But the fact that I acquired property immorally doesn't mean I don't own property.


>Hardly a moral or legitimate use of force, wouldn't you say?


Right, I don't think you should conquer people's land.


>And you accept it? If you do, we really have nothing to discuss.


If they can defend it, I have no choice.



>But you said I could do it with the moon...


I didn't say that conquering the moon would be moral or justifiable. I just said it would be your property


> definition of property.


""Exclusion of others to a certain parcel of land or other object.""


>I don't think most people do.


So why did you think I could justify genocide?",politics

Not thinking anything about it. A few months went by and I was on my way to stupid church camp. I get there, check in and start talking to old friends. Not a single person in the same room as me....A girlfriend over hears me and says ""That's! Our room??"". I start to laugh, as I remember what I did and just went along with it. It took 24hr for the supervisor to notice I was a male in a female cabin. (Some girl complained.) 

The best part of the story was I told people I did it to get the ladies. I ended up getting the nickname ""Godfather"" (From the popular WWE wrestler at the time.) The story got so big, even the counselors started calling me it. It even got up to the high school kids. Needless to say, Out of 400 kids. I was the cool one. At the end of summer camp they pulled me up in front of all the parents and kids and explained my story. I was never forgot.

Talk to any black man and theyll tell you things like this happen _all_ the time. Not just being killed, but systematic profiling, accosting, and overall lack of justice. And the whole police film everything now - like the police dont routinely accidentally turn off the cameras, or as if they are constantly scanning their own footage looking for bad apples. Its a widespread problem, just like black on black violence is. Lets try and sweep it under the rug by saying well black on black violence kills more people so why do you care so much. As if the seriousness of one problem is canceled out by the other. I hope you see the error in that kind of thinking.

The WHOLE POINT here is that this one death isnt some major tragedy, its that its indicative of a much larger issue in our society where black men are seen as less than and expendable. THAT is the issue worth discussing, even if other large problems in society exist.",WTF

Vasectomies are not 100%, they tell you that when you consult. They warn you that recanalization can occur. 1.5 years is well within standard recanalization window and not even an outlier.

A person who gets a vasectomy makes a decision that for all intents and purposes is a permanent commitment. But that commitment requires following all procedures and to know the risks.

So I am angry at the guy for not following through.

I am also angry that this post is deflecting blame and that there are so many people agreeing that this situation is 100% the fault of the idiot male partner with no blame saved for the other for their part in the situation.

Even with a vasectomy the guy could have worn a condom and it was a decision they BOTH made to forgo additional protection. Not to even mention the other forms of protection available to both the male and female partner.

Thankfully she is in a state that recognizes her body autonomy and allows for abortion. I am sorry you have to go through that.

Even with a vasectomy, utilize other forms of contraception as well. (And leave off the ""until"" entirely).",TwoXChromosomes

I cant go on like this but Im so broke and have awful health insurance.,"I was diagnosed with anxiety (GAD) a couple years ago. I was seeking counseling for it and benefited from it, when I had great insurance. Fast forward to now, husband got a new job and the insurance is shit. Utter shit. Not only that, but I called about three therapists in my area and none of them accepted my insurance. Each session is about $90 here and I simply cannot afford that. I would ask family for help, but weve already had to have help and am paying some family members back monthly, so Im not doing that. 

Im 26F but I worry chronically. Its now become where I worry myself sick. Especially over health related issues, some that any normal person wouldnt bat an eye at. Im over sensitive to any symptom and not just in myself but my families, too. Its not just occasionally that I worry, but about every other day. Ill start to think about something, find one sign that it could be awful and I cant for the love of Pete get my mind off of it. 

Its affecting my mood, which effects my relationship with my family, and Im afraid Im going to lose control. I need help. I dont know where to turn.

He was home for awhile and left about a week ago. My period was supposed to come about 5 or 6 days ago (give or take) and still nothing. I have been super stressed with work and his work so that may be the culprit. However, my periods were still coming regular even with stress the last few months. This past month was more stressful though.

I mentioned our safe sex. We use condoms but are bad about waiting a few minutes (sometimes even halfway in) to put them on. That is what is concerning me the most.

Im sitting in the doctors office as we speak, after just peeing in a cup. 

Last night around 11pm-midnight my lady bits started feeling strange. I kept having the urgency to pee. 

This morning into the afternoon, I feel ok but I keep having to pee! When I do pee, it feels weird. No pain, just weird. Ok, something is up. Im drinking water like crazy now. 

Around 4pm to currently, I started getting chills and the urge to urinate has been stronger. Now there is a tinge of blood in my urine. Omg! Still no pain when peeing or in my back/bladder. 

Off to the doctor I go. My temp was 98.6 at the doctor (after I had already taken fever reducer.) I just peed in a cup and there was some blood. (I did just stop my period the day before yesterday.)

I googled UTI symptoms and stories and now I wish I wouldnt have. 

Ugh. Im scared.

UPDATE: I am alive and well. The doctor gave me antibiotics and I started feeling better the next day. The doctor told me that low grade fevers are common with UTIs and she thinks we caught mine early enough. Thank you everyone, so much, for your encouraging words and advice!

username#01082,post,2017-12-31 17:14,Took a plan b for the first time in years while I was on antibiotics. Weird side effects and a nervous wreck.,"I had unprotected sex with my fiance (we usually use condoms) after I had picked him up from the airport. I had ended my period about 8 days prior to this. He ""pulled out"" but he was not 100% sure there wasn't a drop or two that didn't make the cut. 


As much as I hated to, I took a plan B about 15 hours afterwards. I was also finishing a course of antibiotics (amoxicillin) for a bad sinus infection. I'm not on hormonal birth control anymore. I got off of them 7 months ago because they was causing me not to have a period. I've been pretty regular since and we've been using condoms.


I asked the pharmacist if those two drugs had any interactions and she said ""antibiotics can lower the efficiency of plan b. You may also experience bad side effects like nausea and passing out."" Then kind of just shook her head at me. She was rude.


A week later after taking the plan b, I had an out of the blue bad stomach ache which turned into a period like cramp that had me laying on the cold floor in the bathroom at work because I sweating so bad and in much discomfort. Lasted a good five minuets then I was ok again except for high anxiety for the rest of the day. It felt like I was going to start my period but certainly did not. I'm still a good week and a half away from my period anyway. That stomach pain episode did kind of freak me out but I just chalked it down to a side effect of plan b. The last time I took plan b was about 3 years ago with no side effects whatsoever except maybe a little moodiness.


I'm trying not to worry but If I hadn't been on those dang antibiotics I probably wouldn't even be sweating this. I just needed to get this out. Thanks

I paid thousands of dollars a while back on steroid shots for my back, which has major nerve damage. How come I can't force all employers to cover that?

My point is, whatever options we get are already filtered by whatever the employer wants to spend. I don't see why filtering by religious beliefs is any different. Like everyone else, if I'm not happy with my benefit I buy additional coverage.

The real solution is employers shouldn't be involved with healthcare coverage at all. You should get a higher wage and buy your own on a state or federal market.

Still kind of freaked out tho.,"I've been on a breast cancer anxiety ride lately. Ever since my boobs have been having weird ""twinges"" (come to find out its pretty normal) I've been constantly checking my boobs for any lumps or changes and reading everything I can about breast cancer. Which is just making my anxiety worse. 

I was standing at the kitchen sink, loading the dish washer when I got the urge to do another breast check, (yes, I've been doing it compulsively) I was feeling way down deep with my fingertips near the tops of my boobs close to the bra strap when I thought I ran a finger over a tiny lump. My heart starts pounding and I check the other breast in the same spot, I feel a lot of tiny lumps that I believe are fatty bits in both of my breasts, in the same area. 

I'm still shaking though. When I check my breasts with my palm or with all fingers together and flat, where I can run them over my breasts, I don't feel any lumps anywhere. Same thing when I'm in the shower with soapy boobs, I don't feel any lumps. I've read where you can ""create"" your own lumps by using your fingertips when its 9 times out of 10 just breast fat. 

Would a breast lump that should be checked out be really hard like a metal ball? Are they more likely to be felt with flat hands? I guess I don't 100% know what exactly to be checking for with lumps.

I'm still shaking though. Last time I had a breast exam/pap smear was two years ago. I'm 25.

It's a cool concept, but in Digital Audio latency is such an important obstacle that utilizing the GPU via PCIe becomes a hefty challenge (as it also needs to be kept in sync with CPU and now you have to wait for the slowest of the two per buffer). Most VST algorithms are refined enough that there is no need to purposely build out overly complex systems to use GPU Audio.",pcmasterrace

/u/yeeb0p-\> $50 Steam Card

u/Sonicator/  -> $50 Steam Card 

[u/incelking69](   \-> $50 Steam Card

Please contact me by message in the 48h ;)

EDIT2: The Giveaway is now over, thanks to all of you for your participation. The Steam Card winners will be announced in few hours. People who registered by email will be contacted soon :)

Hello,Giveaway Ends: August 30th, 11:59 EST,I'll randomly pick 3 winners for the $50 Steam Cards August, 31st and announce them at the top of the post.

I'm AxelG a solo dev and today I'd like to share with you 2,500 Steam Keys for my latest production and 3 chances to win a $50 Steam Gift Card.

Proofs: [

To Get your Key, simply send ""Ours is PCMR"" or ""PCMR"" to [ extra-step. There's a 24h delay to check the entries manually and remove the potential doubles.FB is chosen here for simplicity and due to the number of Steam Keys distributed.

EDIT1: I added a new way to participate since some of you don't use Facebook anymore:You can claim your key [here]( You have to put an email though, I didn't want to ask people email that why I choose FB initially. For email users the keys will be delivered at the end of the end of the Giveaway :)

You're free to leave your top 3 favorites PC brands in the comments, mine are ASUS, Razer and Gigabyte\~

Note: \*Even if there is no more key to distribute your entry will be counted for the Steam Gift Cards selection ;)\*Note2: *The rewards are exclusive to* r/PCMasterRace *meaning you can't receive two Steam Keys or Steam Gift Cards from one of the few other subreddit giveaways*

Extra Story Time:

\~About the production, it's an action-packed visual novel series, bear with me, picturing the adventures of two former child-soldiers now top-tier mercenaries.

It's called Dragon and Weed: Origins, the [Prologue/ Ep.0]( is free the keys will be for [Episode 1]( ($3,99).Weird name, niche story, so why should you try it?Well, everything is niche unless there's a broad audience around it, right?Started back in 2007, DW has now engaging characters and an evolving plot, that doesn't rely only on the two main protagonists.

Far from Manichean, as the story goes, you will grow to like, hate and maybe identify to characters from all sides.

Unless it blows\~, you won't ear from Dragon and Weed in the media, for the reasons quoted above and because there are very little concessions made in the direction which can make it difficult to pitch. Strong language, ""awkward"" situations, nudity/ sex, and violence with little regard for the usual political correctness we can find in multiple forms of entertainment.

Of course, no revolution here and DWO doesn't resume to these points, but it is a quite carefree production.

With the visual novel medium, it is possible to combine graphics, texts, voices, and music in an all in one container. I like to consider it as a form of interactive digital comic-book.

If after Ep.0 and 1, you don't hook, which is okay, well at least you'll have been bold enough to try something new and you won't even have spent a dime ;)

Anyway, have a wonderful day/evening and Good Luck for your entry!",pcmasterrace

...which strongly implies that horses would not have been left free to roam upstairs if they smelled something and that spiral staircases were definitely NOT installed to prevent that happenstance. 

My guess: the staircases were installed to save space (cause thats the primary purpose of spiral staircases) and someone thought of this rationalization afterward and it caught on because its a weird fact that sounds plausible (but isnt, because there are a million other simpler and less expensive methods to keep a horse away from your 2nd story dinner table).",todayilearned

username#01201,comment,2021-11-05 14:19,,">Everett many-worlds is not so weird interpretation of quantum mechanics, however leads to very weird interpretation of reality.

As a physicist I would like to point out that many-worlds is functionally identical to Copenhagen, and that despite what some people claim it does not actually solve the measurement problem, it just reframes it in terms of branches rather than collapse. It's really not a good theory, it adds metaphysical complexity to the universe while telling us nothing about observable reality.

>Choices made in human brains on the other hand are most likely the realm of classical physics and an example of something that doesnt split the universe.

The distinction you're making between classical and quantum physics is artificial (unless you're anti-reductionism I suppose, but there's nothing really to justify that position), all classical behaviour emerges from quantum behaviour, by the time you've 'made a decision' the universe would have had to split countless times.

username#01239,post,2024-10-18 20:00,"r/piercing rule, comments about appearance and/or any sexual comments are not allowed","Hey everyone,

Although we do our best to make the rules of this subreddit as clear as we can within the characters limits, we notice that sometimes theres some confusion or misunderstanding about the rules. 

In this post we want to clarify the most common misconceptions about **rule number 4, comments about appearance and/or any sexual comments** **are not allowed**

*Zero tolerance for comments about appearance that are unrelated to the poster's piercing(s). For example physical features, perceived flaws, beauty and/or any sexual comments. Offending users will be banned.*

This subreddit is about piercings and we want all the people posting here showing off their piercings feel secure and safe in that the only topic of discussion will be their piercings. 

**Misconception number one**, the rule **only applies** to unkind, rude, insulting or lewd comments not related to the featured piercing(s)

**Wrong**. The rule applies to all comments unrelated to the featured piercings. It doesnt matter if your comment was meant in kindness or as a compliment. Simply assume that the people posting on a piercing subreddit want to show of and talk about piercings and they are fully capable of finding suitable subreddits if they want to receive comments about their appearance. 

**Misconception number two** the rule is **gendered**.

**Wrong**, just like piercings arent gendered, neither is this rule. It doesnt matter what gender OP has, or what the gender is of the one commenting, the rule applies to and for **everyone**. If you break down the demographics of this subreddit most likely there are more female identifying posters then male identifying posters, but all deserve to feel safe in knowing that their piercings are the only topic of discussion.

**Can I ask......?**

Yes, you may ask what brand or colour the lipstick is thats visible in the photo.

Yes, you may ask what hair products someone uses for their curls, how they got their eye liner so perfect, who the tattoo artist is of that amazing tattoo thats visible in the photo or what watch brand that is or how the cat is called.

Rule of thumb, if its visible  in the photo and it is something OP applied or added to themselves you may (politely) inquire about it. 

**A special note about** **DM and chat**

The advice we actually dislike to give, because it shouldnt be needed but if you are posting a photo, especially of nipple or genital piercings, consider (temporarily) **disabling DMs**. Most of our community is awesome and wouldnt even consider breaking the no comments about appearance or sexual comments rule even if it wasnt a rule.     

Unfortunately that doesnt go for everyone that will see your photo. Fact, sexualising someone without their consent is specifically against Reddit TOS. We want to encourage you to report those DM's and chat for harassment, those reports go straight to Reddit admin.

* [Report chat](
* [Report DM](

Dont be discouraged if Reddit reports back that no action has been taken because reports to stack up. Admin might not be able to act now, that doesnt mean they wont act once theyve received several reports. Because lets be real, youre unlikely to be the only one theyve been harassing through DM or chat

**We regularly see comments noticing how kind and welcoming this community is**, and we want to **thank you** for creating and contributing to that atmosphere. As moderators we try our best to keep it that way but we do rely on your help for that. So if you see a post or comment that doesnt follow the rules of this subreddit, please hit the report button. We simply cannot read every post or comment so we rely on your input to keep this community awesome.",piercing

I did not go to college.

I did not join the service.

I am currently making 75,000/yr as a Business Analyst.

I am definitely of the opinion that except for specific professions that require a lot of specialty skills/knowledge, you do not need college and in fact it can hamper you via massive debt. Though it may, possibly, get you to my point earlier.

It took me till 46 years of age to climb up the ladders to get where I am today. I also had what I consider the pivotal point being when I was laid off from a job and given a severance that along with unemployment benefits allowed me to not worry about eating and to seek a higher paying job without taking the first thing that was offered out of fear of not being able to survive without it...

It's definitely something that takes a bit of self confidence to be able to say no to a job offer and walk away as well as the means to survive the duration of the job search without soul crushing worry that you need a job NOW.

username#00898,post,2023-09-03 15:09,Discussion: What Have Managers Learned From Antiwork?,"I'm a person who started working at 14. Fell into IT in the mid 90s (right time, right place) and worked my way up from the third circle of hell doing phone technical support for an ISP to now managing multiple teams of Dev and DevOps engineers. 

Yup, I'm a part of the dreaded ""management"" this sub rails against. 

I read this sub because I spent years working under shit managers, and the anecdotes (especially when there is payback involved) are delicious. But I also pay attention to the ways a manager should NOT behave. Especially when I first became ""the boss,"" I read some posts that helped me identify negative patterns and behaviors folks showing me the ropes thought were motivational.

Some themes from here reinforce my management style:
- The role of a manager is to protect your reports from stupidity and bullshit.
- Managers are responsible for schedules. 
- Once you've made a commitment (e.g., okayed time off), if things change it's my problem to fix.
- Being aware and hyper proactive about addressing burnout 
- It's healthy to work to live, but not to live to work
- Make sure folks take ALL their vacation time.

Most important is a phrase I use on a regular basis I (think) I picked up here:
""In 20 years, the only people who will remember you worked 12 hour days are your family.""

I'm curious as to what other management types have learned here.",antiwork

Doesn't mean they aren't intelligent people.

My personal story was that I was living in a location that originally had me going to the high-school in the well off neighborhood. Olympic pools, auto shop, planetarium, metal shop, wood shop, computer labs....

Then my family moved to the ghetto. The quality of the school showed.

The advanced placement calculus and chemistry classes might as well have been remedial. There was no auto shop, no metal shop, no wood shop, no Olympic swimming, no computer labs, no planetarium...

So I just stopped doing any work. No reason to. I could sleep through a class and pass using simple reasoning.

That experience taught me that schooling I useless unless targeted learning. If I had remained at my original high school, with all the bells and whistles and opportunities....who knows where I would be today.

At the very least I could probably do my own mechanic work on my car....

That being said it also taught me that companies do not need anyone with a degree unless it's specific targeted and intensive information. The rest is just common sense and experience.

I taught myself excel, access databases, learned other software such as AS/400 as needed for jobs.

What was my ""in"" to high pay? When I was 20 I created a spreadsheet that tracked large equipment rentals for a mechanical contracting company because I noticed on the bills that I was processing there was large amounts of late return fees.

And all that was needed to not pay that fee was to call them before due date and extend the rental.

So all it did was track the item, when we had rented it till, and 1 week before it was due, it would create a report to send to the buyer to simply extend the rental.

BAM, millions in late fees saved for the company.

I wear that like a badge on my resume. Front and center. I don't care that it was 20 years ago.

That is what was impressive to employers. The ability to create a solution to a problem, even if the company itself didn't know it WAS a problem.",antiwork

3. Active Duty? Attend SFL-TAP as early as 18 months prior to separation.

5. I made a spreadsheet with several resources specifically meant to assist transitioning military members, and there might be something in there that you find useful: [One Drive Link]( or [Google Drive Link](

username#01221,comment,2021-12-18 14:17,,"Being a gamer.

I was the nerd that would create spreadsheets of game data. Plot out quests in MMOs and break out ""optimal"" builds and such.

So I learned to use basic excel and fast typing during my youth.

I learned that I was able to find bugs and inconsistencies a lot and did a lot of alpha and beta testing when those words were ACTUAL alpha and beta testing and not just people getting a head start at playing a game before release.

So with that background, I started doing a lot of general office jobs. Accounting, payroll, pure data entry.

Then I landed a job doing purchasing support. Basically data entry of large machine rentals for an HVAC/construction company.

My breakout was when I noticed the company was spending a TON of money on late returns for these machine rentals because jobs never finished on time really.

The funny part was that you could just call up and extend a rental and BAM. No late charge.

So I created an automated tracker spreadsheet in excel that would track each rental and the date it was due to be returned and I would send that report to the senior buyers and they would authorize extensions.

Saved the company thousands of dollars a day.

I was 20.

I use that on my resume today two decades later.

I ended up getting laid off from a job that decided India could do our job cheaper/faster/better (Narrator: That was a disaster, LOL)

I had a severance package and unemployment. I was not in a position where I didn't know where my next meal was coming from and in a position where I didn't NEED to take the first job tossed my way.

I was at that time making $17/hr.

I started job hunting and included a temp agency to supplement my own search. I told my recruiter that I was not desperate, that I had skills, and that I valued myself. He was a magic man. He would send me opportunity after opportunity, but he would say straight up: I don't think these are what you are looking for but let me know.

He was right. Much of them were your typical shit jobs at shit companies just looking for a warm body to fill an office chair doing grunt work.

Then he saw the pattern, and stopped sending me those jobs and switched gears.

I was getting INTERESTING job offers that I didn't quite have experience in, but were similar enough.

Working in account management at a company that did campaigns for brands (think bobblehead days at sports events) developing new campaigns...

Auditing for a company that did international shipping to find errors or fraud on customs documents of which there was more than I would think...

Then he found me this position that I landed. $22/hr It was to assist in creating a new department in data management. Basically a new manager was given the department and the 2 employees doing all the work and expand the department. There was no training documents, no written procedures, it was the wild west. They liked my ability to find the rental solution and hired me.

Initially the manager wasn't exactly sure where he wanted to use me and initially put me on grunt work. He then noticed that my skills and output were far beyond grunt work and moved me to a much larger more intricate side of the work.

My temp position came to a close 6 months later where he offered me the permanent position. And unlike temp positions in the past he did not offer me less to join, but instead offered $24/hr.

About 1 year later I was promoted to business analyst. Making about 60,000. ($30/hr).

The company had merit increases, bonuses, 401k with decent matching, stock purchase at 5% discount, good vacation/sick...

I was up to 65,000 after another year. And then pandemic.

Despite pandemic and working from home we thrived as a deparent and company. So this October after a couple team members moved on. I asked for a raise. I was offered the jump to 75,000/yr.

So there I am.

A gamer who never went to college with a 2.6 GPA in high school who is now making 75,000/yr. (Granted I am now 46 and it took some time to get there and have a bit of real world experience to make up for a lack of formal education...)

What are you talking about? Diseases have certainly jumped species before (see AIDS).


Edit: Speaking of Occam's razor: A civilization of billions of people eats trillions of animals over the centuries. Other diseases have come from this same practice (see SARS). Is it more likely that another disease comes from this practice, or is it more likely that it came from a disease research facility that (presumably) has safety measures in place?

Anyways, I'll get to my question. Last year I gave a speech on how bee venom wrapped in nanotech could be delivered to a cancer site and destroy cancer cells by starting apoptosis. Due to the limits of my speaking time, I couldn't get in to the specifics about HOW the nanotech knew to get specifically to the cancer cells. Even when I did a research paper for cell bio, I couldn't find much information on how exactly nanotech ""knows"" where to go in the body. Is it looking for a specific sequence of amino acids, or  base pairs in DNA, or what? Basically, when does the nanotech ""know"" it's in the right spot to deliver such medicine? I know you don't specifically deal with the medical side of things, but I figured this might be a basic nanotech idea that is going over my head.

You seem to have a perfect solution to this, which I am waiting to hear. I think we would both agree that high speed chases are inherently dangerous for everyone involved (including innocent people). I'm trying to offer solutions that minimize damages, and are realistic. 

> ""Officer, can you explain why you did nothing to stop the motorist recklessly driving at 100mph who killed 3 innocent people?""

If they weren't actively being chased why would they still be going 100mph+? 

>Don't minimize vehicle theft.

I'm not minimizing theft. But I think theft is no where near on the same level as manslaughter. Items can be replaced. 100/100 I would rather a thief get away with a stolen vehicle than an innocent person die.

username#01046,comment,2020-09-16 16:32,,"1. Honestly, it was many years of trying to piece together what was wrong until it felt right. Klara wants to tell our story today so nobody has to feel that alone until they feel correct again. 
2. No, but they diagnosed all the things co-morbid with it. Dissociative disorders often cause depression, anxiety, BPD, and just about every other damn thing on the planet if you dont know why youre sad and the tools they give you to fix those other things give you no sense of fulfillment. Its like trying to treat a headache with aspirin but its actually being caused by a brain tumor. Mental health is tricky though because nobody wants to be crazy and asking for help was the hardest thing we had ever done because other treatments werent working, medicines and coping mechanisms dulled the pain but werent fulfilling. We havent talked to a professional about this, but we definitely need to soon. We didnt want to because we thought we were a lost cause. 
3. There are only three. Core (child alter), Claudia (introject/sexual/protector), Klara (host/gatekeeper) and we think of ourselves as sisters. 
4. Never watched it. Honestly before last month we were still trying to tackle the borderline diagnosis from our last hospital visit. And our wife had DID so Klara didnt want to resort to that diagnosis right away because she didnt want to hurt her feelings in case it looked like we were trying to copy her. We saved DID as an absolute last resort, or until it was the only thing that made sense. Turns out it was the truth and now we can learn more about it and understand ourselves better.
5. Only one and thats Core! It feels weird using her chosen name but she hates her given name so we stick with Core when we talk about her in the third person. 
6. Klara was the one who remembers most of grade school and middle school but being sexually assaulted by a family member and her closest friend made her fearful of everyone because she blamed herself and told herself not to be angry about it and tried to carry on. She liked writing but after someone she trusted read the diary she stored her anger in, the betrayal was enough that from the 4th grade on our grades tanked and she stopped liking all the things she used to do. And Claudia was born to keep her going through middle school, and she wanted to spend that time making an identity for herself but another event angered her to the point where she couldnt handle it and she was booted out of the body, but we thought we just had the flu and the water in the shower was too hot. Claudia was influenced by Klaras want to be a good person and the want to rebel, but she took it a bit too far and rebelled against everything including people, homework, and taking care of the body. 

(Claudia: and in case you couldnt tell, Klara Fucking. Loves. Writing. she has so much to say but never knew how to say it in the way she wanted. She could probably go forever unless I stopped her. Ive been trying to smoke and eat a fuckin yogurt but she and core wont let me!! -_- Nvm, she says wait my turn.)",AMA

So if you're feeling weird about it, get some friends to all search the house at the same time with you to double check.

My second thing is, the conclusion that I came to eventually is that if there is an intruder in my house making these noises then they are the kindest soul for not slitting my throat in my sleep over the last year, so I welcome their un-presence.",AMA

Since we only recently became more defined (like only a year and a half of integrating into ourselves) were figuring it out as we go along. Only when the system settled was when we started to realize what we as individuals liked, but weve been being broken apart and reshuffled back together constantly for that amount of time and we only settled a couple days ago. Switching is strange, because our introject role stayed with whoever had the body and not a specific person. We had to connect the memories of exactly when we formed, who represented what, what our jobs were, and who we were with trauma related experiences.",AMA

My family's cat has gotten severely ill over the last few months and won't eat or can't keep any kind of food down, so he's being put to sleep tomorrow morning. I've been told I can visit him tonight or go to the vet's office with him tomorrow.

Either way, he'll have a family member with him at the vet's when it happens, but I know he can get stressed easily especially in unfamiliar situations. I don't want that to be worsened if it's stressful for him to be in a small room with a bunch of people.

One day about four months ago I woke up and noticed my left pinky toe was numb. It still had good blood flow. I could still move it. But I couldn't feel sensations from it. 

A few days later, the numbness spread to my left calf, and then over the next couple days, spread up my leg and into my abdomen. When the numbness hit my abdomen I started getting really weak on my left side and was walking with a limp. At the hight of symptoms I had dulled or absent sensation and weakness on my left side of my face, forearm, belly, butt, leg, and foot. I thought this seemed pretty bad so I went to the ER. They did a full-body MRI and had me checked out by neurology, who said everything seemed normal. They shrugged and discharged me and said to come back if it gets worse.

Eventually it just receded on it's own over a few days back to my calf and foot. Now I have permanent lack of sensation in my left pinky toe, and occasional dullness and weakness in my left calf and foot. It's been stable like that ever since.

I am so baffled by this. It's quite unpleasant to think this happened to me and no one knows why. It's a constant annoyance that my left pinky toe bothers me. It makes my foot feel strange and is distracting and distressing. Since I can't feel the toe, I get nervous that it will get frostbite without me noticing because I also have Reynaud's. When I get the dullness and weakness in my foot and calf it disrupts my physical activities.

Any clue what this might be caused by? Prognosis for whether it will ever get better? Thanks in advance.",AskDocs

Vyvanse. After the weird patch showed up I started using Nivea moisturizing cream. No idea if that is really helping but it seems to help.

[This is March, sorry about quality](

[Here it is a few days ago](

[And now it has spread to my nose](

The story:
This has been an annoying condition that's been messing up my face and making my beard hairs fall out. Now with a new patch cropping up near my eyebrow it's threatening to make my eyebrow thin out. 

It started a little over four months ago. In the beginning, hairs started too ooze a waxy substance out of the follicle, coating the hair in it and making them sheathed in the stuff. You can see a few hairs like that in the pictures. 

When a hair gets sheathed in waxy stuff, it becomes really weakly attached to the follicle. A very gentle tug will have it slide right out, root and all, and it will do so completely *painlessly* which is weird. Plucking hairs from elsewhere on my chin hurts like hell, but the wax-covered hairs in this patch just pop right out.

The size of the patch varies. You can see that in the pictures. When it got big enough, the waxy stuff started building up between hairs. Or maybe it's dead skin cells or peeling skin. I'm not sure. But anyway at its largest and most freaky it looked like the first picture.

I had to pick off the flakes in the first picture because it was just too weird to go to work like that. I'd pick them off and then the skin underneath would be red and tender but I'd put some moisturizing face lotion on it, paint some makeup over it and go to work. The flakes would return the next morning and I'd start all over.

Thankfully the time of big cracking flakes seems to be over, but I've still got some buildup or peeling or whatever it is and still got hairs coming out of the follicle sheathed in wax.

I thought this was maybe a hair follicle thing but then it spread to my nose as you can see in the last picture and it doesn't seem to be affecting what little peach fuzz hair there is there. However it is currently growing a new patch near my eyebrow and the eyebrow hair does seem to be affected. 

What the heck is this? I looked up Eggsema and folliculitis but they don't seem to fit. What is the waxy stuff? Why are my hairs falling out? Is this bacterial/viral? Is it auto-immune? Should I go to a dermotologist?

My doctor hasnt helped. The only thing he suggested is cbt which is nonsense because this isnt anxiety based.

The drugs I use to stop it right now is magnesium glycine and other multi vitamins. It makes no difference.

Hi all. My brother was hospitalized with viral meningitis two days ago (Saturday night about midnight). On Sunday afternoon when I found out, about 12pm, I went to the hospital to see him. I walked in his room, asked if he was ok & he said you might need to put a mask on. (He was already on antibiotics & morphine). 

So I stepped out and put on the proper mask/gloves/gown. I was in such a panic I didnt think to put them on before entering the room. So I was in there for maybe a total of 3-5 mins before stepping out & putting all of that on. I kept the mask & everything on the entire time of my visit. Then washed my hands afterwards.

Any medical issues- None
Current medication- None (B vitamins, supplements)

This started about a year and a half ago, (it was a very stressful time in my life) my throat started hurting one day like I had scratched it from swallowing something sharp. The next day it felt normal again. I chalked it up to maybe eating sharp chips or stress and/or anxiety because I was having other anxiety related symptoms such as headaches at that time. 

Ever since then, that has happened with my throat about 5 more times since. 

Yesterday it flared up again. It starts with a lump in the throat feeling, turns painful to swallow for a couple of days, then goes away completely and wont happen again for months. 

It doesnt feel like a sore throat from a cold. It almost feels like my throat muscles are super tight and constricted. I even looked at my tonsils this morning with a flashlight and they looked fine. No redness, no swelling, nothing out of the ordinary. 

Ive tried to think back on anything Ive ate or done to cause the pain. I do get occasional tonsil stones that I tried to dig out last weekend.

For a cat that has had such a hard life due to terrible humans, he has really come out of his shell. It breaks my heart every time I see the little scars on his ears and his blind eye :(",me_irl

You just have to make it think finding a deer to eat would be less bothersome than eating you.

Don't run. While walking calmly away, act tough and aware, like you're fully willing to fight if necessary. Pick up rocks as you walk. Maybe a stick too. Don't look away from it for long. Show it that you are watching it. 

If it approaches stop walking, hold your ground. Shout at it until it stops approaching. If it continues approaching, wave the stick or throw the rocks at it. Scream aggressively. When it stops approaching, continue walking away. 

You want it confused about what exactly you are and what you are capable of. You want it to think you'll stand your ground and fight if you have to. It's used to chasing things that are running away. As a wild animal, it can't go to the doctor and get fixed up after a fight. So it really doesn't want to get hurt. You don't have to convince it you'll win a fight, just that it might get hurt while fighting you. If all goes well it will curiously follow you for a bit, decide you are crazy and possibly dangerous, think ""Eh, fuck that. I'll just go find a deer"" and leave you be.",me_irl

Romeo and Juliet are just the wedge to drive that point home. If the houses had not been feuding, Romeo and Juliet would've been guided by the established courtship norms at the time. They could've been allowed to do the equivalent of officially dating each other if their parent's political grudges hadn't forced them to hide their love. Instead they are dead. 

Shakespeare thinks young love and whirlwind romances are wonderful. Just look at any of his romance plays. In Romeo and Juliet, he's condemning the adults in the play for ruining what could have been a good thing.

Check out this Tumblr post for a better writeup of why the play uses Romeo and Juliet's love, but it isn't *about* Romeo and Juliet's love. It's about the folly of the two families: ",nextfuckinglevel

My wife and I spend about 68k/yr to live off of, and save/invest the rest.  There are some decent tips on how I can cut my spending down.  I look at my life style and sometimes I am in shock at how a household of 2 can live on significantly less than what we do (68k).  

It seems impossible to live like some of ya'll do without scrimping in every aspect of life.  

Cooking every meal, with meal prep, finding the cheapest rent even if that means living in a bad neighborhood, making your own soap / detergent, cutting down on utilities to an extreme, never getting a break because vacations are expensive and no work means less money, taking advantage of every government program you can, only getting clothes that have been donated or hand me down, biking to work so you dont have a car with gas and insurance to pay, etc etc etc.  Some of the things I see in here are just inspiring to see.  I dont have the discipline because Im not forced to do it with life or death financial stakes... and I dont think I could it if I were in a lot of your shoes.

Im also here because selfishly it makes me feel better about the position I am in.

The Between by Tananarive Due is one of my favorite books Ive maybe ever read, and the fundamental question at the core of the plot - what happens if we dont die when we are supposed to? haunts me al the time. The writing is so good and the story is so easy to get into even though its kind of complex. 10/10 could not put down and still think about it today. 

My other pick would be The Fisherman by John Langan. I wont spoil anything about it, but it is a beautiful, creepy, strange story thats ultimately about grief and mourning. I think about it regularly. The writing and storytelling was so good (albeit a little slow). 

Both of these feel like theyve kind of flown under the radar/arent nearly as popular as Id expect them to be. Hope they find some much deserved love from this thread!

Other good choices: 

 Madhouse at the End of the Earth - about one of the earliest Antarctic expeditions that, due to supercritical levels of hubris (among other things), gets stuck in polar winter for several months. The diaries from the crew have apparently been used to study the effects of extreme, prolonged isolation. Not too heavy, really interesting. 

 Brain on Fire - short read, woman gets a form of encephalitis and details her experience both from what she can remember and what others have told her 

 Hidden Valley Road - 6 of 12 children in one American family get diagnosed with schizophrenia. Talks about the evolution of mental illness care and understanding in the U.S.

 The Radium Girls - story of the women who painted watch dials with radioactive paint during WWII and the fallout from their illnesses and deaths. 

 Ill Be Gone in the Dark - true crime book about the Golden State Killer. Excellent read but a big trigger warning, lots of description of some pretty gruesome crimes. Done very compassionately and empathetically. 

 Columbine - obviously huge trigger warning re: gun violence, but its an excellent, comprehensive read about the events leading up to the Columbine shooting, what happened the day of, and the aftermath. 

 The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down - a hmong immigrant family has a daughter with profound epilepsy, details their experience in the American healthcare system. Excellent, excellent read about cultural relativism in medicine.",suggestmeabook

Among more modern literature, I really love Freedom by Jonathan Franzen as well as Peace Like a River by Leif Enger. Freedom is very funny in parts and fundamentally felt deeply relatable to me, while Peace Like a River has a bit more magical realism to it, and does an incredible job of really putting you in the characters world.

The only book on this list that I have read that I might not recommend for an independent reading is The Turn of The Screw. The book is extremely short but is also a difficult read.

username#01087,comment,2021-04-01 19:32,,"Not at all related to the medical field, but Midnight in Chernobyl by Adam Higginbotham has likely been my favorite read of the last few years. 

This book is unbelievably thorough, but also extremely engaging and accessible for readers (like me) who have little knowledge about the hard science of the disaster. Does an excellent job of showing how a unique set of factors (the Soviet government + the culture of communism + the complexity of nuclear technology) created a perfect storm for both the disaster itself to take place, and also for the eventual containment/solution. For a book about such a technical topic that I have no real connection to, I didnt find it even the least bit dry. 

Cannot possibly recommend enough. I watched the HBO miniseries at the same time I read this and loved them both. A lot of the main players in the book are also main characters in the series, which was exceptionally cool and I think enhanced both the show and book for me.",suggestmeabook

Also not sure what your book clubs vibe is, but The Devil All The Time is another of my favorites that was recently made into a movie that has a pretty stacked cast.

Take the master bedroom so you have a bathroom, then rent your other room to your sister on paper. Agree to not actually charge rent while everyone lives happily. In the future if you come to an impasse and have to sell - then your back rent payments will be settled from the sale of the house (whatever they total up to be).

People that hook up with their coworkers have a tendency to continue to hook up with their coworkers even when in relationships. Their morals tend to be on the low side. Typical women in office settings dont usually like the promiscuous women for various reasons, therefore they treat them differently. This is why OPs fiance doesnt get along with ladies at work, but the men love working with her. Men in these groups treat her much better because she fucks them.

For me, I for YEARS avoided the Frozen movies. Especially the first one. It was everywhere. Toys, books, costumes, radio, songs, etc. I couldn't stand it. I was deployed overseas at the time so I didn't get a chance to see it in theaters, so I came back home to literally Frozen mania. And I hated it. I did the typical ""I'm not watching that trash"" stuff people do when they want to hate on something A)Popular or B) they haven't seen. 

So, it comes out on Disney+ and I was forced to group watch both films back-to-back. Now, I see EXACTLY why these movies entered pop culture. I was enthralled from start to finish. Caught myself even humming the songs after the damn movie was over weeks later. This is 2021. I couldn't even imagine how I would've reacted back in 2013, haha. 

""All is Found"" is probably my favorite song and gosh darn does it need more love. The moment they played that song, Frozen 2 could do no wrong.

There's a broad range of opinions, depending on the genre and movie in question.

With that said, mine would be Blade Runner 2049. And honestly, the main reason I say this is because I think a lot of its message went over mainstream audiences' heads. I'm not sure if being more blunt would've translated into a bigger box office success, however, Blade Runner is a slow paced series, and I think a bit more bluntness could've made it more palatable to the average moviegoer.

All I remember was that it required a log in and you had a personal character. If I remember correctly, you could visit different places and there would be other characters. Specifically I remember a beach scene. Maybe a shopping mall??? 

I also remember that there were mini games. I can only remember one that was either like, create a disease or eradicate a disease or something like that. That screen was outlined in red. 

I also remember that my character could have different hairstyles. I dont know if thats important, but Im trying to remember as much as I can. 
Lastly, for some reason I want to say it had wee in the name. However, I also owned a wii when I was a kid so I could be mixing up memories.
EDIT: I think the wee was from another game someone mentioned in comments...

I used to play this game all the time when I was younger and I loved it. Its been driving me crazy for about a year that I cant think of what its called. 
Can anyone help?? Please & thank you!!

EDIT 2: if Im remembering correctly, maybe everyones usernames were with the character too? Like either floating above/below in a black box?

 * I sometimes talk to and associate with power mods despite our disagreements
 * I invited GallowBoob to moderate WRD with limited permissions after he accused the subreddit of harassing him.  The idea here is he would be able to take quicker action against legit harassment (it does happen) as long as he didnt abuse the privilege.  Nobody even noticed that he was a mod until he did abuse that privilege and we kicked him out and reverted his changes like we do with any other rogue mod.

The best way I can describe how I feel about people within any group is the way I feel about people within the car community. A lot of stuff they do can be stupid but it doesn't really affect others and if it stays that way it is fine. I draw the line when they mod cars in a way that makes it dangerous to others.

username#00731,comment,2024-06-28 02:43,,"I think you're confusing 2 different concepts: ""Transfer"" and ""Release"".

""Release"" is what I think youre meaning. This is where a club wants to get rid of a player, but still has to pay said player. Lets say \[Club\] have signed a player for 100,000 a week for 4 years. This tells the player that he can expect to be paid a total of 20.8m (100k x 52 x 4). 2 Years into that contract, the club are thinking ""Look youre a shit player, we dont want you around anymore"", BUT they're still locked into a contract and (at that time) owe the player 10.4m in wages. The club will have to pay 10.4m to the player up front to ""release"" them from their contract. Now obviously they might agree it with a player for a lower fee (""We'll give you 6m, you can leave us and continue your career""), but the player is entitled to hang around and get paid to do nothing, see Jack Rodwell at Sunderland.

Then you have a transfer. A transfer is when a different club wants to buy the player. So same idea, the player is 2 years in/2 years left on his contract, and another club offers to buy the player. This does not mean that the players contract gets paid out, this would be more akin to a club selling *a thing* to another club. The player would agree a NEW contract with the NEW club, which would roll-over-to when he joins the new club, but they're not buying out an old contract. The contract becomes null/void when they sign for the new club, the transfer fee is money paid to *buy the thing that they club owns.*",explainlikeimfive

username#00723,comment,2023-12-02 12:50,,"If anyone is curious about a more detailed answer, read below. I was a symphony musician for years, and am currently working in my doctorate. The answers given are all correct, this is just nerdy detail for the curious. 

There are a lot of violins, fewer violas, fewer cellos, and even fewer basses. This has to do with mass of the instruments, and the amount of air inside of them which allows them to resonate. A bass is gargantuan compared to a violin. You could probably fit 10 violins inside of a bass, to give you an idea of their size. As the strings vibrate, those vibrations travel into the instrument, vibrate air, and then it if the F Holes, which are also significantly larger on bigger instruments. To make up for the physical limitations of each instrument, you have to proportion the about of air being vibrated in each section my multiplying the small ones and limiting the number of large ones. 

Additionally, theres another physics thing at work; high frequencies dont travel as far as lower frequencies.  Elephants can do a low rumble that can be heard from miles away. Birds chirp very loudly right next to you, but cant be heard 100 yards away. Next time you are at the Symphony, if you were to step out to use the rest room, as you come back inside and approach the doors you will only hear some percussion and very low notes, but as you enter the Hall (which is specifically designed to blend and project the sound), you will hear everything mix back together. 

Then we get to the brass section which, put simply, is built different. They are still vibrating a column of air, but its projection point is very small (comparatively), and its vibrating metal instead of wood. Sitting in front of a trumpet is deafening, but standing behind it is fine. Trumpets are placed behind the strings, and are in very limited numbers so as to not blast over everyone. 

Lastly, we have to discuss timbre, which is the quality of the sound that is produced. If everyone in a room is talking, it sounds like an overall hum of noise, but if someone blows a whistle it instantly sticks out of the texture of sound created by the voices. We can all detect the slightest change in timbre, as you can tell your fathers voice from his best friend, even though they are both adult males. The larger the difference in timbre, the easier it is for us to parse. All strings belong to the string family. Woodwinds have their own family, brass their own, and percussion. Each instrument family has similar timbres, and thus need their own number proportions to balance within their own family, and then with other families, depending on the piece being played and the size of the ensemble. 

In the Wagner you described, its meant to be LOUD, and uses a fair amount of high and loud brass parts. To make up for this, the composer has to proportion out the other families to balance that loud brass section, and the only way to do that is to multiply (and they used to be bigger when strings were using gut strings instead of metal!). Wagner is really, really funny to play because of this, though it is often quite difficult on a technical level. 

Hope this helps, and Im happy to answer any questions!",explainlikeimfive

The referee is supposed to add on the time that the ball was out of play at the end of the half.

If theres been more goals, subs, injuries, you might say ""3 or 4 maybe"", big injuries would be a lot more.

But never at work where you're jeopardizing your future and even your employer's likeness. People who need to be high 24/7 are selfish people. ",weed

Look, if i close my eyes and try imagining the most moral person in my life, i think of my great aunt Alisa who is the most helpful, empathetic and unassuming person in the world. She would drop anything she is doing to help a stranger no questions asked. If you try this exercise, I bet you will think if someone decent and good that you know in real life, and not your MOST vocal animal rights or minority rights or _____ rights friend, no matter how laudable the cause on paper.  

Chances are, if you stick a video camera up to my aunt's face and ask enough questions, you will eventually get what HuffPo would call racism homophobia sexism etc etc. She does not read ""the internet"" and has no clue what the latest fashion is in terms of PoLiTiCaL cOrReCtNeSs.

#My name is Chetan Hebbur

###*(it's pronounced like Nathan with a ""Ch"")*, and I am incredibly proud to be in the running to represent District 2 of Manhattan, where I have lived, worked, and gone to school, in NYC's City Council.

---

I am a Dallas, TX native, recently graduating from NYU in Math & Economics, and left my position in Risk Management Consultation to burn through my savings account full-time running for council. 
We are running an entirely grassroots campaign, using money on the absolute necessities, and reserving the rest to donate at the end of the campaign to nonprofit organizations we will vet. I believe politicians should not pretend to be experts, but act as effective mediators between experts in the field and constituents. It is my ultimate goal to fuse the NYC budget with existing nonprofits to use their expertise and infrastructure to solve social problems, rather than propping up new, inefficient bureaucracies. This way, I believe, we can push a more progressive agenda with the budget we have.

---

We believe in empowering the community through agency-creating programs like Community Land Trusts & Participatory Budgeting, to give residents of our District more control over the historical and economic interests of their neighborhoods, rather than development & capital projects being pushed behind the closed door negotiations of City Hall. I want to create an online portal to gauge public opinion on each and every piece of legislation I would have to vote on, and if I vote in opposition to the general consensus I would have to publish my full rationale for doing so. Accountability should be measurable as public officials are in office, and not something we need to scour through public records to confirm years in the future. 
Please feel free to ask me anything about the logistics of the campaign, what we plan to achieve, or really anything else.

#Happy Saturday everyone! My name is Nikkita Oliver. I'm running for mayor of Seattle.
 
---
 
I recently did an interview with Kara brown from Jezebel which goes over who I am, why Im running, my platform, and the political movement happening here in Seattle. 

Article: 

 
Born and raised in Indianapolis, IN. I moved to Seattle in 2004 to attend college. I have never personally set out to be a politician or an elected. I answered the call from community to run for mayor after aunties, elders and youth invited me to be their candidate. This is not a decision I made on my own. Too often have we seen members of disenfranchised communities run for office and forget why they set out to be a public servant in the first place. Instead of changing the office, the office changes them. 
 
As a [Seattle Peoples Party]( candidate I strive to be connected, transparent and accountable to the community who invited me to run for office so that we can transform the office and the electoral process. We need more everyday residents and less career politicians as public servants! I am running for Mayor with the Seattle Peoples Party to continue our pursuit of equity for alland particularly for Seattles youth and disenfranchised communities. It is important that I remain accountable, transparent and connected to the grassroots. I cannot do this alone. The Peoples Party is about building a movement for transformational change which includes supporting and organizing to get accountable community selected candidates elected to public office.
 
Seattle is facing an existential crisis, Who has the right to stay here? As the city becomes less affordable, fewer and fewer of the people who keep our city functioning can afford to live here. If we do not make some key changes in the next few years our city will grow wealthier and more homogenous. 
 
I believe that Seattle wants to be a progressive, affordable, and diverse city; and therein a healthier city for all. Settles wants to be a sanctuary city, a welcoming city, but how can we be a welcoming city if the people who most need sanctuary cannot afford to live here?  Our vision of progress mandates we make strides to put people over profits and center the voices and solutions of the most disenfranchised in our city. 
 
I aim to establish a local government that is accountable to all of Seattles residents but especially to the most disenfranchised in our city. When we pull from the  margins and lift from the bottom the whole of our city is healthier! The lack of affordable housing and the current crisis that has left many in our city living without shelter is devestating. I believe every Seattleite has the right to secure housing and I aim to work in coalition with the impost impacted communities, city leaders, developers and neighborhoods to create a plan that provides truly affordable housing for all. We must also ensure the 10,000 plus residents who live without adequate shelter in our city have the opportunity to come inside and receive the supports the need to live full healthy lives. Additionally, I will work to increase resources for our schools, support progressive tax reform, and fight to protect our citys most vulnerable residents from inhumane treatment such as homeless sweeps and discriminatory executive orders.

###[Hi! I'm Tim Canova, running for Congress in Florida's 23rd District.](
For those who are unaware, I'm facing Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a rematch this year, but this time as an independent. With our decision to challenge the Democratic establishment in an open general election, South Florida is once again the epicenter of our political revolution. We all know how important it is to defeat a career politician like Wasserman Schultz, who rigged the Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses while pushing the agenda of her wealthy corporate donors  from Wall Street Banks and predatory payday lenders, to private prison companies, Big Pharma, and the fossil fuel industry. 

We also recently won our public records lawsuit against Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes. The Court found that Supervisor Snipes violated state and federal laws by destroying all of the original paper ballots cast in our 2016 primary against Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Most egregiously, the Supervisor ordered the destruction of ballots after we sued to inspect and copy the ballots! Because of this, election integrity has become front and center in our progressive campaign. Without integrity in our elections, it will be that much more difficult to ensure progressive victories throughout our country.  

With that said, our campaign is and always will be fighting for important issues like Single Payer Medicare For All, banning private prisons, ending the failed War on Drugs, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, ""mending"" not ""ending"" the Fed, fair not free trade deals, banning pipelines and fracking while converting to 100% renewable energy, and tuition free college tuition. 

Join our campaign at 

If interested in volunteering, please email Tony Dechario at Tony@TimCanova.com.

Small donations are always welcome, since I'll always refuse to take any predatory special interest money or PAC money, at

##My name is Brian Garry, and I am running for Cincinnati City Council. I have a strong commitment to our City, and a passion for our community. 

I don't tell my story that often. Anymore. But I had a troubled youth. I was abused. I ended up with the wrong crowd as a  teen-aged drug dealer and eventually a grand jury issued a sealed indictment for my arrest. Six big guys in suits came to my house and locked me away. When I got out, I was put in drug treatment. Treatment exposed me to recovery but that's not what got me clean. What got me clean was another human being who loved me. When I felt unlovable and didn't even love myself someone reached into my heart and showed me a new way of life and introduced me to a God that I could understand and who understood me and I adopted that way of life- which meant helping other people and surrendering my ego to serving others.
My mentor, the legendary civil rights leader- Rev. Maurice McCracken, showed me by his example of offering my life for the cause of social justice. And I try to follow his example of helping push our society free of the shackles of institutional racism, classism, poverty, homelessness and war. 

I have tried to give back- for the last 34 years- to make up for the damage I did in my earlier years.  I've been arrested several times for just causes- like preventing the Iraq war. Ive been beaten with clubs and punched, maced with tear gas, and tortured while incarcerated- with pressure points behind my ears. They attempted to break my arm while carrying me, then dropping me on my face. More than once Ive been given rough rides while cuffed in a Cincinnati squad car. 

I found a new way of life. I was one of the fortunate ones. Many, many die from the disease that I have. I have been so very fortunate. I have been so richly blessed. I have dedicated my life to the cause of justice and to helping other people recover from the disease that I have- the disease that is epidemic today- addiction.

I was raised in Bond Hill, and am a life-long resident of Cincinnati. I was educated in Cincinnati Public Schools,  graduating from the School for Creative and Performing Arts. I have degrees from the University of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky University.  As a child, I spent my formative years at City Hall. My mother was a legislative aide for Councilmember Charles P. Taft.   My commitment to Cincinnati and our community began then, and has not flagged since.  
I have been a lifelong environmentalist and social activist.  During college, I worked on the Toxic Action Project at the Ohio Public Interest Campaign, focusing on environmental clean-up in Ohio. I reopened the St. Francis/St. Joseph Catholic Worker House, a homeless shelter on 15th Street in Over-the-Rhine, and served as its director. Following college, I returned to the Cincinnati Public Schools and taught music at Sands and North Avondale Montessori schools. 
Today, I am still working to make Cincinnati a better place for everyone. I am now the owner of Green City EcoStruction, a construction and building company that uses green / sustainable materials, methods, and technologies. I have owned this small construction business for thirty-three years, employing between 8 and 12 men and women, many of them second chance workers. 

I have worked in a number of Cincinnati communities, helping each one to develop its own voice and shape its own future. I have worked in the West End, English Woods, Bond Hill and Over-the-Rhine, as organizer and advocate.  As a Clifton resident now, I have worked hard for the Clifton Market and the Clifton Community Arts Center.  

My key issues today are:

1. creating good-paying green jobs, and training our youth to fill those jobs, while transitioning to green energy, which will help reduce climate change and reduce energy bills for residents;

1. raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour;

1. equal economic development in all neighborhoods;

1.  creation of an Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to meet the desperate need for 40,000 affordable units for families in the city. 

All these actions will go far toward reducing poverty, especially the number of children living in poverty.  I have supported Black Lives Matter since its inception, and will continue to push hard against institutional racism.  
As a Council Member, I will work for the creation of fair economic development, homeownership and increased safety. We must create policies that address the root causes of crime not only to create a safer Cincinnati, but also to ensure that the tranquility lasts. We need greater opportunities for education, a cleaner environment, more work force development in sustainable green jobs, and a level playing field in the job market. I will work for unity in Council to create goodwill, trust and respect. My candidacy for Cincinnati City Council is a campaign for positive change for all.

---

#[Hello Reddit!](

---
 
My name is Ruben Major and I'm running for Secretary of State in California. I live in San Diego with my wife and three children. I was running for State Senate until I uncovered numerous and concerning security issues related to our election systems. That was when I moved over to the Secretary of State race.
 
Just to tell you a little bit about myself... I was born to a teenage mother in a dysfunctional home with an absentee father. But don't feel bad for me. When I was 14 I was able to move out and eventually received my law degree and a master's of military history. I have extensive training in counterterrorism which is required to keep our elections secured.
 
I am also a paramedic and the owner of an accredited educational organization that provides Emergency Medical Services Training for a variety of EMS and EMS related programs.

I am running a grassroots campaign from small, individual donations. I will not accept dark money or any contributions from SuperPACs or large corporations.
 
If I am so privileged to serve, I will usher in a new era of transparency in our elections systems that will ensure your vote counts. We will do this by eliminating the vulnerable and secret software which plagues us now and replace it with publicly owned systems and printed paper ballots. 

I'm looking forward to your questions today, so let's get started!

#_On the Issues_

_Ruben wants to..._

>1. Protect and upgrade our election process. We must transition the state from  secret software  insecure election systems to more secure public software / paper ballot systems. This will save the taxpayers billions of dollars while heightening security and increasing voter confidence / participation. We must upgrade our systems from registration to audit and correct current plans to close down precincts or reduce audit capabilities. We must strive to restore Californias position as a leader in the election process community.
>2. Streamline the business filing process. We must maximize technology and create a better, more transparent business environment for California As a small business owner / entrepreneur, I will fight for California businesses.
>3. Make government more transparent. As your Secretary of State, I will work to ensure that we have the most transparent process possible. We will work to make donor information more obvious on the ballot literature as well as the Secretary of States website. We work for the people.",IAmA

Wait so you admit I proved you wrong? You can just say that bro, although your snowflake ego is probably too fragile to admit that youre dumber than the average high schooler. 

And your examples there really say a lot. Benfords law was shown to not indicate fraud in a study back in 2011 (it was worse than pure chance at showing where fraud occurred). 

No liberal goes against the claim that black people commit more crime (the only claim that raw FBI statistics proves) they dispute conservatives claim about what causes black peoples to commit more crimes (and btw the science is on the side of the left in that area). 

And no liberal disputes that chromosomes exist or dictate sex, but the question is whether to recognize people as a gender other than their chromosomes, which science universally agrees is much better for those peoples mental health and actually drives down suicide rates in those groups. 

And as for your last link, multiple MLB players have faced long term heart complications from COVID, so I was right there too. Even in your examples meant to prove that I dont accept evidence youre completely ignoring the actual deeper claims surrounding these issues. 

Youre so entombed in your conservative echo chambers and media that you claim liberals are stuck in, that you dont even comprehend the claims and logic that are being fed to you, your entire ideology is based on projection and oversimplification. And when confronted about it you have no choice but to bring up irrelevant facts and make personal attacks because the actual hard facts are so detached from what you believe.

This comment reeks of ignorant moral grandstanding. Do you think people who are so depressed they are actively contemplating suicide are doing so because they want to? Don't you think these people would *rather be happy* and that they have tried their best to do so?

There are many reasons for this but I do not have time to go into all of that. Apparently, there is not a good enough system in place for this retribution. The justice system is seemingly slow to act and does not bear enough teeth for these kinds of injustices.

I do hope you find extra hours / a job because I do think people can change for the better.  So I will give you advice.

1. Do you have a partner or family that can help provide for you?  If so, lean on them for help, there's no issue with asking for help.

2. Denmark has the most progressive / liberal government support programs.  I know they contradict your views, but you should be taking advantage of any government programs you can, they exist for people in your exact situation.

3. Do you have any online skills?  Do you think you could maybe do something remotely at home?  You have conservative views in a heavily liberal country, there are others like you that feel they are fringe.  Fringe groups can make quite a bit of money if they have a person willing to be the face / voice on these issues that arent mainstream.  Maybe you could get a camera and microphone and start your own social media channel / podcast / following.  It wont pay off right away, but could be an investment in your future. 

4. Get involved with your community, neighbors tend to be more neighborly and helpful when you are a friendly face and a friendly person.  No one wants to help the grouchy guy across the street they dont even know on a personal level.  Try to make your situation more inviting and more visible.

Hope you turn it around.",self

2. ""I have also seen people with non-western names put their pronouns in their signature to avoid being misgendered.  It would be easier to attach a picture of yourself, but that would not let you virtue signal. I sincerely hope you never get a job again.""

3. ""Try to be black in the 60s, openly gay in the 80s.  Nice try.  This is similar to not wanting to hire a communist.  And by all accounts the she/her likely is one.""

4. ""You're unhirable.  Priveleged daddy's woke princess are not good workforce.""

In response to these, dude you think being disabled makes for a good workforce.

Bro your disabled and a strain on society for being disabled, yet your attitude and conservative views directly contradict your situation.  Conervatives would sooner put you down like a dog then pay for you to survive.

Your attitude and disdain for people who also cant get jobs/hours when you are in the same situation shows a complete lack of empathy and disregard for the struggles of others.

Petition: 

**We have recently received good news.** The day I posted this video, the visa office sent us a letter saying they are overturning their decision against Oscar. This means he can re-apply for a waiver, but he wont be home for several months yet. We are keeping the petition going until we have more a more firm commitment from the government. If you have a moment, please sign the petition - I would love for Oscar to return to the Consular hearing with thousands of signatures. Thank you Reddit for your support!

He wouldn't stopped and growled at me when I try to intervene so I had separated them. I went out for a bit and somehow while I was gone the small one managed to circumvent the gate I put between them. When I came home I found them in my bedroom laying on my disheveled bed, calm and acting dogish so I thought nothing of it. A few hours later I went to take a nap and got under the covers only to feel something slimy. I bounced up, ripped off the blanket and much to my horror there was a large goop of what appeared to be dog semen all over my bed. So instead of taking a nap I gave myself a long bath and I now wait while my sheets finish drying so I can go to bed.

TL:DR My skin touched dog cum today.

I had a project tasked with finding a song in German, telling all about the song and artist, presenting the song in the class, and taking a selection of the lyrics and analyzing them. As I'm still pretty new to the German language, I can't understand singing that well, and since I only had to analyze a select portion of the song, I only really understood that small portion of the song. As the song was playing, everyone was seeming to like it, but my German teacher was cracking up in the back and asked if I understood the lyrics. I was confused, as the portion I analysed was innocent enough. She then explained to me and the whole class that it was about a guy trying to have sex with his cousin, and when she turned him down he went to his aunt, obviously I was super embarrassed and turned red. Now everyone in class calls me Alabama boy. The song was bologna btw

username#01226,post,2019-11-13 00:34,TIFU by putting my faith in humanity.,"This happened today, bit of some back story....there is this homeless fellow who I always see outside a local 7-11. He was a super nice guy, always smiling and making small talk before eventually asking for a few dollars. I have no clue if he actually wanted food, but it was probably drugs. I felt bad for the guy though, it can't be easy being homeless, especially in super cold weather. 

Then about a month ago I see him again, he does his little spiel and I say look, I have a bunch of leaves that I want cleaned up, how about you come over and take rake them. I offered some money, he came, did a good job and was super grateful. 

Fast forward to a few days ago, we had a snow storm, I saw him again and he offered to shovel for me. Told him sure, didn't set a date or time, just told him to come over and knock. While I fucked up bad. I am pretty forgetful and last night I carried in a bunch of groceries in the house  and I left my keys in the door. Yeah you can figure what happened. Also I was off today so I woke up and decided to play some newly released death stranding. I wear gaming headphones so I can't hear much outside the game. 

Eventually I get done playing and get ready to go get some dinner, open up my door to a nicely shoveled walkway and stairs and look across the street. My car is gone. I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure he came over, had the best intentions and shoveled and then knocked, but I didn't hear him so he wanted his drugs bad so he took the car. He probably sold it for pennies to get his fix.  I live in an unsavory neighborhood so I'm sure someone took it off him easily. Also time to change the locks.

TLDR tried to help a homeless guy with some yard work, but my dumbass left my keys in the door so he took my car as payment.

Edit: Update, I got a call three hours later, it was the police and they told me they pulled the car over and to come get it. Took an Uber about 5 blocks away and it was parked outside a store. I walked up to the car and the police guy rolls down the window and sure enough it was the same guy I suspected. The police saw the car parked and waited to see if anyone would get in into it and sure enough he did, them they pulled up on him and he go out immediately. He claims that someone handed him the keys, yet admits he shoveled which makes no sense at all, he was spouting off nonsense and screaming he didn't do it. Thank God nothing was damaged, he took a few small things from the console and did God knows what with it. Honestly he needs the be put in jail and get clean. Addiction will make you do crazy things. I am just thankful I got it back because I had to call off work and I would have lost my job.",tifu

For the special occasion, I had blown up a bunch of balloons and let him chase them around. He loved it. He was excited and confused at the same time.

He's got a ton of toys, so typically what I'll do is grab about 10 of his (current in time) favorites. I'll sit down (I have CFS so I have to be careful with my energy output) and I'll play with him. I'll let him have some tug-o-war time, but my primary focus is fetch. This gets him running around a lot more and burns way more energy than what tug-o-war does. When I can tell that he's good and worn out, I'll get one of his treat dispenser toys and fill it with some peanut butter. Typically, while he's trying to work on getting his treat, he'll fall asleep. But it's there when he wakes up and it gives him something stimulating to do for a while.

Thankfully, he's a fairly chill pup and has been since I'd gotten him. Not to say that he doesn't have the puppy energy... but not nearly as bad as any other I've had.

That being said, mind-stimulating tasks are just as important as running around. If you don't have any, I reccomend looking into some treat-dispenser puzzle toys.


Also. There are toys out there that are power-operated and will roll around and bounce on their own. I plan on trying one out myself, soon.",dogs

Should i spay her, what are the benefits and cons to spaying. Is there a significant mortality rate i should be worried about if she goes under the knife at this age? And will her personality change if she gets spayed?",dogs

When we got back home, our 12 year old Shih Tzu had a huge gash on his neck and a bite wound on his forehead (wound on his neck needed 12 staples and the one on his head needed one). There was no blood, ANYWHERE. None on his collar, his bed, outside, under the rugs, behind the couch, in the garage. No blood anywhere. We have a one year old goldendoodle at home but he is not aggressive. If anything, our Shih tzu is more aggressive. We assume they got into a fight but there wasnt any blood on our doodles snout or beard. Another weird part was that our Shih tzu was walking around like nothing happened, he didnt seem to be in pain or anything. We have no clue what happened. Please help us figure it out.

username#01237,post,2015-03-10 13:59,Today I have lost a friend.,"I'll start with a preface, this is my first play through. I started a prisoner, one with a destiny. I battled thieves and bandits alike, making a name for myself. I learned I was Dragonborn, and pushed to fulfill my destiny. I took up a bow and learned archery. I became very skilled and earned a name with the thieves guild. I became a Nightingale, master of subtlety. I killed a man named Miraak, absorbed his power and grew into a force of nature. I pursued Alduin, even into the after life and slew him. After all of this, I decided the civil war had to be dealt with. I joined the imperial army, to help set peace to the land. As I entered, I saw a familiar face, a face that showed me kindness in the beginning of it all. His name was Hadvar. He led me to safety when I was a prisoner and the dragon attacked. He welcomed me as a brother in arms and we slew many a foe together. I fought with him back to back on the battlefield many times. Today however, I have lost a great friend. As we pushed into the battle for Fort Sungard, it was a cold night. I met with Hadvar before the battle. His face was stern and cold but his eyes, they were very much alive. We checked each other's armor as we always did before battle. The troops moved forward, I gave the same order I always did, no one kills until I draw first blood. I pull my bow and look for my first victim. I notice a sentry on the top wall, his flaring torch giving him away, he is my prize. I draw my bow, lining up a perfect shot and release my arrow, in mere seconds it splits his skull, the very bone of the arrow made from previous dragons slain, now in a new enemy, a testament to my conquest past and present. The battle had begun. I pushed into the fort, enemy after enemy fell. As they grouped up, my piercing dragon shout driving fear into their hearts. It seemed like countless hours, though it had only been no more than two and the battle was slowing. The last of the enemy abandoned the now overrun fort and attempted to run, as my arrows rained fury on their backs. Shouts of victory went out, flasks were opened and celebrations were had. I looked around, calling for my friend to celebrate, but there was no answer. I searched for his body to no avail, only being able to assume he fell sometime during the night. Well today the Stormcloaks have fallen, Ulfric fell to the hand of our General. We are victorious, but victory comes at a price. I will miss you dear friend. May you feast eternally in Sovngarde.

EDIT: Thanks to all the wonderful people in this subreddit telling me he was essential. I checked Riverwood and was ecstatic! Hadvar made it home safe and sound and was enjoying a drink as he listened to the bard in the Sleeping Giant Inn. May you have many long days and cold drinks friend, and I hope to protect you in battle once more some day.",skyrim

Not to mention that making abortion illegal usually doesnt help in making abortion more uncommon when people still need abortions and these resources arent available, because people just have less safe abortions illegally.

If abortion is legal, I have the choice to only have sex with women who would abort the pregnancy if the birth control failed.

But if abortion is illegal, I don't even have that choice. And then the only way to be sure I don't accidentally become a father is to just not have sex. I don't want to be a father to an unplanned child when I'm in college aged 20.

I like having sex with my girlfriend. I use condoms, but they aren't perfect. If abortion is banned, my risk of being an unplanned father goes up. It'd make me reconsider having sex at all. And no doubt it would make women in general less likely to have sex with men.

Abortion bans limit my freedom and suppress my sexuality.

Imagine if Republicans drafted a bill saying ""All men's girlfriends will be put in a blender and ground up into paste"" and people were like ""If you aren't at risk of going in the blender you aren't allowed to have an opinion on this!"" That'd be pretty dumb because the republican men are going to have an opinion on this anyway, and I have pretty strong reasons for opposing this.",terriblefacebookmemes

username#00723,comment,2023-01-08 13:53,,"Im a teacher and I have a lot of thoughts on this. One thing to note is that kids spent nearly two years tied to computers and phones, with no other ways of socializing. We know scientifically this stunted brain development and caused all sorts of issues like literal addiction to devices. Its easy to blame parents and what not, but the truth is no one had a choice. Schools had* to stay open or else these kids would learn absolutely nothing for two years, which would cause far more harm than the alternative. I dont think schools went about it the right way, but I think they did the best they could given the circumstances. In order to stay in touch with friends, parents gave them phones, which furthered the addiction process, but also allowed students to have some level of normalcy.

This generation of kids are by far the least social I have ever witnessed, to the point that if you give them time off at the end of class, they barely talk and just sit in their phones. Without getting specific, I teach music, so I see my kids for 4 years straight. I have worked unbelievably hard to try to break the cycle with some success, but the effects will be with us for a while. And I dont blame them. They are a product of their environment.

These companies simply made things more entertaining to everyone* while we were holed up, and its more than just kids who are addicted to the content. But Im not sure I believe it was mal-intent on the developers part, and more the fact that we all got addicted to it since there was nothing else to do. The difference is; adults had fully formed brains and have somewhat been able to shunt the addiction, whereas kids had no choice, and were far more vulnerable to the effects.

All that said, despite how much I hate how addicted to phones these kids are, we can blame lots and lots of things, but (in my opinion)  the primary culprit is the pandemic and the lifestyle therein more than evil tech companies. Remember how much media you* consumed during there pandemic, and then imagine youre a 10 year old with no self control. Parents could have done better, schools could have done better, tech companies could have done better, and society as a whole could have done better. Why are we condemning those that helped everyone get through boredom during the pandemic now, and why werent we upset with them then? Just good for thought.",technology

Not all Germans who participated during the war had the same ideals as the regime itself and were against it. However, that was a different time period and different set of circumstances, but in a sense its almost the same thing. Not all officers agree with whats going on, and are against it, but due to their circumstances they have to stay quiet in order to protect their jobs. They add to the problem, but its the system, gang mentality, and the union that is the real culprit that prevents the change that we seriously need. The officers that were suspended will either be back on the streets in a few weeks or a few months, or if theyre let go, then theyll probably be rehired by another precinct.

A surgeon cant make mistakes since their license is at stake, and they arent protected against law suits. Officers should be the same way, except theyre protected by law suits and they can have multiple complaints against them and be rehired by another precinct or are able to maintain their job.",gifs

username#00822,comment,2019-12-20 06:21,,"(This is my first story here, or ever really. Criticism is welcomed)

  The inside joke between my friends and I, is that no matter what species, or whether it be wild or domesticated, I have an affinity for them. Animals that would have made Swiss cheese out of anyone elses skin, have a docility switch that gets flipped in my presence. At first, I didnt understand it all too well, especially since I could only try it out on animals that were made to be domesticated, like cats or dogs. Gradually though, birds would start to land on my head as I walked home from a friends house, and I even had domain over my sisters *FISH*. Not just letting it wander aimlessly through tiny hoops, either. Nah, little ol Nemo was getting airtime. I know, weird stuff right? But it gets even more weird, and quite possibly deadly.

  A cool Winter night, the day we had let out for Winter break to end the first semester of the school year. We had decided to get outdoors after being trapped in a school building all day for finals. And what better way to do it than doing a little camping? Everyone agreed, but not for all the same reasons. For example, as a good friend of mine, Martin, would put it:

  Fuck else have I got to do? Im in.

   As I approached our meetup spot, everyone had already arrived and set up without me, leaving me to admire their work. 

I apologized, Sorry, I may have gotten the time wrong. Whoops.

  Everyone seemed to accept that apology. That is, except for a relatively new girl in the group, Ellie.

Being late is unacceptable, especially when theres work to be done. Hm, maybe if there was some sort of *device* that tells you the *time* and lets you know when its *that time*. She added on, citing my habit of leaving my phone silenced all the time.

  Yeah if only I had that device I replied in a mocking tone. Seriously, does everything make you tick? Its like your temper is almost as short as you are.

  Ha! If looks could kill, Id be in a million pieces right then and there! 

  I ignored her growl and death stare, and suggested that we get on with our mini camping trip. Nobody disagreed with that, and the nights festivities began. 

  Many hours of telling jokes and stories, looking at the myriad of stars that adorned the night sky that had yet to be disturbed by light pollution, and the occasional song later, it was time to call it a night.

  Well, at least it wouldve if everything went according to plan. And more often than not, plans get ruined. This time, by a curious little brown bear that has probably caught the scent of the food and people, and had decided to investigate. Fear did work its way into my conscience at one point, but it was quickly replaced with confidence in my animal affinity. Even though Id never attempted to use it on a bear cub, it seemed to work. The cub waltzed towards me, and started to scope me out. Nervously, I put a hand to its head, but thankfully, it didnt seem to mind.

  Aww, I think he likes you. I never wouldve though that charm would work on a bear. That comment came from another of our female friends, Macy, who almost never talks, and when she does, its a whisper.

  Me either. Jeez, Im just now starting to calm my nerves I replied.

  But my nerves would be rattled again as I realized what usually follows bear cubs. 

  Yup. Mama bear. And mama bear has no reservations about tearing your throat out if you seem like a threat to her cub.

  As if on cue, an echoing roar, one that shook me to my soul, rang out through the forest.

  That doesnt sound like a baby to me, guys. I heard a voice behind me say.

  A few seconds later, and mama bear was in our sight. And boy, did she look pissed off. Before I could even react, the rest of the group had already hidden behind anything they could find to get away from the threat, leaving me by myself and in the open. 

*Thanks for the help, idiots*, I thought to myself.
   
  Still, I knew I had to take a gamble here, or risk everyones lives. Even if I was unsuccessful, I could still buy enough time for everyone to escape. *Everyone but me*. So, with reckless abandon, I started to walk slowly towards the bear with my arm extended outward with the palm of my hand towards the bear.

Hey, hey... I whispered softly, getting the bear to rest on all fours instead of standing up. Good, part one done. Now, to get it out of here.

  I reached out my hand towards the bear, just like what I had done with the cub a few moments earlier. With a hesitant growl, she seemed to accept my hand. 

  Now, my friends are all scared to death, and I would appreciate it if you could just walk the other way. Please.

  The bear paused for a second, which put me on edge. Not for long though, as she signaled her cub, and dashed out of our sight.

  I had no idea what I just did, but it worked out in the end. My friends seemed to think so too.

I was half expecting you to die!

Please dont do that again.

I-.. Wha-...HUH?!

Woohoo, Nature Boy! Let me hear a Woo! from ya okay?

  I obliged to that last request, and let out the most emphatic WOO! of my life.

Since Dragonite is my lead, I switch out to Kangaskhan... Walrein uses Sheer Cold and knocks it out. Well played, I think to myself. I set Dragonite back in hoping to at least get one hit in before seeing what happens next. Outrage takes about 1/2 Walrein's HP. Fucker uses Sheer Cold again... it hits, AGAIN. No more Dragonite.

Now I'm in panic mode. With a sinking feeling in my gut, I bring out Aegislash to face its execution. In a brief moment of insanity I go ahead and use King's Shield...

The good news? It blocked the attack.

The bad news? The attack was Fissure...

HOLY FUCKBALLS

And of course I can't even set up a Swords Dance before Aegislash faints from YET ANOTHER Sheer Cold.

Julia is compiled and has proper mutlithreading (look up GIL in Python) and was also similar enough to Python where I could just copy paste a lot of stuff.

But so far I'm not really sure if Julia is worth it. It's a pretty small step from Python in terms of code in my experience. Multithreading was fast but wonky, but mainly because I'm not experienced in Julia. Basically if you want your python script to go fast, go to Julia. (or use CPython)

I love how not eating up some revisionist, poor-me bullshit that tries to make the Soviet's into some struggling heroes is ""being blinded by propaganda."" The fight was a team fight, and required everyone to be won as quickly as it did, but that doesn't mean the Soviets were benevolent. 

The Soviet troops paid dearly for holding their front, and they did admirably. But their leadership, and many of their ground troops, were literally just as guilty as the Nazis when it came to the extermination of unwanted minorities in Europe. They don't deserve to be remembered as heroes, but as opportunists that only joined the ""right side"" when they had to, that gave a huge boon to the war effort, a war effort which also would not have survived without the largest form of free military material support in history: some 50-odd-billion.",dataisbeautiful

When used with MIDI the effect produced is similar to vocoding but Manipulator's more unique algorithms give more flexibility to pursue creative sounds with it.    
    
If we take the very rudimentary definition of a vocoder - a carrier being modulated by a modulator then I guess it can be defined as a vocoder along with just about any other form of modulation like FM or RM.

Jeffers admitted possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and was jailed for 10 years.
The two had been engaged in a ""sex fantasy"" when the weapon fired, the Crown Prosecution Service said.

When officers arrived at the scene they found the victim in a pool of blood and suffering from serious abdominal injuries.
She was taken to hospital and required extensive surgery, police said.
'Badly bleeding'
The woman, who was too unwell to be fully interviewed at the time, told officers from her hospital bed that Jeffers was a ""bad man"".
Police said Jeffers, of Berkley Terrace, Leeds, claimed to have found the gun in a pub toilet in Leeds. He said he took the gun to Manchester to dispose of it.
Jeffers was spotted on CCTV leaving the hotel and going to Piccadilly Station to catch a train back to Leeds.
Armed officers raided a property on Amberton Grove, Leeds, two days later and arrested Jeffers.
A search of the house found a partially scrawled note denying knowledge of the shooting, the court heard.
Det Insp Roger Edwards said: ""This was a horrifying incident that has left a woman with life changing injuries that will affect her for the rest of her life.""
He said the crime was ""one of the most shocking"" he had encountered, adding: ""Jeffers left the victim badly bleeding in a hotel room, showing no regard for her life.",MorbidReality

My mom and I are super different, and she had a VERY difficult time letting my sister and I grow up and become more independent (Im 28 now, and my sister is 24). So as she pushes more, I tend to jerk away. Shes not a bad parent, but her behavior feels very suffocating to me and it leads to a lot of tense moments between us when were around each other (we live in different parts of the US, so dont see each other super often). 

I dont know that it affects my relationships, but it does make me nervous to introduce significant others to my family and/or bring them home. I think I tend to be someone who is pretty easygoing, agreeable, etc. with the overwhelming majority of people in my life, and that all evaporates REAL quick when you stick me back in my childhood home.

I went to Di Fara's pizza in Brooklyn and experienced pizza heaven.  Every pizza is made from start to scratch by one guy.  He makes his own pizza sauce, slices fresh mozzarella, and bakes it.  It gets turned halfway, then before he serves it, he tops it with freshly grated parmesan, cuts fresh basil with scissors over it, and drizzles it with olive oil.  The taste is...fresh and complex.  I can honestly say that pizza does not appeal to me anymore after eating two slices of that.

username#01087,comment,2018-10-23 18:37,,"I read an amazing piece about this a while back - though I cant remember where. 

The gist of what was said was that female-female relationships (typically) involve a pretty high degree of emotional processing and support (e.g. I talk to my lady friends about why Im frustrated with work, or how Im feeling about something thats happened to me, etc.) - many of my strongest female friendships involve the kind of discussion that feels deeply emotionally therapeutic and vulnerable.

However, many (definitely not all - its not my intention to paint with a broad brush) male-male friendships do not have that kind of interaction, unless something extreme happens (death, breakups, etc.). So because male-male friendships typically dont necessarily involve emotional vulnerability, the only context that men are familiar being emotionally vulnerable, is in a romantic relationship. 

So that is to say, that I think women in a lot of cases act towards a man who shes interested in being friends with, the same way that she would act towards a woman she wants to be friends with, but men only know that interaction as a sign of non-platonic interest. 

Again - not meaning at all to paint with a broad brush, and I dont think this is true for everyone. But this made a lot of sense to me!",AskWomen

I asked him to stop, and after he left, I dont think Ive ever felt as lonely as I did then. Wed been together 2 years at that point and I felt blown away that this person who was supposed to know me and understand me so intimately legitimately thought that was what would make me feel better, when I felt like I was always painfully clear that talking about a fight or a problem is how I feel better.

So for example, if someone asked me what do I do, I'll mention I'm a stay at home mom and full time student. I won't mention how many kids, ages, names, school I attend, etc. I haven't mentioned how long I've been an at home mom or what I used to do before that UNLESS later down the line I feel they are trustworthy of knowing some of those tid bits.

If you honestly don't feel comfortable sharing certain things or feel like someone is being a bit invasive then take your time responding to then especially if it's online.

I think if you have a western perspective yes, those things seem to be required for quality of life, but we went thousands of years without them and billions of people today live without them. My idea of acceptable standard of living is below most westerners (I have family members who still live without electricity, and yes they are very happy) and we see how many of the comforts of modern life are actually hurting physical and mental health. Happiness is relative, this is partially the reason why many of the most modern societies report the highest rates of suicide and depression.

We have indigenous societies today we can look to, they live happy and fulfilling lives without all the technological advancements. Yes, for a person dying of a specific disease certain advances in medicine are literally life saving. But we have doubled deaths of despair in this country from just 4 years ago and seen a steady decline in life expectancy over the same time.

The one silver lining was that he was a lot more energetic than I was, and was just totally unashamed to be crazy and goofy no matter how embarrassing his behavior might seem. There were times that it was fun to be with someone who was less reserved than I was, and I think in a lot of ways he pushed me out of my comfort zone. 

Other than that though, it was the fucking worst - and even making that seem like a silver lining is a little of a stretch. We fundamentally understood the world around us differently. We had different expectations for what our friendships and relationships should look like, and how the world worked period.

All of them were kind of shitheads (werent we all in high school), but there was one dude in particular in the group that I just fucking HATED. We would fight all the time, and I just thought he was a vile person who I genuinely disliked spending time with. Most of my friends agreed that he was unbearable, but tolerated him because that was just him.

Fast forward almost 15 years, hed married a girl wed also gone to school with and turned out to be emotionally abusive, and borderline physically abusive in their relationship. She finally walked out on him over the summer (praises be). While of course I dont celebrate anyones suffering, theres a small part of me that feels vindicated Im being the only one that vehemently hated this dude for over a decade. ",AskWomen

username#01053,comment,2021-07-29 09:58,,"Excuse me in advance for the long answer, but I have two things. One was that my childhood and teen years were filled with women talking to me like I was the male lead in a sitcom. No exaggeration. Getting that treatment from adults was a weird thing I was forced to think about at the age of 12. It almost felt like gaslighting and there were moments that I did wonder if I was actually that stupid. My mom didn't do this to me but she was almost the only one as I remember it. I don't know how common this is for other guys but I think \*that tone\* is pretty familiar. To be fair these days a lot of guys kind of earn being talked to that way but that doesn't mean it doesn't suck for everyone involved.

The other thing was the way I was treated when I was around younger kids. From the time I was about 12 I started getting \*the look\* whenever I associated with kids more than a year or two younger than me. My mom worked the church daycare in the summer and I had to stay with her there, so those looks and even scoldings from other workers were \*frequent\*. And in my mid-teens I spent a couple years babysitting for the church's twelve-step program for extra cash. But the looks got to be so much that I gave that up.

tl;dr I was treated like I was comically stupid and also a danger to children from an early age and that's probably the root of some of my self esteem issues. I'm not really sure how to fix them other than try not to talk down to people and don't assume all men are pedophiles until proven normal I guess? That second one is grossly prevalent.",AskReddit

I like how a game like Fortnite, Overwatch, etc have made the micro transactions cosmetics. Its still a bit predatory by just straight up targeting children but thats a different story. A game like Battlefront 2 where it was pay to unlock Darth Vader, the most famous character from the series, is just bullshit. There are also other games where its spend $2.99 of real world money and get the best gun/sword/etc in the game or in the case of a 2K buy VC to make your character good or grind for months to be able to make a layup. I understand that the cost of gaming has stayed relatively the same for the past 20+ years, but shipping a game for $60 and then either completing it or giving players with deep pockets an unfair advantage is flat out wrong.

I started seeing a new therapist about 5 months ago, and had never really dove into the depths of my last relationship. A few weeks ago, I ended up telling her a story about my ex that I hadnt thought about for probably a year that kind of encapsulated why he was such a shit person all in one neat anecdote. 

Its been surprisingly difficult to rehash it. I feel like in the last year, Ive almost forgotten how bad things got, and how seriously bad the relationship was.

username#01087,comment,2019-02-17 15:52,,"I read Little Fires Everywhere about a year ago and found it incredibly powerful in regards to womanhood and motherhood. All of the main characters are women who are hugely different and I thought the book did a beautiful job of showing how all of them handled experiences inextricably linked to the experience of being a woman. 

Also - this isnt out yet, but I expect Nora McInerneys book No Happy Endings to be amazing. I find her story to be really powerful not just about the resiliency of women, but the resiliency of people in general. ",AskWomen

I wasn't given much admin to do except taking a register as I was only 15-18 years old throughout my time there and there were two other adults including the Rainbow Leader. 

I really enjoyed it, and the most special part of it for me was seeing all the quieter and shy children grow and gain so much confidence just from their time there and it was so heartwarming to see. ",AskWomen

I am completely in agreement that these women would have been much safer doing a shorter course and, barring any circumstances I cant see from the picture, they arent in appropriate shape to run a marathon.

But at the end of the day, its not my job to shame people for completing their first marathon, a fine achievement regardless of finishing time. I guarantee you the average person would not be able to or would simply refuse to finish a full marathon.",pics
