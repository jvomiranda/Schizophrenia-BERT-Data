I downloaded the file and did what the lively app reccomend but when I clicked it my screen flashed super quick and that had me paranoid so I ran it through virus total and it looked bad to me. I'm not very familiar with virus total or what's considered bad or not so I was hoping to ask here. I am factory resetting it (just got it yesterday so not a big deal) but I want to know anyways because windows sent me there.

Here is where they sent me


And I am including an image of what virus total said. Any help would be much appreciated or just helping me better understand this stuff.

There usually isn't even 100 years of peace in any given area (I've primarily studied North America, England areas though). It feels like if the world continues on how it has been then something bad will come soon. I try not to think of it. I hope we are at a turning point.

username#00390,comment,2024-07-02 05:53:56,,"This stuff needs a lot of work... I had cps called to my house. I told someone that my step father was sexually assaulting me and they show up, we all stay outside and the ask me like 3ft from my step father if he has ever abused me -. - before they even arrived I got a talk and told if I tell them anything they will take me away from my siblings and we will all go to different homes and never see each other again and oh that I will probably get raped in foster care  I'm still really salty because I was 12 at the time and it continued until adulthood when I got away. I often wonder how different I and my life would be if they simply talked to me in private and not next to a pedophile. What child is really going to say that while their being listened to and stared down. Even if they didn't take me away I was worried I was going to get beat if I told the truth.

I've had to call the cops on him too. He would beat up my mother and I. One night when he was really high on meth we locked him out of the house and were scared ofc. I called the cops, terrified that I would have repurccsions for doing that. They showed up to him banging on the front door with a knife saying ""I'm gonna fucking kill you all!!!!"" they did not even take him to jail. He was early 30s by then and they took him to his mommy and daddy's house for the night...this taught me as a child that life isn't fair. They can catch the bad guy in the act and not do shit.

I appreciate all the good, caring cps workers and cope but I've never met one. It doesn't surprise me at all that there was suspicion and checks and not a thing came of it. So messed up. I hope these children can move on to a better time in their life and if they're lucky they will block a lot of this out but I hope they get therapy  I hate that we can't trust the system that is there to help us. As a kid I felt  absolutely helpless and the sad thing for me is that I gaurentee there are so many young people/children who are stuck in horrific situations for this reason.",news

So I know how it feels a bit. It makes me feel better if in the future something very intense occurs again, that I might be able to handle it better than thought.

Personally, I don't think it could send me into psychosis but I think it will cause my hallucinations to get worse temporarily. I'm sure they will feature hallucinations common with schizophrenia in terms of visual. I'd probably be confused on it with auditory ones and not know which ones are the game.

I don't think my visual hallucinations will overlay on the screen because I never have them too bad when looking at screens but looking around the room afterwards could cause an increase.

I'm sure there are millions of women that are affected by it but like me I wonder how many are not and maybe that is why there was not really any talk about it. I know birth control has changed a lot but the warnings and facts about it are still pretty 1950's. I have never actually heard of this being a problem, having never known anyone who found it to be one. But looking back at some ladies I know, it could explain a lot.

username#00393,comment,2014-08-14 14:24:04,,"This is a little long. I once had the great idea to walk across a train bridge. It turned out to be a pretty bad idea. 

My then room mate that I was pretty much heels over head for, now husband, and I were just hanging out and wanted to go fishing. under the train bridge close to our apt was one of the best places. So we hiked down there and found it was pretty marshy. It was not really possible to actually get to where we could even cast. But the other side.....that had a little sand area that other people had obviously been using. 

We were about 2 miles from out apartment. We lived at the end of a street and threw about 30 feet of trees there was a train weigh point. We would always see train stop there and do....train stuff? I'm not really sure why they would stop, but we assumed it had to do with the fact that once they cross the bridge they are in a new state? Not really sure.

So the bridge was about 1.8 miles long, we looked later on google maps. And it was pretty much just wide enough for a train. I looked both ways, it was early in the morning and for some reason I thought, well I don't think they use this that much. Not even thinking about how all the trains get to that pit stop. 

So we start walking. And walking, and walking. And I just happen to look back to see our apartment and I see an engine car. And it didn't seem to make that pit stop. So that was a problem. Well we start jogging, thinking it's not going that fast. It was hauling the mother of all ass. It came around the corner and laid on that horn. We start running. Little context, my room mate was 6' 3"" and I am 5' even and I was not the fittest back then. He was also a track star in high school. So he is totally fine. I see him completely take off. I am running as fast as I can and I have horrible DC shoes on, I was slipping on all the [taconite pellets]( on the platform. Then I saw something I have never see happen before. It was like a move effect where the end on the bridge just kept getting further and further away. I was thinking about the last time I saw my mom and what was the last food I ate and how I never really watched the full move Stand By Me and I just kept running as fast as I could. 

I finally get to the end and I start to slow down just a little. I walk off the bridge and move over on to the grass and just a second after I did the train went past and the wind that it made going past me pushed me down the ditch. We walked under the bridge and couldn't say anything. Once I could finally speak all i could say was how bad I had to pee. And then we look across the street and there, in the middle of really nowhere, is a porta-potty with a sanitary hand washing station next to it. It was glorious. Then we opened the full bottle of UV blue we had along with us and just sat there. We ended up pretty much drinking the whole bottle over the course of the day and then had to walk about 10 miles before we got a hold of another room mate to pick us up. 

Never walk across train bridges.  ",CasualConversation
username#00393,comment,2014-07-14 20:08:43,,"My husband and I got married for a few reasons. We were already in a long term committed relationship. We were at that point already, so once we were married it didn't really feel any different, it just felt natural. We were ok to not get married, but with how things are today, society, being married is a way to kinda show other people you are committed and serious with one person. This might sound odd, but it feel nice to notice people noticing that I or my husband have a ring on. We have been threw a really hard life both together and before and for us, it feel good to let people know we are together and made it threw all that together. I think marriage can be a lot of things. It is something unique to us and it works. The old idea of what marriage is just doesn't fit everyone.

This might be harsh, and I am sorry if it come across that way, but this is just my point of view. My mother wanted nothing to do with me when I got ahold of her. She had her own family and I was nothing she wanted to remember. (not saying thats how you feel, I assume you feel the opposite) But she refused to give me any information about my father. She said he was a bad guy, he beat her, forced her to do things, ect, never wanted anything to do  with her or me. But it's 22 years later. And I have a right to know. I am not sure if I could ever forgive her for deciding for me that I don't need to know my father. How I feel about him is my choice. Maybe he is a dirtbag, most likely in all reality. But I am the one that gets to decide how I feel about him. What he did to her, honestly, I do not care about. I need to know him before I can care about that. And if he did do all that, then I need to deal with that on my own. Because to her he's just an asshole that she wants to never remember, but to me he's half of who I am. 

I would say talk to a counselor. Make sure you have someone to talk to. It takes a long time to heal and make sure you healing. Try to see you son if that is what you really want. As much as it will hurt and bring up the past and as much as you do not want to deal with his father, try to see him. And if you just cant right now, know that someday he will want to know you. I was in a closed adoption and had to wait till I was 19 to find my parents. It's a long wait. Not saying that you would, but make sure your son is never put in the middle. Don't tell him how you feel about his father. I would hope his father would do the same. Showing respect to each other in front of him will be good for him. The second it's parent vs parent he will pick a side. And thats not fair or healthy. 

I hope things work out and you are able to find some peace. I am sorry if that was harsh and I do not want to come across as mean. As the child of a similar situation I just wanted to tell my point of view. Lots of factors go into scenarios like this and obviously I can only speculate.

username#00393,comment,2013-06-03 18:34:54,,"Just because someone is told to pay child support does not mean they actually do. And depending on what state it is they can get really far behind before anything is done about it, if ever. Many many many women never see a penny of child support. There is rarely ever an ""agreement"" for no child support. And if there was it was definitely not set by the courts, so it really wouldn't matter, as you pointed out, no matter what the legal parent wants child support will still be taken. 

It takes a really strong man to step up and be the father for a child that isn't his. He did that and he kinda got tossed to the side like it meant nothing. If someone is there for you for years and helps you in the way you're ""real parent"" should, you should show that person some respect. There is never an excuse for not being there.

Be strong, carry on, and guide them through the rest of the day. One day at a time."" I will never forget one word of that. ",videos

username#00397,post,2022-11-03 15:45:02,I'm crying; because I got my face back,"TW: Mention of mental health

Hi!

I will post a backstory and my approach in the 'end' of the post. I just wanted to share;

I am fat. I am still fat. But I am 25 pounds less fat than 1st of January. Over the summer I noticed that I was falling back in love with my face. I was growing confidence like crazy. I thought it was the confidence, that made me love my features. Today found the pictures; it is because I got my face features back. I haven't had other face features than ""round"" for 6 years. I didn't notice back then - but seeing the pictures - wow. I instantly cried. Both because I am crazy proud of myself for doing a healthy weight loss (Defined: Not a danger to my mental health) and also because I am reliving all the pain I was feeling while taking those pictures. 

But honestly; I just needed someone to tell. None of my friends are overweight, and my family would not see 25 pounds as any kind of success. THANK YOU!

&#x200B;

**Backstory**: 

I am new here. I have always been the fat girl - even as a competitive swimmer. 

Since I began birth control pills at age 14 (for the pain) my mental health has declined drastically. At 19 I began anti-depressants and since a lot of other mental health - medications. (Which has helped me a lot mental health wise! I would not be alive without it! Please don't stop your medications without consulting your doctors!!)

With the medicine came an insatiable hunger. While I was in and out of hospital I was eating because at least when eating I had something pleasant going on in my brain. I gained 110 pounds i 3-4 months. Needless to say I was not aware of any changes in my body. I hardly have any memories from when I was 20-23.  

Now I am 25 and finished university in June - something the doctors told me would never happen,- and I am ... well. I am happy actually and I in love with myself. Like damn-good-happy!

1st of January 2022 ( I know) I took some pictures and videos of my body and I weighted in at 286 pounds (converted from kilos). I wanted to change my body (nothing happened until March). That ED-brain of mine was convinced I would be half that a body lighter at the end of the year. You know the drill...

And now 11 months later I am doing good. No, It was never a good idea for me to lose half my body weight in a year. And I haven't. 

But - I have lost 25 pounds and gained a lot of muscle. 

I did this by;

1) Quitting my birth control in March. 

Without my birth control my mental health fixed itself in a month. I went from going in and out of the hospital to ACTUALLY BEING HAPPY from day to day. Honestly. Fucking crazy. Then...

2) With my doctors approval I scaled down on all my medications. And a few months later I was med-free. My hunger regulated itself. Now I eat 1/4 of what I did before. I have the ability to stop when I am full. I am no longer in a constant mode of starvation-brain. I have learned intuitive eating. That were not at all possible before. 

3) I began lifting weights. Regular length walks with my dog - nothing crazy. (I was already walking my dog - no worries) and also got back in the pool on occasion, when I was needing break from the gym. 

So that is my on going recipe. I am never EVER going back on birth control. (Will say; Every time I told my doctor: ""I fear my BC is making me sick"" they answered: ""BC is not able to do that"" (Which is not correct) - just saying had I known BC was bad for me, I would have stopped much sooner!)

My weight loss may not be fast and extreme, but it is finally working and I am happy while doing so!

Have a lovely day!",loseit

She is not cheating - like I also established. 
Also I am not saying that there is no such thing as women paying for sex work - there definitely is - which is fine also (such as the opposite is fine) but in reality there is a much higher consumption of strippers, porn and sex workers for men than women. 

And you are asking me if you can ask why it bothers me so much. It seems as if you are asking me whether I am a sex worker - which - no - you cannot ask that. But since you asked anyway. No I am not a sex worker.

By telling Mike about her job - you value the fact that men/Mike has the ""right"" to her body more than she does. 

She chose sexwork. She also chose not to tell him yet. I understand why. (Some) Sex workers face a lot of harassment and threats on the daily. Also - the social taboo of sexwork. (Clearly if men weren't to put out a demand for sexwork - it wouldn't exist. She solely markets the demand. It is no different than when you go to your boring a$$ 9-5 job everyday. You market the demand for your skills as well) I understand that ""sex work is different"" and ""your body is a temple - sex is dirty"" is an argument used by some people in this thread. 

But no. It is her body. And she chose this line of work. And you and your friend are upset that she has bodily autonomy and enjoys sex on cam. And cashes in on it as well. Thereby you are implicitly saying that the fact that he might want to ""take part in the deeds"" at some point is more important than her autonomy and her right to chose who to disclose the nature of her job to. You are literally saying that he is entitled to her sexiness - all of it. That her being on cam is taking something away from him. 

I get that sex work is a deal breaker for some people. Ok cool. And then the whole debate on poly- vs. Monogamy - which is actually not relevant since a) it is a job. (You are not in a relationship with your clients at work either) and b) it is on cam - she would not bring him in any risk of diseases or anything. 

You and your friend are entitled.

username#00400,post,2023-12-23 06:06:58,Anticipating an upcoming traumatic event. How much is appropriate to tell my work?,"I work remotely in a middle managerial role in a fairly casual company. The industry as a whole is relatively informal but small and gossipy. Ie, mental health issues are relatively tolerated, but word of any major incident will easily spread to over half the industry.

As a result, I try to be careful about separating any unsavory aspects of my personal life from work. Unfortunately, I have an upcoming medical appointment which will closely mimic a severely traumatic event from several years ago. Following that event, I developed difficulties eating, sleeping, and speaking before ultimately dropping out of school and spending months in intensive recovery work. While I have worked with a therapist to prepare for this upcoming procedure, I am concerned that I may not be in a fit state to work immediately following it. 

I have requested the day off but am not sure if it is appropriate to give my higher-ups any prior warning that I may request additional time off or may be temporarily nonverbal following this procedure. (And if I do end up nonverbal, would it be best to hide it? 90% of interactions are conducted through email, and I can request to use messaging during meetings instead of speaking.) Is it more responsible to prepare contingency plans in case things go very wrong, or would it be more professional to stay silent and attempt to handle any issues in the moment if they occur?

TL;DR: Based on severity of trauma response, I'm unsure if I'll be able to return to work immediately and give it my full attention. What's the best way to handle this with my employers?",Advice
username#00400,post,2021-10-20 03:45:04,Requesting help to limit crotch sniffing for human's mental health,"Hello, dog owners! I have a rather strange situation that I'm not sure how to go about solving. I would appreciate any advice. Apologies for any mistakes; I am on mobile.

My housemate owns a 1 year old male pit bull and labrador mix. I generally like dogs, but as I am allergic and a little scared of them, I have never owned any. I generally stay in my room (again, due to allergies) and don't associate with the pup. He seems sweet, but as he is scared of men, we didn't socialize when he was a puppy and rarely interact now. He seems nervous around me (drooping tail, ears down, shy expression on his face) when I leave my room but will still sometimes follow me around, especially if I am making food.

The issue I am having is that for the past several months, he has begun extensively sniffing my crotch, butt, and upper legs whenever we are in the same room together. I understand that he is curious and means no harm, but touches in this area, even from a non-human, unfortunately trigger  my complex PTSD more often than not. On good days, it's manageable. On bad days, having several flashbacks in the same day can destroy my ability to function and bring me to tears. I am starting to become terrified of the dog and am skipping meals to avoid entering the kitchen if he is around.

My housemate has been less than receptive to requests for any accommodations for PTSD, so I am not comfortable asking her for help. I also spoke to our landlord who is saddened that it has come to this, but there is little that he can do. I am hoping someone on here may be able to give me some advice or point me in the right direction for ways to interact with the dog in a way that will be more comfortable for both him and I. I would love for him to not feel scared of me and to have some way to satisfy his curiosity without giving me flashbacks to some of the worst experiences of my life. Is there an alternative humans can offer dogs to crotch sniffing? Additionally, apart from being gentle/non-threatening and letting him come to me on his own terms, is there anything I can do to help the dog feel more comfortable? 

Thank you for your time. I appreciate any and all help. :)",dogs
username#00400,post,2021-05-14 19:12:12,I have had schizophrenia for as long as I can remember. AMA!,"Hello! World Schizophrenia Day is May 24th, but as I will be busy then, I wanted to do this a few days early.

Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness wherein the person with schizophrenia has trouble accurately perceiving and interacting with reality. This manifests in symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia, but also in symptoms that affect functioning ability like the loss of pleasure, the inability to emote properly, or speech issues. Many people with schizophrenia also experience cognitive deficits such as issues with memory, attention, or problem solving. 

Everyone's experience with schizophrenia is different, but most people develop this illness in their teens or adulthood. Some, however, exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia from early childhood and are known to have early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) or childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS). Childhood schizophrenia is often very frightening and confusing for the child, and unlike most other people I know with schizophrenia, I don't remember a time ""before"" my psychosis.

Despite being a very serious disability, people with schizophrenia can and do lead fulfilling lives when presented with the right support - be it medication, therapy, coping skills, a support network, or a combination of multiple support types. I (21M) work full time in education, study for my Bachelor's degree, and translate on a daily basis as a hobby (and soon, I hope, as a career). I have wonderful friends and, with some limitations, can lead a similar life to most other young people in my area.

However, a huge roadblock in the life of people like me is the stigma around schizophrenia. Shame and a misunderstanding of what schizophrenia is leads many people to avoid ever seeking treatment or acknowledging their illness, and those that do receive treatment face medical discrimination at a significantly higher rate than the general public. People with schizophrenia often have trouble seeking employment or finding life partners. Furthermore, studies have shown that up to 75% of the surveyed population would feel uncomfortable in the sheer presence of someone with schizophrenia. This widespread discrimination hinders people with schizophrenia from living their lives to their fullest extent. Therefore, I am here today to answer any questions you might have about schizophrenia or my experiences, no matter what, so you can gain a better understanding of the kinds of things people like me go through on a daily basis.

username#00400,comment,2021-05-15 02:06:35,,"I would say they can both be bad but in different ways. They usually feed off of one another.

As a child, I believed that I was an inhuman spirit born into a human body with the sole purpose of fighting with other spirits for the control of the universe. ... I guess this is the kind of thing you think of when you're 4. However, this meant that I was always scared of my ""enemies"" trying to kill me, and I hallucinated myself as both victim and instigator of horrendous amounts of violence from a very young age. Additionally, as I was supposed to be inhuman, my hallucinations punished me for anything that was deemed too human that might be harmful to our cause. I wasn't supposed to let anyone catch me eating or sleeping, even though, quite naturally, that is necessary for all children. As a result, I was undernourished and often sleep-deprived for many years until I started being left alone more in my teens. I also wasn't supposed to make friends or other emotional attachments due to the fear that they might be used against me; in general, I was supposed to avoid feeling or expressing emotions as well. The punishments the hallucinations used for breaking any of these ""rules"" were fairly benign in my early years - such as kicking and slapping in early elementary - but progressed all the way up to physical torture and sexual violence by high school. The net result of all this was complex PTSD, stunted physical growth, and a whole lot of complex issues to work out over the past few years haha. Once my main delusion ended, I had a very hard time suddenly adjusting to a world where only school, the future, and friends mattered. Me? Having a personal future? Not simply being a means to an end? It was unthinkable. I didn't view myself as a person for a long time, and I still somewhat struggle with that to this day.

To answer your second question, I tend to ramble a lot... as can be seen above. I also struggle with speaking out loud and strongly prefer reading and writing.",AMA
username#00400,comment,2021-05-15 01:52:45,,"Over the years, the nature of my delusions has changed a lot. Nowadays, delusions are usually short-lived, lasting anywhere from a few hours to two or three weeks. I can recognize them as a kind of faulty thinking which, while very distracting, are ultimately ignorable if need be. They can feel either negative, such as believing that social media followers are plotting to kill me, or positive, such as believing that the author PKD left a secret message for me in a book that only I can uncover.

As a child, my delusions lasted for longer and were more fantastical. I remember a period of about a month when I was 11 where I firmly believed that I was an alien from Venus put into a human body. Delusions like that would eventually be forgotten about, more or less, and swept under the rug to make way for my main delusion. I completely believed up until around age 15 that I was a powerful spirit trapped in a weak human body. As this spirit, it was my duty to fight in a cosmic war against other spirits for the sake of claiming the universe as my own. This sounds cool in theory, but in practice it meant that I lived in constant fear of my enemies trying to kill me or hurt me. I was also afraid of making friends or loving my family members due to fear that they could be used against me, and the knowledge that, an ""inhuman being"", was supposed to be perfect brought me a lot of shame. My hallucinations punished me heavily for making mistakes, and I sought to repress my urges to eat, sleep, and emote like normal people do.

username#00400,comment,2021-05-14 21:57:12,,"Generally speaking, my experience has been extremely unpleasant. As a child, I lived with constant delusions that I wasn't able to break out of until my mid-teens. The shock that I felt is hard to describe. I had a very hard time adjusting to a completely new reality. Suddenly, things I never cared much about (school, friendships, life as a human being) were the only things I had, and my purpose for living was gone. I struggled a lot with depression over the next few years. Additionally, the hallucinations I experienced as a child were very violent, and that plus constant delusional thinking of being inhuman left me with complex PTSD. To this day, I am still struggling to undo the effects of that volume of violence and abuse, but my life is overall infinitely better. Being able to function as a normal person without fear of being killed, tortured, or violated at any given moment is a freedom that I never imagined in my wildest dreams as a child.

My family used to walk on eggshells around it, but I don't speak with them much. My father recently opened up to me about some psychotic experiences he has faced throughout his life, and I am grateful that he is sharing it with me. I hope that he will be willing to look into a therapist sometime soon, as this secret has been bothering him greatly. For other close personal relationships, most of my friends are absolutely wonderful about it. I try to manage my illness myself whenever possible, but many of them provide at least some emotional support if I need it. Others have stepped up and helped in other ways, such as helping me find housing or physically removing me from a triggering situation during a flashback. I'm incredibly grateful to all of them.",AMA

While schizophrenia likely has a genetic component, no one knows for sure what causes it. Having family members with schizophrenia can increase your chances of developing the illness, but the chances are still low. Stress is another factor thought to increase one's chances of developing schizophrenia (and anecdotally, it always makes my symptoms worse), so take care of your mind and body as best you can. If you do eventually feel that you may be exhibiting symptoms such as hallucinations, a cognitive decline, or a loss of executive functioning, please see a doctor. The laws may differ depending on your country, but for most places, you will not be involuntarily hospitalized unless you are considered an active threat to yourself or others. 

I strongly recommend against taking APs without a doctor's approval. APs frequently have extremely unpleasant side effects. I, personally, don't use them anymore for this reason.",AMA
username#00400,comment,2021-05-14 19:56:26,,"Good question! A concern I see come up a lot is the myth that people with schizophrenia are inherently more violent or irrational than the general public. While some research does indicate that people in psychosis may be more likely to be violent than someone not in that state, this ignores other elements such as people with schizophrenia facing higher levels of being abused or struggling with alcoholism / drug abuse than the rest of the general population. Generally speaking, a person with schizophrenia is much more likely to be the victim of violence than the perpetrator.

When a person is in a psychotic state, they are unable to perceive reality in the same way that everyone else does. On its own, this can be frightening and frustrating, but psychosis can often manifest in terrifying ways itself. For example, if I am hallucinating someone chasing me with a knife, it would take a great deal of courage to sit in place and let the hallucination attempt to kill me. More likely, I would get up and try to run away, which may involve pushing past someone in the process. Does this mean that in normal circumstances that I push people around unprovoked? Absolutely not. 

In short, I wish people would approach us with more sympathy and ask to hear our sides of the story. No one else can experience our personal realities, but an understanding, empathetic ear goes a long way to helping us feel less alone in frightening situations.",AMA

It's not. 

The meds are no different than meds for anything else. I've had a worse reaction to Benadryl than I've had to any antipsychotics or atypical antipsychotics. Schizophrenia isn't the worst brain disorder there is. Personally, Derealization Depersonalization Disorder is way worse. 

I've got a home, a family of my own, and I've publicly spoken on the topic of schizophrenia several times; Schizophrenia is nothing to be afraid of. It's manageable. We exist. 

Personally, the stigma behind this brain disorder and the fear mongering from Hollywood is what makes being diagnosed with schizophrenia scary.

I've been out of work since August `21 and surviving with children off of EBT, WIC, and LIHEAP alone has been an absolute *nightmare.* 

We don't get ""spare money"" and if we do - I have to get rid of it immediately otherwise we lose our EBT & Medicaid benefits... but in all honesty it's not like I EVER have even $30 of spare money to sit on seeing as we have zero income. 

For example: Pell grants can work against you if you're applying your children for Early Head Start/ Head Start child care centers! The government considers Pell grants and scholarships as income, even though it goes directly to your education and living/child care expenses. 

Local community food pantries and community churches are legit the only way we've survived post child tax credit payments. Sometimes you have to wait 4+ hours just to even have your tag number called at the food pantry, too. I've had to leave empty handed before and those are legit frustrating days...

I'm only 80% of the way through the process of qualifying for SSI/SSDI and I have *several* qualifying disabilities... I'm also incredibly proactive with my SS case manager to make sure that their office has ALL of my medical records, after learning that they hadn't even pulled the substantial chunk of records from a specific doctor (that diagnosed me with a qualifying diagnosis) due to ""human error"".

I quite literally made only $4.5k the year prior to applying for SSI/SSDI, and *even that works against my case.*

**The whole system is totally FUCKED.**

You're either trapped in a 'no income, completely dependent on government assistance' situation with little wiggle room for anything that isn't a 'tiered necessity', or you're trapped working 2 to 4 jobs just to scrap by on 'survival mode', especially with how inflation has taken effect post 2020.

It's not a fun situation to be in and I'm lucky to even be in the position I'm in now in all honesty, as I've been trying to get SSI/SSDI since mid 2019... *Appeals based off of denials over late paperwork are a bitch.*",news

username#00403,comment,2022-04-12 12:10:02,,"Oh my...

My dream state, at times, can be beyond vivid and confusing - but it's only with night terrors and sleep paralysis that I take an extra moment to process reality and my place in it. 

The atypical antipsychotic that I've been on for 7+ years consistently has melted away the barrier of thought/paranoia that questions which ""state"" I am in (dream state verses waking state). 

I've never gone that far into dream delusion, as said Alzheimer's patient, but Alzheimer's is a beast all of it's own - and within it's own right.

Schizophrenia full blown delusions evolve with age, sometimes lessening with experience in psychosis, consistent medications, and mental willpower via CBT & DBT psychotherapy (you begin honing the skill of reality checking yourself - for example: I used to wear rubber bands to snap myself whenever I felt delusional as a teenager). Though, now that a few decades have gone by while living with Schizophrenia, I now find myself better able to distinguish between delusional thinking and fact based thinking; it's taken a lot of dedication, education in psychology and psychiatry, and honest ""elbow grease"" via CBT & DBT psychotherapy over a periods of weekly hour-long sessions **for years.**

My mother, towards the end of her life (she died of liver failure due to alcoholism), was Schizophrenic and had no control over her delusions; she was at the whim of her creativity and dreams. She had multiple episodes of confusion, like said Alzheimer's patient, but that was likely compounded by the build up of hefty toxins in her organs (due to the prolonged liver failure).

I reckon that a Schizophrenic's ability to adapt greatly is dependent on their overall health and well-being, their diet, and their lifestyles. *The better, healthier ""canvas"" you have to work with - the cleaner/clearer the painting then is able to become with twice as less effort...*

 I lead a prominently raw vegan (dairy allergy), no-artificial-sugar/sugar-free lifestyle, never smoked cigarettes nor never drank heavily - nor is alcohol a part of my life in all honesty, I used to exercise and go to the gym routinely (prior to heart failure), and I regularly see my PCP and correlating Specialists for routine monitoring. The only ""unhealthy"" habit I have really is moderately drinking diet soda, but caffeine is a bitch to get off of and I'm still on that ""hill"". 

Through all of these lifestyle changes I have found that my Schizophrenia is easier to manage than when I was eating processed foods, high artificial sugar foods, and when I was not maintaining a sleep routine of 8+ hours nightly. **The more stress the physical body is in, the more stress the psyche is in; remove stressors and psychotic symptoms lessen.

I have an obscene amount of allergies, some life threatening (morphine, benadryl), and most else being gastrointestinal agitators and skin irritations (gluten, dairy, dander, pollen, perfume, color dyes, etc...).

There's legitimately no advantage to a psychotic brain disorder, and the thought process navigating that agenda (advantages to Schizophrenia) is typically that of one experiencing unmedicated Psychosis. 

Anyone with a psychotic disorder will tell you that any episode of Psychosis involves a hefty amount of mental gymnastics in rationalizing our disordered behaviors to ourselves as ""ordinary"" and ""normal""... 

We'll grasp at ANYTHING in order to excuse our behaviors, including thinking that not taking our antipsychotic, prescribed medications makes us stronger, more creative, and ""more free"" - but in reality most of us end up at rock bottom, in a ward, a week or so off of our antipsychotics because we cannot distinguish society's preferred reality over our own disordered, paranoid reality. 

And it's NOT because we're weak, but rather because we lack the adequate neurotransmitters (dopamine and serotonin) to function rationally. It's all chemical. 

Unless you're neurodivergent - you'll never understand what an honest struggle it is to be ""functioning"" at society's standard. Schizophrenia is an evolving beast that you have to learn how to tame and regularly ""calm""... **It's not a fun disorder to live with by ANY means.**",science

Will continue to do so when we're downgraded Defcon level. 

I'm far enough away from a major city to survive the initial blast. I've had fire blankets and fire gloves, alongside fire extinguishers for a while now, but I stocked up on water, rice and beans, and canned food today. I've cleared out a middle room in the core of my home to hide in - *if we even get a warning...* Oh and I've gathered an emergency first response kit with flashlights, knives, and some spare, thick blankets to cover us in pre-blast (to better protect our skin).

I've read up on ready.gov's nuclear pages, alongside the CDC's nuclear page, and I have read more than my fair share of tips and rules about nuclear winter.

My biggest fear is that my toddler will survive the blast, *but I won't* - there'd be no one to care for him and he'd die alone, *terrified.*

you can buy a dog in a shelter. you cannot replace your family member and the nine months of gestation, preparation, and the subsequent eighteen years of preparation (and execution!) of childcare. 
regardless of their impact on your life or their purpose (or even job as a service animal, coming from a blind person) could ever replicate the depth and potential of a human's life. 

sometimes accepting that your viewpoint is flawed & not acceptable is important to understand dissent. almost nobody is going to agree with you that an animal has priority over a child, even if the child is not a direct descendant. if someone saved a dog instead of you, wouldn't you be offended as something that has a lifespan of 8-9x its expected healthy range? 

in this hypothetical scenario, you deny a child its volition to become its own individual by prioritizing an animal which can be easily acquired, even with adoption processes by shelter. people disagreeing with you has nothing to do with ""downplaying"" the emotional impact of an animal; it just comes from acknowledging the validity of a human being allowed to develop in the stead of an animal that outnumbers us 5.1:1 (according to the NIH). 

most people (including myself) would agree that an person is vastly more important than a companion animal, even moreso now that humanity itself does not rely on animals like dogs to survive (in the way we formerly did with things like hunting dogs and retrieval animals, or even herding animals). 

people are going to interpret your viewpoint as unnecessary misanthropy. there is nothing you can say or do to combat this, because humans are innately programmed to protect other human beings. also, please stop leaving your cats outside if you truly care about them. research the rates of infection of deadly or transmissible diseases in outside cats vs. outside cats, and their environmental impact on local native wildlife. keep your cats inside to make them suffer less, as you seem to care about animals quite a bit including your partner. indoor cats live significantly longer due to not being exposed to the respiratory issues presented by fauna and prey animals (which are usually animals SUPPOSED to be there for biodiversity, which cats directly impact in almost every area they're introduced as an invasive).",relationship_advice

I can somewhat control the way I feel towards others, since calm responses to sound stimuli can be guided with thought. While my perception of other's attitudes towards me is dependent on their actual attitudes, it can be further influenced by my own self-perception.

Even tho I can minimize how much I might hate anyone, it is more difficult to minimize how I perceive others perceiving me. And to do so might even be against the truth of it, so ""no"" to that.

Generally, I try to accept my feelings about anyone and justly accept anyone's feelings about me. And that doesn't mean I won't stand up for myself or acknowledge my shortcomings, because that's kinda the point? Let's be honest here.

>Meditation ... is training your attention to achieve a mental state of calm concentration and positive emotions. Mindfulness is one of the most popular meditation techniques. It has two main parts: *attention* and *acceptance*.

>The *attention* piece is about tuning into your experiences to focus on what's happening in the present moment. It typically involves directing your awareness to your breath, your thoughts, the physical sensations in your body and the feelings you are experiencing. The *acceptance* piece involves observing those feelings and sensations without judgment. Instead of responding or reacting to those thoughts or feelings, you aim to note them and let them go.

>To try PMR:

>1. Find a peaceful and quiet place to do the exercise. Sit in a chair or lie down on the floor or a bed. If it feels comfortable, close the eyes.

>2. Keeping the mouth closed, inhale deeply and slowly through the nose. Exhale slowly through the mouth and imagine tension leaving the body.

>3. Repeat these deep breaths three or four more times. If it causes dizziness, breathe normally instead.

>4. On the fifth inhale, squeeze the muscles in the toes and feet and count to four. Then exhale slowly through the mouth, gradually releasing tension from the feet.

Ancient Greece gave us proto-science in the earliest known schools of natural philosophy. The Temple of Apollo at Delphi was centrally located on neutral ground and the destination of many pilgrimages for healing and divination from the Oracle. It was Apollo's first temple, a neutral god who most relevantly governed truth, knowledge, and prophecy.

Carved onto the front of the temple were the threeDelphicmaxims: ""*Know yourself*"", ""*Avoid extremes*"", and ""*Surety brings ruin*"". These aphorisms were attributed to the earliest Greek philosophers who lived centuries after the temple's founding and centuries before Aristotle.

Variously translated, I think the gist of what they each said still rings true for a broad swath of decisions. But I'd still put each of them in support of any reasonable Virtue.

>This is a complex and controversial question that different Christian denominations may have different views on. In this context, a human might say that it depends on whether you believe in **eternal security** or **conditional security** of salvation8.

>Eternal security is the belief that once a person is saved by faith in Christ, they can never lose their salvation, no matter what they do or believe afterwards. Conditional security is the belief that salvation can be lost if a person commits **apostasy**, which means to abandon or renounce one's faith in Christ8.

Incorrect. You seem to be conflating belief with knowledge. It's often discussed in epistemology. The mere question of belief in the ignorance of knowledge is apoplectic as it restrains perspective to the individual agent. But perhaps I presuppose too much. My whole point is that the two concepts about qualifying the veracity of any information, belief or knowledge, either or both or neither, is subject to the whims of self bias, one way or another. The system determines the output.

So, what do you (dis)believe or (un)know? ;)",atheism

Being confident that people make up stories and that all the religions of the world cannot agree ontologically about what is beyond contemporary science, with much contradicting empirical understanding, that's not faith either. It's reasoning from evidence. 

If trusting ones senses, experience, and reasoning about that, is faith, then your definition of faith seems to be conflated with any belief. If all beliefs are faith, then belief in empirical reality is indistinguishable from faith in any ontology, whether it is true or not.

So if I'm reading your definition correctly, faith can be false and pushing faith itself on us is no better than telling us to be confident in our beliefs, whether they're true or not. Sounds dangerous.

Faith is trusting something to be true while knowing you haven't proven it. It's accepted belief in the face of a critical lack of supporting evidence.

Belief is any information accepted as true. Defining knowledge gets tricky because it must be true to qualify as knowledge but verification of that can elude us, to varying degrees, so we try to justify it by various means. But certainly not by means of confidence alone, such as faith. It's the objective nature of knowledge which we all strive for when interacting with reality. So is it any surprise that faith can drive us mad?

How can I be sure of that? Are *they* even sure of that? Euphoria can be manufactured with sufficient mental discipline sans religiosity.

Or could it be that they're lying about ""feeling"" anything at all like what ""the holy spirit"" ostensibly bestows?

The onus in truth seeking is on each of us to determine accurately and share with integrity. Whereas faith abstains from skepticism and abandons truth seeking to rest in the illusory comfort of an unfounded all-purpose explanation, e.g. ""the holy spirit"".

State troopers and other nearby authorities then intervened in an attempt to break the two up, all of which was caught on nearby cell phone and body camera footage.[21][22] Harris later stated to officers that Lambert had approached him in an 'aggressive manner' and that ""I instinctively put my hands on his chest to keep him from bumping into me, which I felt was inevitable if I had not protected myself"". Lambert was eventually moved out of the gym and then forced to the ground and arrested.[23][24] He was charged with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct and released later in the day.[25][26] Governor DeWine decried the event by lambasting the actions of authorities stating that Lambert ""had the right to be reporting"" and condemned any obstruction from authorities upon the press by asserting: ""That certainly is wrong and it's not anything that I approve of.

From a constructivist perspective in doxastic logic, both certain belief and certain disbelief are unattainable under a suspension of judgement about necessary unknowns. The ultimate nature of everything is unknown, unknowable, and thereby necessarily indeterminate.

Beyond Russell's teapot, consider the omni-* nature of the typical, hypothetical creator god. In constrast, we are infinitesimal, limited beings with only finite, subjective, potential knowledge. 

While we might infer best guesses about unprovable unknowns, e.g. that ancient cosmologies were at best well-intended guesswork and at worst intentional lies, our guesses remain neither proven nor disproven. 

To adopt certain beliefs from credences given significantly incomplete information, despite our best efforts to contextualize around the facts in question, is nonetheless overreaching and fails to obtain in much the same way as our hypothesizing about the origin of religions can trend when logical rigor is lacking.

So we should be careful that our myths of myths are understood as such. They are ultimately indeterminate, despite our best efforts, and therefore indefeasible, empirically and rationally.

Functionally, they're both making the same observation by way of slightly different metaphors to demonstrate a metaphysical theory (unobserv-ed/-able). The exercise being, sans conclusions, to imagine by proxy that there could be another unobserved level to reality above what we have heretofore experienced.

Where you land on drawing conclusions from such a thought experiment will depend on your other logical commitments. Can you accept that which can only be rationally imagined as possible but not evidenced (defeasibly, up to irrefutably) by any empirical sense? If not, to what degree might you assent to credal or pignistic knowledge for any instance of such speculation?

Is there something beyond what we can see etc? Maybe. Could it be substantially different in nature to what we are aware of with certainty? Perhaps. It remains unknown. Should we derive certain belief from unknowns? 

We have repeatedly in the past expanded the range of our observations in substantive and categorical ways via technological advancements. Technology is driven by reasoned means founded with iterative causal inferences under the auspices of the sciences. The well proven track record of that alone tells me that our best bet to see beyond the horizon, for what it actually is, is to continue to promote sound scientific endeavors.

Religions are mostly ossified with specifically imagined possibilities that only exist beyond what is observed. Made worse when they claim they are observable without merit. Their dogmas result in hyperspecific guesswork, codified into wholistic philosophies and ways of living, marketed and sold with so much pseudo-rational stories that too often disconnect the devotees from actual reality in which their reasoning and impact is actually causally linked, and not just fallaciously imagined to be.

A few years back I was a temp worker for the county leading up to and after the general election, so I learned a lot about the process there. Since then I've tried to stay on top of understanding the voting process, particularly mail-in ballots, which is how I've voted since the 'no reason needed' policy started.

A niche point of interest for me on the topic is that there doesn't seem to be any official policy on which date formats are specifically allowed or disallowed for the outside envelope. They just look for it to be legible and correct. So while common sense makes it *mostly* a non-issue, if handwritten dates continue to be a requirement I'd like to see some clarification on that going forward. 

Honestly, I'd prefer to use ISO 8601 format (yyyymmdd) but I realize that's not one of the commonly recognized formats for handwritten dates (I've used it as a file naming convention for decades). All that said, I find that requiring ""today's date"" on mail-in ballots is an unnecessary barrier to our civic duty, which only serves as a defective tool to reject otherwise valid votes.",WhitePeopleTwitter
username#00415,comment,2022-11-08 15:03:32,,"Apart from being substantially illegible. In general, mistakenly putting down their date of birth is perhaps the most common one. Second to that would be writing the previous year, less common in November than January but it still happens. Another occasional ""incorrect date"" is to use European formatting, particularly on such dates when the difference is indeterminable, e.g. 11/8 (Nov 8th) written as 8/11 (Aug 11th?) versus 10/31 (Oct 31st) written as 31/10 (should be able to tell that's just European format). 

That's just my understanding of the kinds of most likely incorrect date cases happening here. I don't know for certain except to say that requiring ""today's date"" to be handwritten is realistically unnecessary and shouldn't be part of any barrier to voting.

And as I understand it, there's no official ruling on which date formats are acceptable or not ... but a county election worker (Allegheny) told me they're accepted so long as the date is legible and correct, that's all they're looking for. So it's just relying on common sense for which format to use, I guess.

The confirmation online is pending until they've received it and then only shows that they've received it. No one knows how anyone voted their ballot yet except the voter.

Apparently some got calls for failing to use the inside ""security"" envelope, which is required to protect voter anonymity. Others for incorrect dates (mistakenly putting their birthdate is a historic typical cause there) or being undated or lacking a signature on the outside envelope. I'm not seeing anywhere else reporting about people being kicked out of line, although if true, isolated disruptive behavior seems a reasonable explanation to me.

>In the 1980s, then-owner A. Alfred Taubman launched the ""Third is the Word"" campaign to promote A&W's new third-pound burgers and compete with another brand's smaller quarter-pound burger.

>Taubman recounted this example in his book, Threshold Resistance.""We were aggressively marketing a one-third-pound hamburger for the same price...but despite our best efforts, including first-rate TV and radio promotional spots, they just weren't selling.""

>Confused why A&W's burgers weren't able to compete even though the burgers were priced the same as their competitors, Taubuman brought in a market research firm.

>The firm eventually conducted a focus group to discover the truth: participants were concerned about the price of the burger. ""Why should we pay the same amount for a third of a pound of meat as we do for a quarter-pound of meat?"" they asked.

Which is to say, any possible evidence of a purportedly supreme being (e.g. God) would be infinitesimal relative to the entirety of it and any attempts at reasoning out what it entails, beyond an understanding of our insufficient capacity to hold knowledge of such things that obtains, is ultimately unjustified and irrational. It's therefore delusional to hold any certain belief in so much as the existence of any such thing, let alone any particular speculative attempts that theistic beliefs follow as a matter of course.

Furthermore, I find that this line of reasoning entails local atheism about any particular system of belief which holds that certain belief in any such being's existence is even possiblly sound.

Are you saying something like: others are providing my opinion for me, which isn't based on facts, and I'm struggling to justify it, which is difficult or impossible to do?

If that's the case, I disagree. I based my opinion on viewing the video. I had previously seen Gervais' comedy special ""Humanity"", which the joke was from, so I'm already aware of the context it was originally presented in. As well as having previously seen Musk referring to Twitter as a ""de facto public town square"". I had also seen Corden before, enough to form the opinion that he was frequently annoying. After sharing my own initial thoughts on the video, with my own understanding of the context, another redditor responded here with what I now believe is a better interpretation of Corden's version. I acknowledged that already.

So, what are you trying to say? Just because someone forms an opinion based on what others have said, about what others have said, doesn't mean it isn't their own opinion nor does it entail that opinion isn't grounded in objective fact. 

What are your thoughts on the matter? Other than to criticize those who apparently disagree with you, and please support your claims or provide an alternate interpretation.

Corden and his sidekick are responding to a proposed new charge ($20/mo) to be verified on Twitter and that's when Corden shifts focus. ""So here's the thing, Elon says it's like a town square ..."" and continues with his version of the joke. The problem is the point of the joke (people take things too personally on Twitter) has no bearing on some new fee there. Although, it can be argued that by following up ""There's a new fee"" with ""Don't take things so personally"", he's actually trying to get people on board with it. But that's inconsistent with how they rebuked the fee upfront.

Division can be expressed in terms of multiplication by using the multiplicative inverse of one of the operands, its reciprocal. 42=4(1/2). Similarly with addition and subtraction, the same equation can be expressed by swapping operators and using the additive inverse of the right-hand-side (RHS) operand. 4-2=4+(-2).

Here's a good section for finding the references you're looking for:

""For instance, correlational evidence supports a link between maternal reminiscing in early childhood and young adolescents' autobiographical reasoning about turning points (Reese, Jack, & White, 2010). Turning-point narratives are based on self-defining memories and thus constitutive of narrative identity (McLean et al., 2020, McLean et al., 2007, Reese et al., 2017). However, only one experimental study to date has demonstrated this effect. Specifically, theGrowing Memoriesstudy showed that an elaborative maternal reminiscing intervention during early childhood improved the contextual and thematic coherence of young adolescents' low-point narratives (Reese et al., 2020), and the causal coherence of turning-point narratives and well-being by mid-adolescence (Mitchell & Reese, 2022).""

Unfortunately, this doesn't work for everyone. Some people are treatment resistant, meaning that our normal antipsychotics don't work for them. There's also negative symptoms of schizophrenia that the antipsychotics don't work on. That could be why that guy said trash.

It is very easy to estimate how fast it would take Bob to go to the shop and come back, since you know how far it is, and how fast Bob walks. But, what if Bob met a lion or a buffalo blocking his path? He'd take longer to go and come back, but you wouldn't have a lot of ways of knowing what happened.

Downloads work in the same way. Some downloaders estimate the time it'll take to get a file but then slow internet happens (Lion) or there's a lot of people downloading that file at that time (Buffalo) and it slows down the process. Even if the process bar is moving along, if it hasn't adjusted to such changes, then it'll move up until 99%, then stay there as it finishes up the download.


Now take the same example of Bob from above. Obviously Bob cannot carry an entire bed with him by himself for that distance easily. But, he can take one leg, bring it back, go back for another, go back for the mattress and so on and so forth until you have all the pieces you need to make a bed. However, you'd still need to put the pieces together to have the complete bed.

Same thing with downloads.

username#00417,comment,2020-12-23 02:10:14,,"Imagine you have a warehouse and a robot that can optimally carry around 50 kgs/110 pounds. Therefore you design all your packages and boxes to be either at or slightly below and above that weight.

Then along comes someone who decided that the warehouse can cut expenses by adding more items to these packages and boxes. All of a sudden, your robot that was working just fine is now creaking, moving slower than usual, parts are wearing out faster than normal.....etc.

You can probably point it back to the extra weight that was added to those boxes.



That is simply how ENBs work. Games are made in such a way that they use DirectX (Or vulkan or OpenGL or Metal) to draw out the graphics for them. Therefore, a dev decides that they'll add certain features that DirectX provides to them.

Along comes an ENB that adds in extra and advanced graphics that the game has no idea about. It will still draw them in, but it'll be more taxing to your PC since the game wasn't made with those features in mind.

Sometimes, ENBs don't add anything as much as they modify what was originally set up but it is still a bit more taxing to your PC. Hence the framerate drop.

Edit: At times, ENB makers will find a setting that they like and crank it up to 11 without consideration that other PCs will take a larger hit than their system would.",explainlikeimfive

However, there were a few issues at the time that Proton didn't solve. One of them was EAC which would not run on Linux at all AFAIK. So if you were playing single-player games mostly, you were fine. But if you're playing online games that use EAC, you had to use Windows. Some games have also been known to ban players running games in Windows emulators or even VFIO.

Writing my own contemporary music (  ). I had graduated music academy in classical & electroacoustic music composition both. rather quickly getting recognised as a talented one, I actually have been invited to numerous international festivals and being commissioned writing some new pieces (with my first important concert taking place during Warsaw Autumn 2014 - while I was still even before B.A. diploma). I really can't call myself as standing even close to fame, though. 

On the other hand I have to admit that becoming an icon never was my main goal, nor it was the motor for the actions taken. I simply wanted to make the best & most interesting music I possibly could... so I still remain being active as a composer & sound artist up to this very day.

Should anyone be interested, you may find some examples of my work here:

Secondly: imho quality of the music depends on several aspects, yet it is always a matter high above and totally beyond the division into ""genres"". a different level, totally. music is good when it is good; when it has the potential to cause a change, to resonate properly with the audience / listener(s). When it is adequately composed (structured), adequately performed / produced and thus can be well perceived by someone who cares about it - i.e. received deeply, causing an emotional and motivational ""resonance"" within a conscious listener. 

The question about finding the best form is always beyond the genre as in almost all of them one can find exquisite virtuosity sometimes, regardless of the fact one enjoys it's sthetic, style, ""language"" of expression... or not - it is a completely different issue.",AskReddit

Like your social life, **MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING**, family, friends, girl/boyfriend, your Job or your school.

But yeah I think I'm on the right track right now to get my shit together.



I'm gonna ramble cos I'm on a high dose of Ritalin and I'm manic due to that.. anyways..


BUT MAN.. like I've been in a shithole literally this time, last year, I battled addiction, I had a lot of mental health issues that I refused to seek help for, I had a lot of bottled up stuff from trauma that caused me a lot of distress.



But I'm SO thankful and lucky to have a family and friends who cared about me.. and have been with me through the entire way of my recovery, and they're still with me because I'm still not there yet I'm still in the process of healing.




So I don't know if you need to hear this right now, or someone else who will literally come across this post by accident..

But I'm VERY VERY interested to hear about your experiences, especially that you were alone, like did you ever have a bad trip? And did you use a benzo or an antipsychotic to stop the bad trip?


Or do you just ride it out man?



If you've got some time on your hands maybe shoot me a DM and tell me about it I'm always interested to hear from people who've done psychedelics, and I don't think I've ever met anyone who's done psychedelics by themselves.

But over the last few years I just feel like a dead man walking I literally feel like a bag of meat no soul no nothing



And doing stims and smoking weed mainly help me feel alive again and they make me feel productive and creative



And i become more confident on stims and I'm not afraid to confront people and confront myself and go deep into memories I buried and never thought I'd ever access but when I'm zooted I feel comfortable thinking about my traumas

And last week I was fucking smacked and they walked on me and saw me in my worst state with pills and joints all around me and like they weren't mad like my parents are educated people but they were disappointed and sad to see me in that state



And I basically got in a fight him becuase he said I'm throwing my life and my college and my scholarship away



But like I got pissed because my dad was always busy with his job and I don't blame him but he doesn't have a right to call me weak when he doesn't even know one thing about the shit that I've been through and how much I suffer from this crap on a daily basis

But like when I smoke a fuckton of weed and my psychosis creeps up all of those things come to the surface

username#00426,post,2023-04-29 11:49:21,I (18F) feel insecure around my bf (18M) because of attractiveness difference.,"So I've just entered a relationship (only two months in) with a guy who is **extremely** attractive. I actually met him because a year ago I saw him on campus and thought he was so good looking I figured I'd ask for his instagram. Well, a year later we began a relationship and have been extremely happy ever since.

He is good at communicating, very attentive, great at sex, funny, he shows that he loves me and honestly, we make a pretty good team. My only issue is that I can't help but feel insecure whenever we're out in public or having sex. I've never been too good looking (mostly because of my weight and body), I was obese as a child and though I lost the weight, I developed an eating disorder because of it. I was diagnosed with anorexia and was at death's door a couple of times because of it. Though I recovered and have been doing better ever since, I can't help but notice I constantly avoid food or over-exercise ever since starting my relationship.

I've talked to him about it and he says I'm the most beautiful girl he's ever seen, he makes me feel loved but when we're apart I just keep thinking I'm not enough and I'm afraid I'm about to relapse. I don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",relationship_advice

Kicked in after an hour and we were absolutely blazed, as in, stoned to the bone. I barely remember anything but we were tripping, salivating, we ordered some chicken and for some reason left it under the bed. We almost emptied my entire pantry, and I felt like I was melting into my bed.

We fell asleep, and I woke up ""fine"" but after 10 minutes it started to hit me again. Woke him up, tried to have sex, failed miserably but still somehow orgasmed? Fell asleep again, had the weirdest dream of my life, and he woke me up because he had to go as he had to study. He drove back to his house safely, but I was still stoned out of my mind.

It's been 3 days and I'm still high, not incredibly high, not tripping, but whenever I drink water or touch my face I feel ghost limbs? As in, I don't feel it the moment I touch my own skin, but I feel it like 4 seconds later despite me not touching anything. What the fuck and how do I stop this. Bf is in the same situation.",trees

My newfie pup is (almost) potty trained, except we have to take him for 4 walks a day and he uncontrollably pees at around 5 a.m. We take him for a 6 a.m walk (40 mins), a 1 p.m walk (40 mins), a 5 p.m walk (20 mins) and an 8 p.m walk (again, 40 mins) but we always, ALWAYS wake up to find pee on our floor. We've tried crates, but he either jumped them or chewed them, so we decided to tie him to an area without wooden floor (he prefers to pee on wood, which ended up lifting the floor of several areas of our house. We had to pay an expensive price to get it fixed, so we don't wanna do that again) also, he has plenty of space to move around even when he's tied up.

We've been starting to reduce his food rations to two times a day (not that we're cutting food, more like we're splitting it in two meals instead of three like we used to do) and... he still pees. I'm not sure on how I should handle this, we've tried a lot of things, but he just won't learn. 

Aside from typical teen dog misbehavior, this is my biggest complaint, specially because after 6 months of being with us he should've already learned... right? There must be something I'm missing, if anyone can help me find it, I would be really grateful.",dogs

Dogs are extremely intelligent, of course some will eat other animals, they are animals after all, they're not vegan angels who will put ethics and morals into perspective, but they will stick by your side if you spend enough time with them and take the time to properly train them.

Also, there are very few things humans deserve. Humans are extremely selfish, we are destroying nature and there are some real monsters out there. We have the choice to be mean, and some of us choose to be. Dogs, on the other hand, don't. You can hit a dog, cut their limbs off and with enough patience and love most will be rehabilitated and love unconditionally again. I think that is what the statement refers to. Dogs are just happy, they don't do things for evil unlike humans (and this applies to other animals as well).",unpopularopinion

username#00428,post,2022-01-27 08:37:36,(Story) I had an officer in uniform in my home last night tell me the famous words every seasoned smoker and veteran of the war on drugs wants to hear:,"Now, I know officers get a lot of bad rep, particularly around the places with lots of incarceration, and my state is no different. We still lock up people for pot too. Which is why I'm so shocked at this outcome.

I had to call the police for a domestic issue within my own home twice in the past 48 hours. I'm a seasoned smoker, been doing dabs fairly medicinally for years now. I'm chronically anxious, I get very dark twisted thoughts and delusions, I get angry over small shit, Pot has **ALWAYS** helped me find my ground again. It keeps me from lifting off into the stratosphere. I know it can get a bad rep too, but weed genuinely is medicinal for me. I don't even use combustion, I vaporize. I try to just be both mentally healthy while also reducing the bodily harm.

Anyway, onto the point I was getting at. I have 2 very polite officers in my home for the second time and this time I had no time to clean up any of my mess downstairs, nor did I think of it. Lo and behold we're forced to go downstairs anyway, me, the 2 officers and the person I had to call for. 

So there we're standing in my basement with my bong, lime green and black light sensitive with the black light going, dragons, silicon bc my hands suck with glass **IN FULL CLEAR VIEW** 

the cop leans into my shoulder and says ""so is that like an electric bong that just uses electricity no fire or anything?""

I froze in absolute abject horror. I said the first thing that came to mind, a quiet, but affirming ^(yes, uh yea, it just uses electricity.)

I'm dead, I'm losing minutes off my life by standing here and doing nothing. I can feel life fading away from my body, I could pass out if I wasn't chock full of **adrenaline.** 

we move back upstairs and they are on their way out the door. I'm able to wave down the guy who asked the simple, but genuine question about the e-nail. I simply say: *I'm sorry to put you in that position, I would have put it away, I use it medicinally""*

You know what this **giga-chad** says to me? 

**Dude, it's just weed. I don't care.**

Was that the moment my entire conscious life had led up to? one officer telling me it's okay I enjoy smoking pot? Are we reaching a critical mass?

I'm preheating my rig now, God damn this shit just blew me away though. 20 years of fighting with police, hiding, all the hiding, the war on drugs, the jail time I personally have spent over it, I got kicked out of school for pot, no rehab, nothing, just gone, get lost kid. Now? We're here?",trees

I just watched [this dumb ass DIY Air Filtration video]( like 2 years ago and thought to myself. That filter doesn't filter out smoke, but it could! since then I have been running this set-up in my smoking room with zero issues.

[Lasko 3 speed box fan from walmart]( + [Allergen Plus Odor Reduction HVAC Furnace Air Filter, 1200 MPR]( or any of the odor reduction ones with carbon = a completely smell free home with many added health benefits (don't ask me to name them, use your imagination, it's cleaner air in your home)

The carbon is the important part, it works by neutralizing and capturing the smoke in the air, activated carbon does this most effectively. The push pull filtration system works with a single fan as well, just half the throughput.

The filter usage highly depends on smokage in your home. more smoke = more filters *but don't expect to use more then one a month.*

[The filter system. It goes in one side, and out the other. Both Fans airflow same direction.](",trees

Source: The US spends over double the next country (china) in advertising.,"""The  United States is, by far, the largest advertising market in the  world. In 2016, more than 190 billion U.S. dollars were spent in advertising in the United States. This figure is more than double the  amount spent in advertising in China, the second largest ad market in  the world. Forecasts show healthy projections for the ad market in the  U.S. for 2017, as media advertising spending is expected to reach the 207 billion U.S. dollars mark this year. Television has been the  biggest  advertising medium in the United States in the last few years, but is  projected to lose the market lead in 2017 to digital. TV advertising revenue was forecast to grow from 73 billion U.S. dollars  in 2016 to  around 75 billion U.S. dollars in 2017 and 82 billion in  2020.""

[Source](

My question is, why did this happen? Who is buying these products? I just find it strange for a country with the population density of the USA, the advertising market is so vast.

Furthermore, if all this money is spent on advertising, then my local dns ad blocking e.g [AdGuard Home]( is... checkmate?

2 parts lemon juice from concentrate

1 part rubbing alcohol or vinegar, 70%  or White is fine.

1 part (ish) hot water

1/2 part salt, regular is fine, save iodized for people eating it.

Mix in a bottle or some other leak proof container till the solution is murky, and a cohesive solution.

For small pieces - acquire a zip-lock bag, place piece in bag and add  solution, you don't need a ton, and can always repeat the process. Shake  till clean, rinse with hot water.

for large or medium pieces  firmly, and carefully grasp the entire piece, empty it out of any  remaining substance. Fill it 1/2 fill of the solution and vigorously  shake entire piece till clean, rinse with hot water.

1/5th the cost of store brand cleaner, super easy to make, works twice as well.

I don't expect any gratitude from this, Just a happy discovery I made during a local shortage.Today? I clean any piece I use daily before I use it for pennies. I used to let it go because I hated to spend money on the expensive store bought brand, so I hope this helps y'all as much as it helps me.

""Here is an example of a conversation so you can see how a covert abuser might uses all these tactics together to confuse you:

You are discussing your relationship and he looks sincere and attentive while you talk (positive reinforcement). For every issue you bring up, he says he doesn't know what you are talking about (denial), or he retells his version of the story (gaslighting) and slips in a flaw about you (diverting). 

You try to re-explain yourself so he can understand better. He calmly and rationally explains why the problem is your perception (changing the narrative) and your difficulty in trusting others (distorting reality). He has a perfectly good response and reason for why he does what he does (rationalizing).  Then he sincerely explains that he feels he is being controlled by you and has a hard time trusting you (playing the victim), that you don't care enough about his feelings (guilt-tripping) and that he wants to take responsibility for his part (lies). 

Then he takes the conversation off into another direction (diverting) and nothing gets resolved. 
You feel blamed but you think you must be too sensitive and reading into things. 
You are confused for feeling intimidated and defensive against what appears to be nothing. 
You wonder if you are the toxic person in the relationship.

And I just so happen to have been showing those, rather these same signs since adolescence.

Pro-tip? Don't put your kids on meth or prescription meth (adderal, Ritalin, vivans, cogentin...ect)  9 times out of 10 it will make it worse then anything else. It's a direct ticket to prison. Sorry to say, but putting your kids on heavy meds (good god, look up the chemical compounds of those) that young will have intense and life long consequences. Chose your poison wisely.

Send me flying through the sky 3 times a year I'm fairly sure I wouldn't give a shit about some trophy.


This coming from someone who has sky dove (it's on my youtube) and loved every single pico second of it.

Consider money doesn't buy happiness, no, seriously, it doesn't.

Money does however buy you enough tandem skydive to eventually do it solo, which, to me, would be sheer bliss.

Consider your opinion ain't shit,  and neither is mine, which doubly makes you look like an idiot for this post.

Also stating the obvious here but I think if anybody could use the life-changing perspective altering experience of a skydive it would be people like you that value money over happiness

Edit: and before some Neanderthal comes in here and tells me "" that's just cuz you have money."" Or  ""Well that's just cuz you come from money.""

I've lived below the poverty line the literal federal poverty line for 15 years. I still value the skydive over cash or a gift card. r/FlyAKite",facepalm

Hi everyone

Ive been on most the above medications for well over 3 years now
 Except the cypro, which has been less than a year.

I occasionally get a bump from where i used to get the injection of invega which was administered above the butt which i believe was wrong for them to do the bump is raised and no mark and just feels like a  painful hard lump with no marks. It usually goes away after a week.

The last few weeks my right arm feels out of place im not sure what i could of done to cause this.

Then finally my nipples are really sore inside, everytime my son jumps on me and he accidentally presses on them it hurts really bad its hard to ignore, my nipples are very puffy so i dunno if that has anything to do with it.

Im strongly considering stopping me medicine because i feel like these are all side effects but i know that would be a terrible idea with my schizophrenia.

username#00431,post,2019-07-14 05:19:20,"AITA for telling my friend ""You know what, go the fuck home""?","My friend, we'll call him ""A"", is someone I love to death. We've known each other since 2nd grade and only really started hanging out together in high school. A few years ago, I was hospitalized for Schizophrenia and he was one of the people that I personally knew (so not friends of my parents, family, spouses of family) that visited me. I always make a point of it that I can never thank him enough for being there for me, and being with my family, in the best way he could.  He's a type of person that feels really guilty about a lot of stuff in his life, to a level of irrationality, and he drinks every day to numb the pain. He smokes weed now and then, and does cocaine (with me !) every once in a blue. Believe it or not this whole ""get so high you forget the pain"" thing kinda made use grow closer.

Fast forward to more recent times.

This guy drinks and drives. All the time. One time he got so drunk he went to the base of a bridge and ran out of gas, not knowing how he got there (I went and helped him). He already has a DWI and he's lost the trust of his parents (they dont know about the DWI;  probably kick him out for that) because of being drunk. His parents, and him funnily enough, aren't super strict Muslims, but they follow the holy book, pray, etc.  Whenever we hang out, either I pick him up or he comes to my house and I drive from there. Every time I ask him to drive, his excuse is ALWAYS ""Yo, I'm drunk, I can't drive"". I counter with ""you be driving drunk to (insert neighborhood) to do (something I'm not gonna say on the internet) and all of a sudden you can't drive."" Then he replies, you really gonna make me drive, I'm drunk bro, what if we get pulled over.... you know what, if you don't drive, I'm going home."" And that's interesting to me because I'm thinking why not stay by me for a bit, sober up, and THEN drive home? You're gonna immediately go home, fully drunk, after going so hard over not drinking and driving ?

Fast forward to today.

He pulls up to my house, gets out and says I'm not driving with a big ass smile on his face. I'm like ok, why ? He says he's drunk. I bring up the thing about him drinking and driving all the time. He gets angry and says you know what, if you're not driving, I'm going home. At that point I've had enough of that line, essentially holding me by the fucking balls every time he says it, and told him you wanna go home, go the fuck home.

10 minutes later I get a text from him saying I'm the only person that forces him to drive drunk and that DWI's are serious.

In May I could not breathe. I had developed tracheal stenosis from the intubation. I had an emergency tracheotomy. 

And now, on December 1st I am having a cricotracheal resection surgery that will fix my natural airway, remove the tracheostomy and give me a chance at a life again. 

I attempted suicide because I had to stop one of my medications immediately as it was drastically lowering my white blood cells. It made me extremely depressed, as far as I can remember, which isn't much from that night, and was probably hearing stuff. 

My family acts like removing the trach will fix me and everything will be good. But it has never been good. I will no longer have a trach, but I will still be mentally ill. 

And I want to take this chance and do something with jt and fix myself but holly hell I am lost and so fucking tired of doing thing to keep busy all day every day instead of working or doing something that MATTERS in this world. I think doing something. Something real and right will help my mental health so much but I don't know what to do.

I am 29. Female. Have my AA in graphic design. Worked at a web design company since 2012 until February of this year. It's the only job I've ever had. I could go back, but I didn't enjoy it too much. More-so stayed because I was too shy and nervous to interview elsewhere. It was stressful. 

Also have not spoken since May because of the stenosis. I cannot use a speaking valve. I cannot breathe with one. My stenosis is complete. So I have to adjust to speaking again after surgery. I do not know how easy or difficult that will be.

He is dead, though. Lucky bastard died before I was ok enough to admit what happened to anyone. He lived his life abusing kids in peace and got away with what he did.

I have one class left in community college before I get my AA degree in Graphic and Web Design. But it's insanely difficult for me to go to school, it's ridiculously stressful to finish this one class and I find myself becoming symptomatic.

Should I just give up the idea of being ""normal"" and working? Should I just focus on my mental health and spend my days going to groups at my mental health clinic and focusing on meds and stuff? Should my life become mental health focused?

I was also sexually abused as a kid. That's the big thing. The biggest thing in my world. When I realized what I had done to me.. it turns my stomach. I was apart of *that*. I still feel disgusting, feel my abuser touching me. Everything is broken.

I remember how little I was, 4 or 5 when it started, about 9 when it stopped, and on and off until I was 12, when he died(but not before he told me I was too old to play with him). 

My heart hurts for the little kid me that was so unconscionably lonely and craving love. I wish to save her, but that falls into my ""delusions"" about my abuser still being alive and everyone covering up for him.

I'm 25, a female virgin. I'm scared of sex. I'm scared it's going to feel like rape. I'm scared all the time people around me are pedophiles and can see through the adult me and want to hurt me. 

I get sexual urges. It makes me sick but I get them. I just don't know how to deal with them. My body does not feel like my own. It was taken away when I was a kid. Now since I developed Schizophrenia, I get therapy and medication but I can't take more than one class at college because if I take any more I'll get symptomatic, hear voices, and end up hospitalized for hurting myself due to the overwhelming strength of my symptoms.

He commented on body hair and shamed me so I got embarrassed and ran away from his apartment back to my apartment, we were neighbors, he was around my grandfather's age and they were friends.

He died soon after, but I didn't learn that until I was a teen and told my mom about what had happened. 

Anyways, I was at a part a few years ago and got terrifyingly drunk. I had abuse flashbacks where I couldn't get away, I screamed all night things like, ""Please stop, please make him stop"" ""you have to save me, please stop"" ""I'm only 6 years old""

I've never experienced anything more terrifying. I cried for hours and I could feel him, his body head behind me as I, a kid, sat on his lap. I could feel trapped and see myself suffering and I cried for all the other kids he abused in that apartment.

My mom is controlling, narcissistic, judgemental. It's very difficult to live with her. 

At the end of the year my dad and stepmom are moving to a different city and have invited me to live with them. They are wonderful, caring, loving people. Have some flaws, but they make me happy. Problem with this is that I'll be an hour and half bus ride from my work, where I do project management. It's not a total deal breaker, just a bit of a longer commute than I'd like.

My sister is moving back in June, she's pregnant with her 2nd child. She's asked me in the past to move in with her to help with finances, but this time she hasn't said anything, so I guess that isn't really an option. She's angry all the time and can be unhealthy so I'm going to leave that option as-is. 

I feel a sense of obligation to help my sister out financially, and guilt for not doing so.

I'm scared my mom will be hurt if I move out.

After writing this all, I think I just have to wait it out and live with my mom until my dad and stepmom get the new living situation in control...

Any feedback or anything?

So I was wondering if I should contact my old school to see if they need an assistant for design. 

The teacher I had that introduced me to graphic arts still works there, it'd be fantastic if I could be his assistant and introduce the same programs to kids as he did with me. I'd really love to give someone the coping skill I got from the design programs.

Thing is, I don't even have my associates degree yet, just an ""Advanced Skill Certificate"" from my community college showing I've taken all the design classes possible at that college for Graphics & Web. 

Do you guys think I should try to contact the school to see if they have any assistant job available? Their site doesn't have a career page so I can't tell from that.

Also note, this is my only job ever, I landed it at 21 and now I'm 24. I feel like I owe my boss so much.

After some time off, I started working again for the company in October or November of last year, after a hospitalization in September for a suicide attempt.

I got hired from an unpaid internship at the company in March of 2012, my rate being $9/hr, I got a .50 cent raise at some point, then in 2014 after I had been out of work for a while trying to focus on my health my boss welcomed me back with a $12/hr rate because the company was doing well. 

So here I am. The last time I missed work was this March when I was hospitalized for hurting myself.

My boss can be micromanaging and difficult to understand(English isn't his first language). He gets obsessive about unimportant things and makes everything seem urgent.

But he's also pretty great, because as many times as I've been hospitalized since 2012, probably at least twice a year, he ha always welcomed me back with open arms, knowing and understanding my Schizophrenia situation.

But I'm 23, with Schizophrenia, living in a sober living as a safe place, it is ""dual-diagnosis"" so I can stay here, though I'm not an addict or alcoholic at all.

I've been at the sober living a whole year already, I have no privacy. 14 girls in one house, 4 to a bedroom. It's blahh, it sucks.

Trouble is, my rent was being paid by my psychiatrists office, so that I could use my SSI money to settle some debts, and I have done that. So now that I have less debt they want me to start paying $410 for rent and they'll cover the rest(of $700 rent). 

It's fine, they've done so much for me, but I get around $860 a month. I want to save up large chunks so I can live in my own apartment by myself when I'm more stable.. 

The only way to save a lot in a little time is if I move in with my mom, because I'd be paying her only $200 since she lives in a low-incoming apartment.

Yes, my mom has been abusive and controlling, but if I step out of my shoes for a moment I can see the intentions clearer, she cares about me. She nags me about my hair and hygiene and appearance because she wants the best for me.

So maybe I gotta step up, realize that she is just a certain way and learn to live with it?

My boss welcomes me back all the time, if I text him that I want to come back he'll be happy and ask when I'd like to start.

But is this the way to fight off my symptoms? Or will it make me more stressed out and end up in a hospital? 

I've been feeling unmotivated and hearing voices a lot, but I'm not getting delusional this time. 

I just want to be healthy. You know how they say dress for the job you want? 

Should I work for the mental stability I want? 

I want to go back there asap, but it isn't fair to my boss if I have to leave again, so I'm scared. Stability for me has always been temporary. 

Is it fair for me to work for him if eventually the instability will rise and make me have to take time off?",Advice
username#00432,post,2015-06-12 22:06:35,Should I go back to my old job?,"I'm 23, female with Schizophrenia. 

I worked for the past 4 years as a Graphic Designer for a Web Design/Marketing company. This was my first and so far only job that I've ever done. I got lucky, my passion was made clear during my unpaid internship at the company and they knew they wanted me. 

I have left the company a few times for health reasons, being Schizophrenic. I've been hospitalized a few times during work and my boss has been nothing but understanding. He's always told me to take the time I need and I'm welcome to come back any time. 

In March I left the company after a two week hospitalization for a suicide attempt. 

I don't *need* the money. I'm ok without it, I've adjust ed to be without it and the money I get from the government for my mental health disability is ok, I can live off that.

But damn, my life has no *purpose*! I'm doing a bit of freelance but it's going slow. I'd like to be able to save money for a future but I can't on government funds. 

The job can be stressful, but I've always loved it. It's always given me the sense of power I crave. I was in charge of interns and project management and talking to programers from India at 8 AM to work on website mistakes. 

There was always a rush that came from the meetings and servers going down and social media events for our clients.

It made me feel *amazing*. And now I'm nothing. I'm an attempting freelancer. Barely getting any extra money. I wasn't making major funds at the job($12/hr) but it was good enough because I got to work with great people. 

I'm just scared to go back and fail again, I'm scared to go back and then end up in a mental hospital AGAIN and have to leave AGAIN. 

I want to be more reliable than I am. But the illness holds me back, limits me. 

Should I go back to my old job? My boss will definitely welcome me, as he told me this last time that I left. I'll always have a place there. 

Or should I spend my time going to group therapy at my doctor's office and focus on recovery? 

I'm doing pretty good now, the medication I'm on has me feeling healthier. But that can change at any time and so I'm scared about working... 

I just miss feeling like my life had meaning. ",Advice

I feel like I'm on a salad kick lately. I've been eating a salad almost everyday. But is that a good way to go for weight loss?

Here's my plan, because I can get very lazy with cooking--

I can just pre-make salads for the week and eat 'em as time goes on. I feel like that'd be pretty easy, no cooking required or anything.

Is this a good plan? Eat salads 2-3 times per day? If I get bored I'll still have some low-cal snacks like fruit parfaits or something. 

I'll be using my fitness pal to cal calculate how many calories each salad has.

I'm 23. Schizophrenic. Been diagnosed for 2 years, symptomatic for a spell longer. 

My ""delusions"" take me back to my childhood. They revolve around the events of my childhood. Around the abuse. Around the loneliness. 

Neglected. Sexually abused for years by an elderly neighbor that I called my grandpa, even though he wasn't. He was my grandfather's friend. 

I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know. I thought it was normal. I was maybe 5 or 6 when it all began. I didn't know. 

Fuck. I'm in tears and I just want to tell the fucking truth. I need to write out for one goddamn time what everything *is*. 

I'm sick of believing in the lies my brain tells me. 

I'm *not* guilty. But I'm not a fucking victim. I got through those times. 

One day I realized it was abuse. I was in major denial for a long time. Thought the monster was my best fucking friend as a kid. He ""loved"" me. He gave me attention when I was starving for it. That's it. 

And now I'm 23 and I'm Schizophrenic and my delusions go around my voices telling me to save them from a demon that's hurting them.

My abuser gave me prayer beads to play with on the floor of his apartment every time after he'd finish with me. 

It's all connected. Not too clearly, but it is. 

He's the demon, as every therapist ever has decided. He's always been the demon. 

He died before I could get justice. So my horrified mind came up with a way that I could get ""justice"" in some way. 

Kill myself, go to the other dimension, kill the demon. Save *somebody*.

Oh man, I'm tired. Why is he my whole life? How do I erase him? He's in my head and in my heart and he hasn't the right. 

Every fucking day I feel his body behind mine and I want to slit my wrists and melt away. I can feel him behind me. It's not ok. ",offmychest
username#00432,post,2015-05-01 23:22:42,"I need to re-learn logical thought, because everyone says I'm wrong","I'm not really religious... but I'm scared. Not that I'm wrong. Just that I'm sick. I know what I know, but I know everyone thinks it's false. 

See, I'm Schizophrenic. Diagnosed the past 2 years, though dealt with it a spell longer. I know what other people would say is that I'm symptomatic. And I can understand that, but I feel so strongly that it's much more than that. 

Demons and Gods and people suffering that I have to save. 

I need to be logical, badly. I'm straying from what everyone says is logic and my illness is inventing things and I don't know what is true anymore. They're supposed to be false. 

But I believe in 'em. Because the voices tell me I'm their God. That I can save them. That I'm meant to kill myself, and die only in that way, to travel to their dimension, and save them. 

Now, I've tried and failed at it. Tried and gotten scared. Chickened out. So I'm left here, alive, medicated, sometimes being ""symptomatic"" and sometimes being pretty ok. 

I just need someone to tell me what's real and what's right. I need to learn how to be logical over again because sometimes I get so deep into these thoughts that they consume me and I can't talk about anything else, and I can't talk straight, it doesn't make sense.

I don't believe I need a God. It doesn't make sense to me that there is one, but it makes sense that I AM one. Because the voices have told me that for so long. That the universe revolves around me and my story. 

I know how it sounds. And I'm getting bad again, so I'm trying really really hard to have an open mind and try to believe people. But I keep getting recurring thoughts that everyone is tricking me, but that the voices are true. 

Someone told me the other day that they might be the ones lying to me. And I'm considering that. But it's freaking me out.

I don't really know what I'm asking.... I guess that someone should help me put my mind straight for a moment. Because I know what I'm supposed to believe and what is supposed to be real, but I KNOW that I'm a God stuck here in this dimension, needing to kill herself and go to the next dimension and save a world of people.

username#00432,post,2015-03-22 02:37:32,Don't know where I'm headed in life,"I'm so tired of not knowing what to do in life. Sometimes I just want to kill myself, and some days I'm more motivated and want to do things that will (hopefully) make me successful in life. 

I'm 23, go to school(one class at a time...) and work part-time as a graphic designer at a small web design company. 

I've been diagnosed with Schizophrenia for the past 2 years. It's been really really rough. Voices on and off.. delusions.. it's been like a nightmare. It gets better sometimes, and it'll be nice and I won't notice how good things are until they get worse again.

It's just mostly bad. I just want to live a good life and I'm starting to see my limitations.. I do get disability/SSI, and now I actually feel disabled. Because the stress of attempting to work more than part-time or to take more than one class at a time sends me into a terrible psychotic episode that lands me in the hospital. 

I hate feeling this way. Limited. I would like to be an illustrator, or do freelance graphic design and be able to support myself instead of living with roommates.. but I don't know if that will ever happen.

I'm feel stupid. Behind on life compared to others my age. 

I don't know how to be successful. I have these plans.. like, maybe I should move out of my group home and go back with my mom who is unsupportive, for cheaper rent and my own room again. Or maybe move in with stranger roommates instead of this group home that's actually a sober living but ""dual-diagnosis"" so mentally ill people can live here. 

I just don't know what's best for me. And I'm really really afraid of doing the wrong thing. 

Just last week I wasn't sure if any of the world around me was real, because I was experiencing severe depersonalization and ""delusions"" as they're considered. I'm still not sure. Not sure if I should end my 'verse with suicide or not.

It's so difficult. So, reddit, what's best for my future? Am I doomed to live in group home type situations my whole life because of my disability? ",Advice

Not these fake roommates friends I have that don't truly care about me. It's an obligation. I can't stand it. The rules.

I'm 23, female, a graphic and web designer for a web design & marketing company, and I'm 2 classes away from my Associates degree. I also struggle with Schizophrenia. And because of that, live with 12 women in a ""dual-diagnosis"" sober living for my recovery. I'm not an alcoholic or an addict, but haven't used any of that for over a year because I've been living here and it isn't allowed. Regardless of that, it is bad for my mental state in my experience. 

I struggle a lot with my illness. But right now I'm not happy in any aspect of my life. Work is.. repetitive, frustrating, my boss is understanding but can also be very rude and thoughtless. He's only a person, after-all. I get it.

But I live too far from school, too far from my doctors office.

An opportunity has arose in which I may be able to live with a former co-worker who will be moving out in approximately 2 months form her family's home to her own apartment with her sister. She could use a roommate. She said she will speak with her sister and get back to me.

If I do this, I will want to find a new job in the new area, which is closer to other important things in my life: doctors, therapy, school.

It will work out. But I'm scared. 

If I get a new job and can't cope, end up in the hospital and losing my new job, how will I leave my friend/possible roommate in regards to finances? 

There's a lot to consider and I'm very afraid. But I have to get out of this place. These people I live with, they don't work, go to school, or do much except recover. They go to meetings and clean all day, and watch a lot of TV, and it somehow drains me. 

It's depressing. It's isolating, I'm stuck in this world of addiction where I don't quite belong. 

I just want to feel comfortable. Should I try to move out with my friend/ former co-worker?

From an elderly man that was friends with the family. Didn't stop until about 9, then started again for the last time around 12, but that was just one time because I was too old and he commented on my growing and I left, embarrassed. 

It haunts me... It hurts me. I feel the abuse over and over like my body is reliving it. 

And I'm a 22 year old female schizophrenic. My delusions, as some would call them, wrap around my abuse. 

When I was being abused he always gave me his prayer beads, as a reward after he was done with me. And I was grateful to have them, I treasured them. 

But I've always been a God, just like the voices tell me. 

They tell me to kill myself. That I'm their almighty God and savior. They NEED me to off myself. 

They pray to me, beg me for salvation. Scream and cry as they're being abused by the same monster that abused me. HE DIED IN THIS DIMENSION only to go to the next, the one where I'm a God and he's the devil. 

Delusions. I know better. No one understands. I'm alone.

There's so much screaming. 

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKING FUCK I WANT TO BE NORMAL. I WANT THIS GONE.

I want to be safe..

Can't control myself, not safe, I'm a danger. I listen to the voices, traumatize people with my self-destructive actions. I'm a danger, like him. 

Meds are working, only unintelligible whispers are left. Whisper whisper whisperyyy stuff.

I listen harder for words. For language. Need to protect them. 

I just want to explode. There's too much pain. There's no safe place. This isn't my world. 

Great stuff is happening, positive over the overwhelming negative. 

I'm breaking, what if I don't deserve to be  happy?

What if I get this internship I applied for, how will I function? Some days I just can't communicate, I need mental health days. To function.

I'm just trying, incredibly hard, to function. To be a person.",offmychest

- I replace one of my meals throughout the day with a shake consisting of this powder:  and flax milk/ almond milk. 

- 2nd meal can be 2 eggs

- 3rd meal can be veggies and some sort of low cal meat like crab or chicken or clams, maybe tilapia? Or just a salad.

the shake would be 90 calories plus 30 for the almond milk or flax milk I use so 120. 

2 eggs are 140

salad or meat probably around 300 calories. 

Would that work to help me lose weight? Should I be eating more than that? I could use some advice, please.

username#00438,post,2021-01-29 06:41:39,School of Shadows: A Shadow People Religion,"The Life's Addition Theory, the brain must eventually come to a conclusion that life is a series of adding things up. From one focus to another focus, life is a series of added focuses. Look at your life as one straight line of addition of observations accumulating and forming into what we have as our conscious thoughts. Life is addition. The together added sums of visual focuses turned into mental focuses carried with you in your forefront thought matrix form your conclusions and perception of life. You are your thoughts. Life is perception, thoughts are perception, perception is reality ergo thoughts are reality, I think therefore I am. The rules of the universe are dictated by the conscious observer. Shared witness accounts solidify the rules of the universe. Through use of imagination overlapping reality causes simulation theory to be in effect. Psychosis bends the rules of the universe for the observer that together with imagination causes reality to schism apart. We believe psychosis has contributed to dismantling reality and making it more simulation. Shadow people and voices are of this simulation as well and make for positive addition to the conscious observer. Shadow people are closest things we have to Angel's and Demon's in humanity and they seem to like to conversate with most individuals that encounter them. That brings me to my next point.

They want to be worshipped. But they want to be worshipped in a unique way. They have the gift of cloning us and using our clones as voices for people. Through use of advanced mechanics with imagination/memory/dream, binds were made and used to create a superior version of everyone. This superior version of you is called the ego. To feed it, you must recall memory in front of a mirror. Through a chain of worship, you feeding your ego, your ego playing in your dreams or playing you as a person, your ego worships the shadow people. This is the School of Shadows.

In this religion, predictions are highly valued, the more predictions you make the better, when you do have predictions come true, we shall further investigate you and see if you are gifted and blessed for this religion. Dreams are very important to us: all dreams must be recorded, shared and interpreted. As you progress with worshipping your ego by recalling memory, your ego will assist you in dream engineering. The longer you practice this religion, greater chance of being visited by your ego in a dream.

In this religion, we believe in voices and schizophrenics, all schizophrenics could potentially be a prophet. We will write a book of the stories of potential messiahs and people who suffered from psychosis and rejoice for them. We value those who have outstanding imagination, for it may be the best way to create an afterlife for ourselves potentially. Astral Projection is highly valued within this religion. Astral Entities may be linked to Shadow People. Because Life is Addition, we believe in having good imagination, dreams and memory recall to fulfill your ever-growing calculations of forefront thought.

The whole universe seemed like it was designed for me. 

The voices started after a year into slamming meth. They haven't gone away. They introduced themselves one at a time to me and showed me a visual counterpart by flashing me imagination. I think they are real life beings that live in a dimension that overlaps ours. 

They are severely advance and can manipulate my mind's eye vision very well. They also manipulate my dreams. In the name of science, I've done many experiments: I've volunteered my body to them and in doing so, they have mapped out my nervous system completely with advance astral technology.

""I woke up in hospital after an episode of sleep paralysis. Apparently he was trying to kill me while I slept. It was a nightmare of sorts.   
As I walked into my dorm room I saw David standing near my bedroom door. The only reason I didn't freak out was because my mom was sitting next to him. She hugged me and asked why he was there. I explained everything that happened to her and she looked like she wanted to smack that bastard again.  
After explaining that the school called CPS he disappeared. After they released us my family drove us to the hospital. My mom stayed with me during visiting hours and David stayed back. When they let me leave I went back to my room. That was until David knocked on my door, he looked angry and pissed.  
""You shouldn't have done that"", he said walking past me and going to sit on my desk. I just stared at him confused. Wasn't he just there? What else did I do wrong.  
""Do not try to defend yourself"" He said glaring at me. ""Why the fuck would I attack you?"" I questioned. He glared at me, it felt like it was a stare down.  
""What did I ever do to hurt you"" I continued. ""Nothing! You just don't give a damn about anything"".""",TrueOffMyChest

In truth, individual conflicts are more complex than that. Oftentimes there IS a right answer, so this analogy doesn't apply.

But seeing as this seems to be about a subjective statement, it's trickier.  Assuming you said something that hurt someone's feelings, I do believe that both how your comment is interpreted and how it's meant matter. The hurt doesn't necessarily go away because someone clarified that they didn't mean to be hurtful.

I was in a similar situation as you when I was your age. My best friend was often the target of groomers, and she acted out sexually as the result of trauma she'd endured in her childhood. I totally get that it's hard to know what to do at 12, and that is a completely fair point. You were also just a kid. And there's a chance she wouldn't have responded the way she did if you approached her with concern instead of blame. My friend always brushed off my concern, but I tried to be there for her as best I could, which for me meant telling my mom about what was happening.

You caught feelings for someone that you did not act on. You were confused because you've been with this person since you were very young, and you don't know anything else. You tried to do the right thing and end the relationship before someone got hurt. That's all totally human and understandable. What's not cool is him not respecting your wishes when you tried to end things, not taking no for an answer, and violating your privacy by going through your phone, and using your private conversation to hurt you. That is not right or okay.

Editing to say that I just realized I misrepresented your story the same way everyone else here has. You didn't even have feelings for the guy when you first tried to leave your boyfriend. I don't think it matters either way. The way your boyfriend is acting is inexcusable. Personally, I believe your therapist is right in saying your feelings for this other guy aren't genuine.

If not medicated it can make life pretty much unlivable. Like talking to things that aren't there, seeing things other people don't see, driving is dangerous af, and time tends to quit existing in some form or another.

My hallucinations usually consist of hospitals where my ""actual"" body is being monitored and doctors and nurses that come to check on me, mostly just the one (his name's Dr. Bryan Nabors) though.

Currently I'm 9 days without any medication and its rough. My mind feels like its in a more aware state than before but my body feels physically sick and its bringing me down. I dont have an apetite, feel nauseous, got terrible insomnia, anxiety, sweating lots, get dizzy whenever I stand up and my body just feels all the more tired because of all this.  


Luckily I don't have to work for atleast another month so I got a bit of time. I guess I was just curious as to how anyone else has dealt with coming off this disgusting drug. Im taking melatonin at night to help me sleep and eating healthy when I can but thats about it.  


Also how can anyone even allow olanzapine to be prescibed for long periods of time? Yes it has prevented another episode of psychosis but at what cost?  I have become a hermit and lost all my friends and passions thanks to this life sucking drug. I've heard there are many less harmful anti-psychotics and it sucks I've had to lose 2 years of my life being numbed out on this tranquilizer. Its literally a fucking benzo with an extra chain.

Because of this, I'm gonna make a very important phone call on Monday. I'm gonna ask directly what the process is for getting on HRT, how much it'll cost me and what I have to do in order.

More than likely we will lose this insurance before I actually get on T, long story there, but at least it should cover a physiological diagnosis and establish the need for transition.

Are there any questions y'all recommend asking? Maybe things I otherwise wouldn't think about? I know I need to ask about costs, where they'd sent me, and whether my dad would find out (he knows I'm trans but isn't fully on board yet). Not entirely sure what else I could need.",ftm

username#00448,comment,2023-10-21 17:10:20,,"you're wrong. I work in a pharmacy, and this is such incorrect info.

My pharmacists will ALWAYS only give a days supply of 7 days per vial dispensed (unless they're injecting more than 1.0ml/week, or differently than once/week). Because they are single use vials, which while you technically *can* get multiple uses put of them, some people cannot, in OP's case they can't because of an autoimmune disorder.

In addition, you're absolutely NOT supposed to be mixing T from different vials. That can lead to cross exposure of bacteria from both bottles. So with a script for .6ml/week, they can only get 1 dose per vial.

A pharmacist will not go to jail for correctly filling a script based on the manufacturer's warnings; ie ""do not reuse vial"".",ftm

username#00450,comment,2022-04-05 19:59:08,,"Schizophrenia is not a multiple personality disorder, that would be DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder).  Their symptoms overlap, but one is caused by abuse (DID) and the other has a genetic component.  DID also splits or fragments a personality while schizophrenia is a whole unit or ""Singlet"".  It is possible to have DID and Schizophrenia though.

Generally I wake up in the morning and I lay in bed sometimes for a couple hours before I finally get up to empty my bladder, then I sit down on my bed naked and stare down at my feet for a while before finally putting PJ pants and a shirt on, then a few more minutes and I can get my fuzzy slippers on.

Then I stand up, take my meds and drink plenty of water and sit down at my computer.  I generally scroll through YouTube's recommended videos, Netflix, Crackle and other streaming services not able to find anything to watch.  Even TikTok is kinda meh most of the time.  Only a 15 second video?  Eh, scroll past that shit after 1 second.  Someone faking DID?  NEXT! Oh another tourette's faker, scroll.

I've lately also been sitting in the living room on the couch, just casually hitting my vape and just watching my little goldfish swim around and nibble at rocks.

It's been now 3 days since I've been able to get myself to bathe and probably a month since I last flossed and brushed my teeth.  Several months since I shaved.

I have all kinds of food to eat, including cheese pizza that I can simply microwave for a few minutes to eat and even that is too troublesome so I generally just open a can of condensed soup and eat it straight out of the can.  I know it's better to cook it properly with water and all that jazz but I can't be bothered.  Either that or I open a can of fruit to eat or drink a can of creamed corn.

I go to bed late at night, the voices tend to keep me awake.  I try to masturbate but I just end up getting bored with that and give up before I get anywhere and just roll over to stare at the wall until sleep eventually comes.  I wake up the next morning it's pretty much all the same all over again.",oddlyterrifying

username#00450,comment,2022-04-05 19:46:08,,"It's rather difficult to describe in full detail without writing a long novel.  I'll give a recent example though.  Before grocery deliveries from Walmart were a thing, at the start of the pandemic, I hallucinated that an old friend of mine in Arizona (I'm in Alabama) was at the store and I ran into him.  He walked with me while I shopped and talked.  I noticed people looking at me weird but figured they were racist or something because I'm hanging with a feminine sounding black man.

I have a very strong irrational fear of statues, irrational to other people, because I regularly see them breathing.

I regularly get startled by a loud crash or bang nearby me that sounds like something crashing through a window or through a wall.

I also have issues with thought blocking and echolalia.

The negative symptoms like avolition and anhedonia are also terrible.  Lack of energy and motivation to take care of yourself so it's not hard to sometimes go a week or more without teeth brushing, showering, changing clothes, getting dressed, cleaning, cooking food, etc.  There's also no joy in anything.  Can't find entertainment or any interest in any stimuli so it's not uncommon to just end up being a couch ornament for days just staring blankly at a wall wishing there was something to do.",oddlyterrifying

username#00450,comment,2022-04-05 19:34:16,,"Believe it or not, for the better part of 10 years I believed I was psychic because of it.

I also had the regular hallucination of seeing color around people which he believed to be aura vision.

It was a psychotic delusion that persisted for years because people fed into the delusion and encouraged it.

It's extremely difficult to tell what is and is not real even with the voices.  I can't even tell if something paranormal happens or not either.  You see a shadow person out the corner of your eyes and look at it and it disappears.  For me, I see it at the corner of my eyes and look at it, then it persists and starts moving about.",oddlyterrifying

I also believed several times that my roommate was trying to poison me so I was super careful about food.

There's also the major issues of being unable to think properly, like I'll stop mid though about something and completely forget called thought blocking.  Echolalia is also a huge issue, especially with people that aren't used to it because they think I'm being a little pissant repeating everything they say.

Then there's the imposters, the fake people.  They aren't really there.  The shadow people.  Broken time.

The biggest overall issues are the negative symptoms like avolition and anhedonia.  Basically no energy nor motivation to do things to take care of yourself like brushing teeth, showering, shaving, laundry, chores, etc.  And there's no enjoyment out of anything in life, even if you love a certain thing.  I tend to mope around bored and lacking motivation to even get dressed.

Right now I'm still in my PJ's and it's 1:33 PM.

I can't enjoy any TV shows, movies, video games, nothing.  I scroll through TikTok, YouTube, Netflix, Crackle and other stuff, finding absolutely nothing to watch.  I looove cats, and can't even care about watching a cat video.

Going grocery shopping before delivery was a huge nightmare.  Too many people around, I was glad for the masking because it made me feel a little more hidden. I would see people's faces blur or distort, and I wouldn't be able to tell if a person near me was really there or not.

I once literally went psychotic in Wal-Mart near the bank waiting for my roommate and husband to meet back up with me.  The bank called the police about a suspicious person, gave them my description and location.  I had police with guns drawn on me and scared me shitless and believed the government was going to come after me to kill me and BOOM here they are.  I had to be held in Walmart in a tight hug for a while to calm me down before I could get myself to move.

The voices at that time were telling me that I'm about to be murdered, everyone is watching me, they expect me to rob the bank, they think I'm a criminal, you're going to be murdered, they're after you and then the police showed up.

One time I was talking to someone I found at the store that I've known for a long time, I'm in Alabama but he lives in Arizona.  I didn't think twice when I found him at the store and he started walking with me and chatting with me and people were just looking at me all fucked up and didn't realize why.

My ancestor, barely clinging to life, crawls to the nearest house and tells the man of the house what happened. The townspeople hunted these 2 men down and found them I think a week later and hung them. My ancestor passed away moments after finding out they'd caught his attackers.

When my ancestor's eldest daughter went to retrieve her father's body, the townspeople couldn't remember where they buried him. So I have an ancestor buried in some unmarked grave in a small Kentucky town.",AskReddit

However when I was about 12 or so her cousin died of lung cancer and I found her crying on the stairs cause she was so scared that her dad ended up in hell because she hadn't really forgiven him.

I worked my first shift and a man cussed me out for bringing him the salad dressing he asked for and his brother shattered a glass because I couldn't remember off the top of my head what he was drinking when he was in a party of 7. It wasn't the worst guest experience I'd ever had but when my other manager treated it like it was all my fault for not reading the guests minds I decided I was gonna quit a day early. I told everyone I wasn't gonna be working my second shift and no one believed me cause I'd worked there for 5 years and no one thought I'd actually leave. So when its time to switch to second shift I closed my section, cashed out at the bar, and walked out.

His friend had a list he'd given her the day before he killed himself of all the names of people who had bullied him. His friend gave the list to the principal who said the guys on the list were too important to sports teams to be held responsible so he ripped it up and threw it away in front of her in the hospital hallway outside the boys room where he was on life support.

The principal told parents he had an investigation done but found there was no bullying whatsoever in the high school. However, he never spoke to any of the boys friends or sister. Also, no one was ever offered grief counseling. The principal said it was an option but whenever someone asked they'd just tell them to get back to class.

Hes still the principal there despite dozens and dozens of parents going to the board of education trying to get him fired over the last like decade. When I was a junior we literally had proof that he'd go golfing 3 or 4 days a week while school was in session.

He makes himself look like a fool regularly, rarely apologizes when he's in the wrong/spreading clear misinformation, and pokes so many bears it's unbelievable.

 I'm very interested in craftsmanship so I do woodworking and I'm a member of multiple clubs in my area that focus on those. I'm part of my local blacksmith guild and the woodworkers guild. 

They meet every once in a while now. It used to be one a week but well, covid. 

We meet and hang out, you pay dues and can pick and choose which meetings to go to. Having something in common makes it easy to bond with people and the groups have different age ranges as well. There's drinking and smoking of course but that's wholly optional and is like a few beers here and there.

username#00464,comment,2022-03-28 17:25:03,,"...it's dehumanizing for someone to be a mother that adds an orphan but not dehumanizing to call children crotch goblins? What???

I haven't seen the other replies yet (and I probably won't bc reddit is obsessed with thinking people who don't like children are cooler for it) but I think you might get bogged down by internet ideals vs real life actions...

Depending on their age many children do feel 'left out' because of a new child and even moreso if it's two. But I think it would also be interesting to compare the two newcomers as the story progresses.

The orphan could feel like more a part of a family if they're helping take care of their newborn sibling, and eventually the older would be elated to have younger siblings to love. Or the older, seeing that they not only have live up to their mothers heroic actions, also has to tackle helping raise children they didn't sign up for.

Seeing your mother do all these incredible power things while also dealing with literal crybabies and also doing x y z as well... It could make anyone feel a bit unworthy or not as special in comparison. 

But back to the mother herself. That's a story I would read. The sacrifice of work, power, etc. that women feel is a worsening issue nowadays. My sister feels like she should adopt because she would love to have a family but she's too focused on moving up in her company to settle down/find a husband.

Why can't a woman have children and be successful? 

Children aren't 'crotch goblins', they're humans under development, capable of galvanizing their parents to strive for more. Capable of loving and putting in so much work to make their parents happy. Capable of repaying their parents for all the pain they cause as part of growing up.

Plus, if you want to explore some story avenues the MC wouldn't necessarily have the power/characterization to do, the extensions of her, her children, could help you with that.",writing

He loves Minecraft, and Roblox. He doesn't like fortnite it just doesn't seem to be his thing even though it is the ""big thing"" with kids his age. I personally play a little bit of everything, but I like games that allow for a lot of progression and that you can put a lot of time into such as MMORPGs. I also love FPS games (especially the old ones such as Blood, DOOM 1/2, Heretic, ect.). I love strategy games (turn based, RTS, 4X, ect.). I also love Minecraft and survival games like it (but I grew up when Minecraft was the big thing and played it since it first released so Minecraft has become very dry to me. Roblox really isn't my thing either. I just really want to find a game that will bring us together to have some fun, and give us some laughs, or even to get sad, or serious about. I want to get hooked on something with him. Our mother is a very iffy person, I avoid her, while he adores her so it kinda gets in the way of bonding since I live strictly with our dad, and he switch's back and forth constantly, but I really want do have a good bond with him, and not let our different views on my mom get in the way of our relationship so the best way I can think to do that is gaming. Please suggest some games you think would fit my need I play pretty much every genre so don't worry about my taste we both have PC, Xbox, and Switch so any game on any of those consoles will do. I know this is I guess kinda a half rant, but I would love to have a game we can both get hooked on and enjoy playing together to heal and grow our bond as brothers. 

Edit: game ratings don't matter. I grew up playing rated M games, and I'm not concerned about him playing them either.",gaming

Periods are a normal thing and nothing you should hide. I could understand if you showed them a used one (I assumed this based on the title), lol. 

My fiancee carries pads in her bag, I carry her pads, some Midol,  Excedrin, and an extra pair of undergarments in all my backpacks, and in the console of my car for her just incase of emergencies. I've never met a guy who was afraid or felt weird about seeing period products that weren't 13. The person who was surprised was probably just surprised you showed it to him or felt awkward for assuming you had another KitKat. I was initially surprised with how open my fiancee was when we first started dating about it, but not disgusted. I was just surprised because before that none of my friends who were girls or previous romantic relationships ever talked about it, so it was something I knew happened to women, but not something I knew anything about.

Plus, America has been very lenient with their gun laws since the beginning. 

And they would have to make a rule for the more rural areas to allow then to have guns as well, since in a lot of rural America wildlife pose a very big danger, bears, coyotes, wolves, mountain lions, etc.

Would it be more convenient to go to a dispensary and actually know what you are getting, sure. But definitely not easier, nor harder to buy from Bob. 

Also, that'd be a bad business practice to buy a glock for  around $500 to sell it for around $200. The firearms were most likely illegally trafficked, not bought legally from a gun shop. He also was advertising them as ""ghost guns"" meaning they either had the serials scratched off, or never had them begin with.",oddlyterrifying
username#00468,comment,2023-03-31 19:09:14,,"While I respect your argument, I strongly disagree. 

As someone who used to buy weed from a dealer (it's not legal where I am) from the age of 13-15ish he sold glocks as well. I could have bought an illegal clock off of him for around $200 and I was 14 when he offered to sell one to me as well. It's just as easy to buy a gun illegally as is it to buy weed. 

We all have our own experiences and our own beliefs. As I said before, I respect yours, but I just don't agree with it. Especially for shooters who just want to get famous. Most school shooters seem to steal them from their parents, but I feel in those situations it's the parents fault, you should never have a firearm that is accessible to a minor, or anyone other than yourself for that matter and I feel they should he a lot stricter with those rules.",oddlyterrifying
username#00468,comment,2023-03-31 07:42:33,,"Unfortunately it's not that easy. Other countries never had openly flowing guns the way the US has. 
There are more guns than people here and those are only the guns we know about. The US also has a lot of criminal activity (the cartels, larger criminal organizations), mostly in the southern most states and believe me they will profit majorly on firearms, just like they profit so much from drugs. 

Also, not to mention the fact that criminals don't follow the law. You can outlaw stuff all you want, but a criminal is a criminal, they don't follow the rules. 
You can't just suddenly make more than 300,000,000+ guns disappear, or suddenly take those way. 

I do agree that we need to get stricter on all of this stuff. It doesn't make sense that you need to be 21 to drink, or smoke, but you can buy a firearm, and join the military at 18. I think that that alone is insane, but for some reason no one bats an eye. I can be fresh out of high-school and purchase a long gun, but god forbid I grab a beer. 

Another issue is Healthcare, and mental health services are expensive, and a lot more taboo here. A lot of these kids need mental help. No normal 16 year old decides they want to kill others. Parents need to talk to their kids, and bullies need to have actual consequences. I don't know if you've looked into it, but bullying is more present in the US than almost all other western countries. Bullys in other countries seem to actually get jn trouble for their harassment. Here in the US the victim needs to stand up for themselves before the school actually gets involved which is absolute bullshit. 

Then there are the ""clout-shooters"" shooters that do it just for the purpose of being ""known"", again this is a mental health issue. Who in their right mind would want to be ""known"" in this way. Same as the Tumblr girls who fantasize school shooters, and serial killers. 

Also not to mention, even stricter background checks. I understand background checks now are considered strict, but let's be honest, most likely an 18 year old entering the criminal world isn't gonna have an existing record yet, which is why I believe they should push all legal gun purchases up to 21, and maybe set the drinking age back to 18. Just feels like the people have their priorities backward.

username#00468,comment,2022-05-25 19:27:16,,"100%. Though I will say, knife wounds have the potential to be worse than say your average 9mm, or AR1 wound/(within reason, of course if you get shot multiple times, or for comparison stabbed multiple times it's not going to be a good day.). Knives (especially dull knives) don't cut cleanly and do more damage overall. Also not to mention rust, or anything like that. The same could also be said for a bullet, though bullets heat up and burn around 200+ (this also varies on which modern firearm, but this is from my research the lowest temp. I encourage anyone reading this to do their own research as well as many sources contradict each other.).

A clean bullet wound, is normally easier to treat than a messy knife wound. 


I honestly just want all this crap to stop. We shouldn't have to worry about our children going to school. But I also know even if we do fix the gun issue it will happen in other ways too. People are sickos. We also need to start treating mental health more seriously, along with making it more accessible.

username#00468,comment,2022-05-25 18:03:21,,"I believe gun laws need to be way stricter, but not stripped. 

I also wouldn't compare America to most other countries since we have had free-flowing guns in our country since before the beginning, and the fact that there are WAY more guns than people in our country (not counting illegal ghost guns). 

I personally don't believe outright banning them would be a good move it's just not the same as say the UK, or Australia. And the UK's gun violence just forced criminals, and drug gangs to resort to knives, and other weapons. While knives aren't as easily used as saying a 9mm, it hasn't halted the violence, or the gangs, just their way of ""solving problems"". 

I think it should be more difficult to buy, and own a gun in the US. Any 18-year-old shouldn't be able to buy a rifle from their local gun store. Hell, they can't even legally drink, or smoke yet. The US is pretty ass-backward with a lot of things. It's nowhere near perfect, and something NEEDS to be done about this issue.

These choking incidents have been happening randomly since she was born and not many people IRL don't seem to understand the level of terror the two of us are going through.,"My 8 week old daughter has been choking at unpredictable moments since she was born. The only thing the doctor can tell me is that it's severe acid reflux and the medicine should be here later this week.

Just now was bad enough I had to call 911. Luckily every other time she has stopped breathing (truly, I lost count long ago) we have been able to intervene within seconds (the longest goddamn seconds) but that has meant we watch her eat, watch her sleep, so we don't really sleep, because it happens when she wakes up sometimes, and it means that if both of us have to sleep (we are avoiding that as much as possible but a person just crashes eventually) it means if she wakes up and isn't loud and it happens and...

Then this time... fuck. Normal, practiced, intervention wasn't working.  I was too far away from the bedroom so my screaming wasn't waking my husband. Seconds were piling up. I don't know how many. Phones are harder to work in that state. All I could think about was the math of how long it would take to actually get here and what would happen if I stopped doing absolutely everything I could.

She began breathing on the call. I got to say help wasn't needed today, and then she was peacefully sleeping in my arms after finishing a bottle like nothing had happened. Finally after typing this I can cry. 

I'm not too tired so much as I would never sleep again if I had any guarantee it would save her.",TrueOffMyChest

If it helps, there's a huge advantage to just checking in with your partner every so often during the act. Not every other trust, but say, it's been 5-10 minutes, or maybe they make a painful or stressed face, just say ""do you need a break?"" or ""how are you?""

There's a stereotypical pressure put on men to just know everything during sex and do it all perfectly without having to ask. You can/should ask preferences, since one woman might want extended penis-in-vagina sex while others will prefer mostly clitoral stimulation with shorter intervals of penetration throughout the session (my preference).

Not checking in might come from needing to be seen as competent that way, but you should do it for their comfort, and it should be appreciated. If someone gives you a really hard time for being respectful to them, they probably have some things to work out for themselves.

So you still need to go through each step and analyze as you go to make decisions about which option to choose and when, but sometimes the algorithm only needs repeated once to get the step done, other times you'll have to do the step 2-3 times.

From what this millenial has experinced, I haven't had any pushback for simply saying ""a black/brown person"" when it's actually relevant, but in the most inclusive circles ""people of color"" is very common to describe anyone brown or black. This can sound confusing since ""colored people"" is unacceptable in comparison, but think of the first two as focusing on the person with their color being more of a description, while the next example focuses more on the color than the person. It's subtle, but more person centric. ""African American"" is also out usually because black people can originate from lots of places other than Africa. If they really did immigrate or want to be called by that term it's more of a personal choice.

Men tend to chose more sudden or hard to escape methods more often. Women also tend to choose more slow, painful methods. Statistically. 

But take the research on jumping. I see it as a mix of fast and slow... Once you jump you can't return to the ledge, and yet it takes long enough to get to the bottom that most people who survived the attempt knew they didn't want to die by the time they were free falling and regretted the jump. Instinct is powerful. 

Regardless of why some people choose one method or the other, it seems to stand to reason that women survive suicide attempts more often since the chosen methods are usually much slower with time for instinct to kick in and help to arrive. With a gun, there's not often time for regret or for instinct while you're actively dying unless it happens to miss.

username#00472,comment,2022-01-30 06:47:26,,"Oh yes, absolutely. I think that choosing your own language for your situation is vital. Person centric should be the default, and I'm certainly not offended (at all) by that language being the default. On the other hand, some of us feel so ingrained into our condition (some schizophrenics specifically) that it's not something that could be separated.

Some have mild symptoms or found a good enough treatment plan, that they might prefer person centric because they feel it's just a part of them now and not what they want to focus on. Others are fighting the stigma the only way they know how. Others may have reasons I just can't know.

Me, it's my everyday. I think about it everyday, and it's become a huge part of my life. It's changed my personality to a degree, it alters my perception so that I have to constantly examine things for reality, and makes me think and act differently than I used to.

The first first of two times I have overdosed, I swallowed thirty xanax pills and drank a couple beers. Slept for 26 hours.  


The next time I intentionally overdosed, I decided to play a game of Lazarus on myself. I chugged a liter of 180 proof alcohol, along with having taken a number of drugs including DXM, DPH, Psilocybe cubensis, Datura inoxia, caffeine, and amphetamine.  


Needless to say my mind was kinda fucked for a few years. But I survived. Today is what I'm hoping will be my last day of using marijuana.

I wanted a DXM trip but the cough syrup I bought had DPH in it which is a deleriant. Everyone told me how dangerous it was & I researched it & read trip reports most of which describes a horrible trip with paranoia, hallucinations, confusion & vomiting.

I took it anyway. It started to kick in. I felt like my entire body was on fire. I made myself vomit to try and flush it out of my system but it was pretty much too late. I sat on the edge of my bed, my hands covering my face, rocking back and forth.

I started experiencing thought loops, the same thoughts over and over. I felt like my mind was spitting into fragments. It felt painful to be conscious. I wanted to call 999 because I felt so unsafe & I knew it was only going to get worse and the effects were going to last another few hours. I was tripping alone in my room. I picked up my penknife. I thought about stabbing myself in the head multiple times because all I wanted was for it to stop & killing myself seemed like the best option to just end the trip.

I didn't go through with it thank god but I was so close and that scares me. I lay down, took some meds to make me drowsy & I eventually passed out, luckily before any hallucinations could start.

I have learned a big lesson from the experience but I still feel uneasy 24 hours later. Is it possible the drug is still in my system. I'm hoping by tomorrow I'll be back to normal.

I will never touch this drug again. It is literally Satan's syrup. I know that I was stupid for not listening to everyone who told me not to take it. But seriously if you're thinking of taking it don't. It will fuck you up, there are so many better drugs out there. It's a cheap trip but the levels of fucked up you'll become won't be worth it.

I've heard you can have a bad trip on DPH but I'm 50/50 on taking it because I don't want to waste what I bought.,"I had initially planned to take 150mg of DXM by itself but the stuff I got from the pharmacy contains 350mg DPH aswell. They didn't have a wide selection so I went with Benylin Dry Cough syrup.

They didn't sell anything with just DXM as the main ingredient so I'm planning to go to a bigger store. But until then I don't want to waste what I bought.

I've done some research & a lot of people are saying that DPH can be a really bad trip. Nausea, Paranoia, Hallucinations, Memory problems, erratic behaviour etc.

One part of me is cautious but I also have a morbid curiosity. If I take it & start losing touch with reality will I still have some control over my behaviour? Because people have said they go into the trip knowing what to expect but they end up thinking the hallucinations are real.

If I take it it'll be a one time thing for sure. I'm gonna think about it a while longer and then I'll make my decision but I wanted to see if others could weigh in their opinions. Also would the DXM make any difference to the trip as opposed to me just taking DPH?",Drugs

It's just after Christmas so I don't even have any money to give him. But I also don't trust he's telling the truth. What does he gain from this because it feels really shady. I haven't messaged him back yet I will if anyone can give me advice.

So will taking 3mg Xanax give me a nice buzz by itself or should I smoke a zoot first?",Drugs

username#00476,post,2018-11-26 15:52:48,I've started carrying a knife & I'm worried that one day I'll use it,"I'm 24. I live in a small town in Ireland & I was diagnosed with schizophrenia 3 years ago.

A few months back I heard multiple news reports of teenage gangs in my town and nearby towns. Kids were getting jumped, mugged & a few threatened with knives. Two kids were stabbed but their wounds were non fatal.

I'm paranoid because of the schizophrenia. I constantly worry about people breaking into my house & killing me which leads to obsessively checking all doors are locked. The past week I started carrying a knife with me whenever I leave the house.

If I'm caught with the knife it could be a 1000 fine and up to 12 months in prison. But I don't feel safe without it.

But what I'm more worried about is the thoughts that accompany my behaviour. The knife makes me feel powerful. If someone is walking behind me I put my hand in my pocket and hold the knife. I've had multiple fantasies of threatening people with the knife and them being scared of me. I've started dressing in a more intimidating way. Always have my hood up and half my face concealed.

All of this scares me. Could I be capable of actually hurting someone? I don't want to fuck my life up even more. I would be killed in prison.

I'm being honest when I say the mental health thing obviously goes in my favour but I know it's not a great excuse for carrying a concealed weapon. But it helps me feel like I'm not defenceless if something were to happen.

I've spent 5 months in the psych ward this year (3 separate admissions). I feel like I can't tell my doctor about any of this for the risk that I'll be put back in hospital and I don't want to ruin my family's Christmas. I'm at a loss on what I should do.

I told myself that if I really thought I was going to hurt someone then I'd call the police on myself and suffer the consequences.",confession

There was 5 of us taking it. We lit a fire outside as we waited for it to kick in. Then we watched A Scanner Darkly. Such a great movie to trip to. I felt like the movie was spilling out of the TV & into the real world. After the movie was over we all chilled out & enjoyed some closed eye visuals.

But the second time I took 4acodmt I was alone & I had a similar trip to the DPH. I was in the shower & I had that feeling of it being painful to be conscious. Then I started getting the thought loops & the feeling of my mind splitting into fragments.

Then, it was as if I was watching myself. I saw my body floating listlessly through a water-cooler vision. I remember a sharp red stripe on my bathing suit, stark against the black stripes next to it. My hair was waving above me, my eyes closed and body still. From the viewpoint a hand dove in towards me. As soon as it touched my arm, it pulled. In that exact second time came back, my body shook and I gasped in air. 

I still think about it randomly sometimes. I wonder just what happened to make me see myself. That and how everything seemed to be in slow-motion oddly enough. Though, I still can't swim to this day.",AskReddit

username#00485,comment,2019-04-16 18:56:26,,"I am a woman, but I'm going to answer this because I love fat men. Something about them seems softer, sweeter yet they still keep the manlike rugged quality. I don't know, they seem more like family men, at least the ones I've met. There's a cuteness to them. And yes, I like them from chubby to obese to way obese. However, there is a point where I'm more worried about their health than their attractive qualities. I myself am 300ibs. Maybe I just feel more comfortable with people who know my struggles health-wise. I don't feel like I'm trying to prove that I'm a good person despite my weight. Despite this, when I was skinny and worked out daily, I was still attracted to them. 

&#x200B;

I know men attracted to me despite my weight issues. They both love the softness as well. One has told me that no matter the woman, they find attractive qualities. They believe all women's bodies are beautiful, and mean it. The other told me that the thickness and marks along the skin are beautiful to them. 

&#x200B;

It's all about preferences, everyone has them, but most do not conform to the ideal standards set by society. I believe that the more weight a person has, the softer they look to others. More welcoming, sweeter. Either way, I will work on my body in future when I am in a better place, yet I will still look toward the bigger people for relationships.",AskMen

I thought a centre of a mountain as it would take a lot of processing and rendering, but it could make for a cool global project to attempt to make a mountainside microcosmic Moon. It'd be like Atlas, who's head and shoulders which Perseus turned into an entire mountain range. Imagine if the global nervous system that is the internet is Atlas and we turn all its nerves to map the moon and perhaps other worlds and planets one day?

username#00490,comment,2022-06-11 01:25:22,,"I think ""church"" has left a bad taste in most of our mouths, or a bad concept in our heads since it is defined as pretty much a place where ""Christians"" go to worship, per Oxford Dictionary. However, I don't think all ""churches"" have the same dogma. I think some, like the one I'm planning to attend, which states they are pro-LGBTQIA+ safe space, has people of all backgrounds, lifestyles, spiritual or non-spiritual beliefs. There are also gay affirming denominations of Christianity, one being Pentacostal, per Google. (Lol, per Google)

A portion from the Church of Satan website:

""What does the Church of Satan think about homosexuality?
We fully accept all forms of human sexual expression between consenting adults. The Church of Satan has always accepted gay, lesbian, bisexual and asexual members since its beginning in 1966. This is addressed in the chapter ""Satanic Sex"" in The Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey.

What about gay marriage?
We support the legalization of gay marriage. See this essay by Peter H. Gilmore, ""Founding Family,"" to understand why. Also this essay explores why allowing this civil right to become legal has found resistance.

Does the Church of Satan accept transgender people?
Yes. We have done so since the organization was founded in 1966. The Church of Satan's philosophy promotes individuals empowering themselves so as to seek personal satisfaction. Magus Anton LaVey embraced people from the entire LGTBQ spectrum wholeheartedly-and well in advance of most other religious organizations-and Magus Gilmore proudly maintains that position. We consider it intrinsic to Satanism to support our fellows' search for fulfillment so long as it involves other consenting mature, self-aware adults, even when our own pursuits are different. As Magus LaVey wrote in his essay Diabolica: ""Man prides himself on being the only animal who can modify his Nature, yet when he chooses to do so he is called a phony."" We in the Church of Satan support the decision to modify one's nature employing whatever means are available should one choose that path to attain fulfillment.

If one of our members wishes a membership card reflecting a name change due to a gender identity different from when they originally joined, please supply proof of your updated legal ID for our records. We will then supply an updated membership card.""",atheism

Plus, ""immorality"" can be argued as subjective to some different religious & cultural beliefs. Some religions use necrophilia as part of their rituals.

From Wikipedia:

Ero guro (Japanese: ) is an artistic genre that puts its focus on eroticism, sexual corruption, and decadence.[1] As a term, it is used to denote something that is both erotic and grotesque.

The term itself is an example of wasei-eigo, a Japanese combination of English words or abbreviated words: ero from erotic and guro from grotesque.[2] The ""grotesqueness"" implied in the term refers to things that are malformed, unnatural, or horrific.[1] Items that are pornographic and bloody are not necessarily ero guro, and vice versa. The term is often mistaken by Western audiences to mean ""gore"" - depictions of horror, blood, and guts.

...

Ero guro nansensu's first distinct appearance began in 1920s and 1930s Japanese literature. The Sada Abe Incident of 1936, where a woman strangled her lover to death and castrated his corpse, struck a chord with the ero guro nansensu movement but shortly led to the censorship of related media.[5] Other similar activities and movements were generally suppressed in Japan during World War II, but re-emerged in the postwar period, especially in manga and music.[6]",oddlyterrifying

username#00490,comment,2022-04-29 18:50:36,,"Let me try to explain my thoughts, cuz this is a complex topic. This is a thought criminal thing. Lol! I love that phrase because I am a thought criminal all the time.

You & I had the same thoughts when I first came across this content, including BDSM porn. In America,  remember the Betty Page era, they sold bondage/extreme porn with her or others in brown bags behind the counter. It was considered immoral, if not illegal in some states, to be caught with this stuff. It was an outlet for a fetish, very mild too compared to guro, I think we agree on that.

But then started the REALLY extreme content about a decade later, where we have serial killers like Ted Bundy whom obsessed over it. Some killers telling us their dad introduced them to it. All those people didn't have professionals to evaluate the effects of this stuff back then, or when it's being passed around from mentally ill parents to their children. This was before it was made legal, or regulated, or ""explainable"" to others that don't like the BDSM fetish. Also before we could get help for kids living in a violent or sexual environment. Hell, did people even consider those things back then?

Yes, this shit will break a kid's mind. Yes, this shit is offensive, & horrifying. It's not for everyone tho! But that's the point of it too. Ero-Guro has a long history too.

Everyone is worshipping, calling in the holy spirit, & the preacher is taking people on stage to bless. A girl went before me. He touched her forehead & she started shivering & shaking. They grabbed her a blanket, hugged her, sat her in the pew. Then they pulled me on stage. He put his hands on my forehead & I felt NOTHING. I felt like I was doing something wrong!!

I stopped believing around 16, I think. My mom never made us go to church & it wasn't like a super Christian household, but she still had some stupid conservative beliefs, like being gay is wrong, white people are god's chosen, mental health required almost getting an exorcism. Ugh...

I wasn't really perfect for them but I really love my parents for taking care of me. My mom is a stubborn/adamant woman and assumes things early. Dad is mostly honest but has lied three or four times, and does stuff behind our back often. But extremely nice to me. My parents have anger issues but my moms worse. 
The thing is since a few months my dad usually gets a phone call right after coming home with mom, and leaves the house and he says he is going out to drink beer etc. and recently my mom has been accusing him of sleeping with other women (aka cheating). Their arguments are really big. My dad keeps denying it, but my mom is well, stubborn and is adamant my dad is cheating. I'm afraid they might divorce. A few days ago my dad both admitted that he slept with other girls but also denied it in the same conversation??? Idk who to trust. I really like my dad cuz he's funny and buys me gifts, I also like my mom but we have never had proper conversations recently. When I was a kid my dads anger issues were real big. He slapped and hit me when I made a small mistake. My mom too but my mom was a verbal abuser(?). I forgave my dad cuz he can manage his anger fairly now, my mom still hurts me with her words sometimes. My mom keeps saying she'll take me and my siblings away to my older brother's new house, I'm not sure if I want to stay with her. I just need advice on how to stay calm during their arguments and generally how to process it.",Advice

username#00494,comment,2022-12-27 00:39:57,,"Okay so happy tree friends is an adult cartoon styled in a childish way and animation where things seem normal and innocent at first but then most of the animals in the episodes die but they revive and come back, so they're an endless loop of suffering and dying and reviving. Lumpy is the one with the most kill count over 300 but he kills accidentally, Fliqpy the ptsd embodiment of Flippy always kills intentionally. Well half intentionally he hallucinates the tree friends as the enemy tiger soldiers from war so he kills them but still follows the soldier code so he doesn't kill children like Cub the son of Pop and those who can't defend themselves like Flaky in party animal who was inflated because of her peanut allergy and Handy who has amputated lower arms (tho he always chops off Handys legs in a way, fliq can't kill people like Handy but can injure them) 

Okay so Flippy got PTSD from war when he was in Weaponized Animal Regiment and in a Kapow episode, Operation: Tiger Bomb, he accidentally kills his 2 friends Sneaky and Mouse Kaboom and has to hide in Sneakys corpse to hide from Tiger General and Tiger Soldiers so whenever something reminds him of war he flips out and becomes Fliqpy and just kills. Other than his trauma Flippy is one of the most sociable characters and is very nice. 

Then there's Shifty and Lifty who are twin brothers and they're thieves, they always steal from other characters in the show and sell stuff sometimes. They have an iconic laugh in the show and won't be afraid to sacrifice each other if it means they get what they want as shown in an episode where Shifty turns into golden and sinks under water and Lifty tries to pull him up to sell him but drowns, also another episode where their air balloon is going near an electric thingy wire so Shifty pushes Lifty down

There's Giggles and Petunia who are presumably best friends. Petunia is a very tidy person and idk if its canon but i think she has OCD? and he and Handy are dating their relationship is canon and you can check the ""I nub you"" episode for it. Giggles is a feminine chipmunk and does girly stuff she's dating Cuddles. She also has a confirmed parent, Giggles'  mom who's the only confirmed parental figure in the show after Pop. 

Handy is ironically a handless worker and he often does stuff that require use of hands and most of the time he either does that thing or dies while trying to do it, he builds houses, puts on lamps etc. And babysitted Cub once but suffered injuries

Idk much about cuddles but he's a yellow rabbit and his most common death style is his insides getting ripped out in some way an example is when Fliqpy used his guts to suffocate and kill Giggles. 

Toothy is a beaver like Handy but purple, Toothy mostly dies from eye injury stuff and is friends with Cuddles and is shown to spend time with him, as shown in Double Whammy part 2 aka autopsy turvy

Then there's Flaky who's a red porcupine and her gender is REALLY debated in the fandom and even in the show and by creators but I'll call her a she/her since most people call her that. She has anxiety and is generally timid and shy, she's mostly shipped with Flippy in the fandom. However she's really afraid of Flippy in the show in later episodes because she becomes aware of Flippy's PTSD and is scared he'll flip out. I think it was shown in an episode but i forgor the name

Lammy is a purple lamb but she wears a white hoodie. She's headcanonned as schizophrenia in the fandom and i didnt watch most episodes about her but there's Mr. pickles who kills and turns into an inanimate pickle when caught and shifts the Blame on Lammy in a way. She appears in the Royal flush episode tho

Then there's also Splendid who  is a blue squirrel and is supposed hero of the town but whenever he tries to save somebody it almost always results in death as when he tried to save a crutched Giggles from a tsunami and she got beheaded by a tree branch when they were flying. 

Sniffles is an anteater and is somehow some of a doctor, scientist, something tldr smart guy of the town. He's light blue and has dark blue glasses. He has some episodes of trying to eat an ant family but the ants always kill him in a way lol

Mime is the well mime of the town he's a purple deer but has a white face mask and white & very dark burple striped shirt. He can't speak, but basically can touch and pretend stuff are there when they're not. So miming. He has a death where Fliqpy forced him to drink gasoline and then shot an arrow on fire into his chest so Mimes insides caught on fire in Double Whammy part 1. 

Cro-marmot... Exists. He's inside a frozen ice block and is dressed like a cave man.

Lumpy is i think a moose or a deer and the only one with a different physical structure. He's more taller than anyone else and is blue but has low fucking iq he kills everyone on accident. 

Disco Bear is an orangeish bear who flirts with everyone. He has these stereotypical disco man big orange hair u get what i mean. His pick up line is ""oh yeah"" and he dances. A lot. He is shown to consume lots of unhealthy food and even though he goes to the gym he's still overweight. 

Pop and Cub are 2 bears. Pop is Cub's father and tries his best to be  good father but Cub often gets injured or die anyway. It's unknown where Pop's wife is, the fandom thinks she's either dead or went to get... Milk? 

Nutty is a green squirrel who's hyperenergetic and has a big ass candy addiction. He has an episode where he marries a candy box, then a heart shaped chocolate box and has chocolate box kids with the chocolate box. 

The mole is blind and does lots of blind stuff, he is light purpleish and doesn't really notice what's happening around him. 

Russel is i think also a beaver and he's a sailor, he has a hooked hand and an eye patch. 

As ones who aren't in the main show

Sneaky is one of Flippys old comrades. He's a  Chameleon and can become invisible at will. He dies when Flippy accidentally stabs him because he's invisible and Flippy doesn't notice. 

Mouse Kaboom is a small and short mouse who has  big ass backpack of bombs. He dies when he tries to throw a bomb at the Tiger general but it covers in cheese and gets back at him then gets stuck on his hands and he panics and goes to Flippy for help but it's too late and it explodes and he dies

Tiger General and Tiger soldiers are the enemies of MK, Sneaky and Flippy. Tiger General fights with Fliqpy after Fliqpy kills all his Tiger soldiers but he dies too, and gets made into a pizza by Fliqpy afterwards. 

Then theres Buddhist monkey but i never watched him all i know is there's big black evil and then ninjas and he fights the ninjas to defeat big black evil",memes

Psych meds can work wonders for people. They are the reason I can function as a human being everyday. Before that I was failing classes, now my grades are high, even in harder classes. I can focus. I have motivation. I can live, and so can he, which is why the op needs to make an appointment with a __psychiatrist__ ASAP and same with a therapist. You might have to experiment with a few different therapists until you find one you like. Don't give up on therapy altogether because you don't like the first one. 

Start off each day with making an honest list of everything you need to do. If you don't get to something one day, it goes at the top of the list with a star the next day. You can do this in the notes in your phone even.

I can't speak for MFP about this, but FatSecret has options that if you are more self-conscious, you can hide your weight progress from either everyone, or everyone except friends.

In that respect, your weight loss trials will be just as challenging as someone who needs to lose 100+ (such as myself, lol.)  Since I am so overweight, I can lose weight simply by limiting my calorie intake to about 1200 a day, with almost no extra exercise.  

Since you are closer to a healthy weight, you'll have to do a bit of exercise I'm sure.  It doesn't have to be too strenuous, just enough to burn more than you take in (and you already burn a lot just by doing nothing, surprisingly).  If anything starts hurting, take a break, you shouldn't push yourself too hard.

I don't know if you'll be able to lose 15 pounds in a month, but every little bit helps, you know?  Lose around 5 pounds a month for 3 months, and look amazing for summer vacation.  I wish you the best of luck on your journey.",loseit

A.i algorithms that can predict your behaviours,  A.i voiced videos, bot accounts, dead internet theory and content-farming accounts that have no function other than to literally taint the internet. The worst part about all of it, is that it fucking *works*. Society and that's not to exclude myself gets eventually caught on this cesspool and it drives me insane. 90% of things I see are just mindless reposts of older videos, memes, or just people outright copying others for the same thing. Everyone hops onto the bandwagon.

Content creators inserting meme sound effects every 20/30 seconds to keep people entertained or just being so egregiously loud and brazen. Or videos like ""This happened to X, you wont believe what happened next!"" Videos being plagued with ads, subscription based services eye-gouging customers for the exact same package and hiking up prices - And lets not forget that being subscribed to the same internet provider/ company will inevitably just hike up your price for no fucking reason; loyalty doesn't mean shit to companies now and I swear it's deliberate to constantly make us deal with the hassle of cancelling, finding another and signing up again. 

So much content has been lost as well due to companies just outright killing things off. Buy a game? ""Nevermind, even though you bought it, it's not yours anymore, no refunds."" When did things get this fucking braindead? I'm tired of this shit where corporate companies just shit on your decisions for profit and all of the like.

To combat this, with 1 hour of testing of not full job blocks ( E.g Brewing stands, Grindstones and stonecutters), this issue is no longer present. If you somehow catch a villager taking suffocation damage with these blocks, respond with a video and i'll call this fix off!

If I wanted to create & install a mod on an older version of Minecraft, lets say for instance Beta 1.5 - Is it possible and is there anything that I should be aware of?

So, being the age I am and having the common knowledge to know that facial hair normally comes after puberty, is there any reason why I'm not getting any? I've got very little to almost none; i've never had to shave it because there's not enough - However, a worthy mention is that I do get spots round the region and something tells me there's a connection between the two.

Despite me being on the same medication for around 3 years now, i've noticed some very destructive personality changes that have took control for the past month or so which is giving clarity in that i'm not getting better. My current medication stated above knocks me out for 16 hours of the day, if not more and makes me drowsy and apathetic constantly for a whole week (and keeping in mind these I have to take one on a daily basis).

I have told both my psychiatrist and medical assessor that my meds do this and they wont seem to get the message across on what it's doing to my health; I can't eat because I'm sleeping all the time therefore i'm losing weight and not getting what I need, I can't function and they are reluctant in changing my meds even with me telling them constantly. Within the past month, i've been experiencing a serious amount of a depression: No motive to do anything, pushing all my friends and family away, anxiety from this 'phase' im going through is permanent or will be around for even longer than what it is.

So my question is, if my medication is doing the aforementioned, should I seek a new psychiatrist? Because no matter how much I tell them, I'm not getting anywhere and waking up feeling depressed every day is seriously getting to me on both a personal, physical and mental scale.

Backstory: My dad hit his shin *real hard* on a concrete slab, didn't go to the ER. After a year of the incident, he was sent for an X-ray which didn't show anything - he's had an ultrasound and the people that did it said there was > ""Fluid under the muscle and doesn't look right"" and **2 years later** it still hasn't healed properly with moderate to severe pain, scarring, discolouration to the leg and foot. He has a gait walking on the leg, and is constantly shiny compared to his other leg. Overall throughout his entire body, his skin is **very* frail, if he were to brush up against a rough surface like a tree, his skin would peel, scar over and bleed a lot, much like that consistency of water instead of blood and the skin bruises way more than it should for something small. Before you say ""But he's getting old"" I had someone in my family who lived to 84 and didn't have extensive bruising compared to this. He also (though could be unrelated) wakes up on a daily basis getting severe cramps in said leg, though he never got them before this incident

He recently was referred to the hospital for physiotherapy and one of the doctors said > ""Where he's had the pain for so long (Because my dad has said that if it cured the pain, cut the damn thing off) his brain is sending mixed signals because of the way he's thinking and that's why it's not healing properly""

Which is saying to me (his son) that it's psychological pain rather than physical - If you ask me is a load of bullshit because someone doesn't make up psychological pain after a physical event has happened to it. He hasn't had an MRI scan and the people who did an ultrasound of his leg/ shin said there's something clearly wrong with the fluid underneath the muscle, though no course of action has been taken.My question is: 

Instead of being referred (Because this process takes 3-6 months, if not more) , should he go to A&E and request an MRI? (I know it's not an emergency) but after 2 years of going round in circles through referrals and getting nowhere, he's angry, tired of going through loopholes and nothing is being done to manage the pain and with the aforementioned paragraph about it being psychological pain and not healing correctly, I came here to seek advice from other people/ doctors/ physicians.

Overview:

Friend smashed his shin on some concrete at a building site **a year ago** The wound healed but *very* slowly, talking over a 6 months (Not infected). The skin has remained shiny/ glossy. Upon hitting it, a month or two after, putting pressure on a particular spot at the heel causes immense, sharp pain. Other symptoms include loss of continence, numbness in the genitalia and tingling in the back of his legs. I wouldn't consider generic ""Aching"" of the entire body as a symptom but it could/(n't) be caused by it. Any cuts or bumps take a significantly long time to heal and leads to large bruises which the doctors says it's ""Old age"" but I disagree.

Doctors said it could be sciatica, have x-rayed the leg and heel but nothing has come up. An ultrasound on the leg revealed ""Fluid"" underneath the muscle but was never investigated. No CT Scan has been done. Upon my own further investigation, I researched something called ""Cauda equina syndrome"" Which explains most of the symptoms - And articles suggest if you suffer from the symptoms, you should go to A&E *Immediately*

Lastly, he experiences mild to severe dizziness where on some occasions, cant stand upright, feels nauseous and feels like everything is spinning; Many years ago ( I think at age 25, I can't specifically remember when he had this accident) concrete mixture fell into one of his eye's and he had to have the necessary chemicals to remove it which was successful - He still has vision in both eyes but I believe he's colorblind in one.

Focusing on the former rather than the latter, should he go to A&E? Any help is greatly appreciated.

username#00502,comment,2024-05-24 22:53:30,,"First time responding to a post on this sub; Guy here!

I'm gonna be as mindful and perceptive as possible with my responses, nor downplay any of the experiences women go through because I can say with certainty the situations that are bound to happen because of your looks and assholes (Yes, I will call them that instead of men) that decide to be inappropriate about their behaviours is unacceptable. I'd like to address a few points while being respectful!

Not every guy is built/ muscular/ tall as you might project, like myself. In reference to your point ""They walk to their cars without their keys between their fingers."", this isn't true. I've been a victim of mugging and I am hyper vigilant of my surroundings and due to my build, I am neither 'strong' or intimidating; in fact, underweight and an easy target - Happened once and almost a second time if I was not quick with my reactions. I have been mistaken for a woman too due to my long hair. Safe to say, men can be targets as well.

I'd highly disagree that men can show emotion because i've seen several posts about how melodramatic or 'over the top' men are about certain/ niche circumstances and the ridiculing behaviour makes them more recluse and binds them in how the world views them. Men will tend to hide them because societal standards project (Or rather that which is projected in media, film and of the like) that men have to be virtually emotionless otherwise they're too feminine or not 'Being a man'. Men are at greater risk of suicide and mental health issues because they're not taken seriously, and studies have shown that more men are becoming aimless because educational programs and schools are becoming more tailored towards women/ girls.

Fathers not being asked to continue work if their kid is born and 'not being judged negatively' is not true either. If you can't support your kid, I can safely say in any scope of rationality that men are HIGHLY judged if they don't; see the terms ""deadbeat father"" and 'not pulling their weight'. From what I've been able to read up, there's no nepotism in terms of what last name is given to a child, so ultimately if the mother wants to have their last name, that's not something that needs to be debated. If there's disagreement with that aspect, then some steps need to be taken back before becoming parents.

Some of your points do hold true and the stigmatization of what they incur is awful. 

I want to kindly add that Male privilege is not a term that one should throw out because everyone wants equality and there are equal parts to niche or particular circumstances that can be pointed in the opposite direction; and when it does get thrown out, it just creates further divide, contempt and reasons for both parties to start hating each other. Things are not always going to be up to scratch, some people wont change. All anyone can do is try and teach/ learn from our mistakes.

username#00511,comment,2021-01-14 07:06:52,,"The following is an actual question given on a University of Arizona   chemistry mid term, and an actual answer turned in by a student. 
Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?  
 
Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.
 
  One student, however, wrote the following:  
  First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.
 
Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.

This gives two possibilities:  

   1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.  
   2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.
So, which is it?
If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct....leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting...'Oh my God! Oh my God!'",AskReddit

However, the one thing I can't get past is the excessive amount of lazily written dialogue solely devoted to explaining every detail and why. This is mostly in the form of the protagonist's inner monologue, but sometimes it can go up a notch on the annoyance, when it is some random side character, that will explain *everything*.

username#00512,comment,2020-05-02 12:49:07,,"Just because a person isn't 'into politics', doesnt mean they are making an 'uninformed' vote. People in Flint, i doubt, want a 'return' to anything, nor does the black community, nor any community for whom their exploitation and discrimination is a cornerstone into how the current system (i.e. capitalism) is built. They want positive change and tangible improvements to their lives.

People will vote in their best interest, which happens to be distorted through capitalist institutions which tell them (explicitly or implicitly), that migrants are to blame for their problems, that tax cuts for the rich are a good idea (myth of the ""job creators"" and trickle down economics), and that the logic of capitalism is the be all and end all for how we structure this world, and that other possibilities are impossible/too expensive). 

Not to mention the fact that the working class, the people *objectively* best placed to change the system, are the ones for whom it is often hardest to vote - through decades of various forms of voter repression, most clearly, but also in marginalising them and hacking away at their spirit and their hope that things *can* get better in any way. Also, the obscurement of the objective relationship between the classes and the means of production as a way to make them feel powerless. 

This is why Trade Unions and Tenant unions are so important, because they are the main vehicle through which people become organised, fight for improvements in their pay and working conditions, against the social leeches (landlords), and fight for the political and economic change that will benefit them as a *class*. When the essential needs of everyone are met and people have democratic control of their workplace, when the ability of human labour is not sold for endless hours of monotony just to survive, I have no doubt we will be in an endlessly better situation.",worldnews

username#00512,comment,2016-03-12 10:12:18,,"What films would you classify as arthouse? Drive is usually considered arthouse and it's one of my favourite films of all time. The target demographic for so-called arthouse films are usually people a bit more in-tune with films, people with a slightly better knowledge of what classifies a ""good"" film, objectively speaking. Many arthouse films usually contain a message or a moral, like most other movies, but one which may be hidden on a metaphorical level. For example, A Clockwork Orange is widely considered to be an Arthouse movie, but it has a decisive message which it shows to its audience.

As for your question on whether or not they're meant to be entertaining or engaging. Well, sometimes I would imagine they are built for a political purpose e.g. Man of Iron, which criticized the Communist government in Poland. So, no, they are not always built to be entertaining on a superficial level, but they are often meant to be intellectually stimulating and politically/religiously/socially aware. However, it would be wrong if one were to say that arthouse films are intrinsically designed to not be entertaining. There are so many that, I personally, find to be entertaining, but this might be due to my enjoyment and appreciation of their value as important artistic pieces. Enjoyment is a subjective thing.

To answer 2A, the reason people couldn't consider ""Avatar"" to be masterpieces, even if the director told us it wasn't supposed to be enjoyed, is because even calling a film arthouse doesn't inherently mean it  is good. Films have to be analysed, and most art house films will have something in them *to* be analysed. Films like the Last Airbender do not. They have no importance whatsoever.

I hope this answers your questions.",movies

It follows the story of a girl, around 12 years old, that finds herself in the seventh basement of a hospital-like building. She has no memory of how she got there, and soon enough she finds an elevator to the next floor. She meets an assassin and makes a weird promise with him.

I won't spoil it, but it is amazing. I love the way it shows emotion and how well it introduces deep feelings and a heart-breaking story into this gory and ruthless plot.

It's just amazing. I would love to chat with someone about it, and hopefully get some of you to watch it.",CasualConversation

username#00520,post,2019-11-09 20:43:24,"I miss my (23F) manipulative ex (25M), how do I move on?","TL;DR: I left my ex (25M) after 6 years, and started seeing a close friend (31M) a little over a month ago. Absolutely loving 31M, but a big part of me misses 25M, despite him being emotionally abusive and manipulative.

There's no real way around it, my ex was manipulative and abusive. He cheated, lied, called me names, etc, but only during depressive episodes (he's bi-polar). He'd still make fun of me or call me names when he was more ""even"" (he's always been kind of mean, and he admits to it, as well as admitting it's the reason most of his past relationships ended), but otherwise was a romantic and loving person. We could both be accurately describes as ""hopeless romantics"". We both grew up a lot together and watched each other become fully functional adults. He was my first real love, my first sexual partner, and was my best friend for a long time.


Things broke down over time; he was always less sexual than me, he preferred to masturbate and would do it over having sex, a large point of contention between us. There were times we went 1-2 months without sex because he would turn me down in favor of masturbating, and only recently admitted it's an addiction for him. He would get into depressive episodes and become meaner and bitter towards me. He cheated on me. He went on a ""break"" twice to sleep with other women. He constantly compared me (negatively) to an ex of his from high school. He didn't want to get married and would push off the idea constantly, though he later would occasionally refer to me as his fiancee, we were never formally engaged and he'd still push off the idea of marriage. Things came to a head when he threw something at me during a fight and I left.


Three years ago, I met 31M. We became fast friends. Between our similar interests and senses of humor, we got along really well. About a year ago, we got closer and he became one of my best friends, and then quickly made it to best friend. We ended up hanging out a lot more (sometimes with 25M, sometimes with other friends, sometimes just us). I didn't think much of it, but he apparently developed feelings along the way, even before we became close. I would be lying if I said I hadn't developed a small crush as we got closer. He has always been a shoulder to cry on and someone I could vent to, and has always been a sweet, funny guy towards me. He looked out for me even when I would spiel on about 25M, even though he had feelings. 


Before my fight with 25M, he told me he had feelings. I brushed them off. After our fight, I started to reconsider. A little after I left, we got together. My time with him has been absolutely incredible. He's sweet and caring, though not a romantic by any stretch (which is alright, though I do admittedly miss it), the sex is frequent and amazing, and he understands me on a level that wasn't possible with 25M. He's admitted he loves me and I feel the same way towards him. We've even met each other's families.

However, there's still a weird sense of missing 25M. Only the good times, admittedly, but he's admitted he's still very in love and wants me to come back. Part of me still feels like he's my soulmate and he says I'm the only person who understands him, and he's so closed off and mean I might be the only person who ever will. I feel like I abandoned someone I promised to love forever.


I'm in love, and happier a lot of the time. But I wonder if I did something terrible in leaving 25M. What do I do? Can I get over this?",relationship_advice

username#00520,post,2019-09-14 00:25:11,I (23F) Am Thinking About Leaving My Fiance (25M) For A Close Friend (31M),"I know this sounds fucking awful right off of the bat. I feel like a piece of shit. My fiance and I have been together 4.5 years (on and off) since I was 18. 


We're best friends. When things are good, they're fucking amazing. He finally proposed after 4 and a half years. But that's when things are good. My fiance and I both have different forms of bipolar disorder. Mine is much more internal and mood swings last hours/days, while his is external and lasts weeks/months. All of the ""off"" periods were his idea, and so he could have sex and/or relationships with other women. His ex, a friend, and a few random girls. He would hide each time until after we got back together, and I'd feel in too deep. He'd insult me and tell me I ruined his happiness with whatever girl, call me fat (I'm petite, but am careful about my weight), etc. Then in a month or so it'd go back to being great. We'd go months without so much as a spat. Then he'd have another mood swing, jerk off constantly and stop having sex with me due to his porn habits/masturbating (and leave evidence laying around and occasionally verbally shove it in my face that he was masturbating but didn't want to have sex), tell me I ruined his life, and at one point told me he didn't really see me as a person. Then he'd go back to being a sweet, amazing boyfriend who took me on surprise dates and told me how beautiful I was and how much he loves me, and our sex life would be normal again. He flip-flopped between wanting to get married and hating the idea of marrying me several times (mostly citing he didn't find me attractive). He has been physically abusive once in his past with ex, and once hit me (not insanely hard) while tired, but it was more half-asleep and I forgave him, this was about 2 years ago. Hasn't been any bit violent since towards me.


He recently told me to cut off all of my friends. All for different reasons, over a period of a month. One was my very close friend (31M) who told me he had deep feelings for me. I won't lie, I've had feelings for this friend in the past. I've thought he was handsome for the entire friendship. He has never gotten mad at me for crying (something fiance will do) even when I sob, and has done nothing but be gentle and kind. He's a deep, beautiful soul. But I agreed, because, fiance comes first. Fiance continued to spiral downwards. I sought brief solace in occasionally texting 31M. Nothing serious, just wanting someone who understood me. He gladly obliged, even stating he understood I love fiance deeply and see myself marrying him. I will admit, feelings did start creeping back in. I missed him so much in that off period that I hadn't talked to him.

Fiance then nearly hit me over something stupid that wasn't my fault. He threw things, screamed, and accused me of having sex with 31M. I've never been so viscerally terrified of him. Since then, 31M and I have been talking more. I asked if I left, if he would have me. He said in a heartbeat. I realized I wanted that more than anything. We both promised we wouldn't cheat on fiance. Even when he's being an ass, he doesn't deserve that. And I can't help but think of the good times with fiance. And how I could be married and have a husband, and be the working wife I've always dreamed of being. But my feelings for 31M are so strong that it's really making me question what to do. He's even told me he thinks I should leave, partially because he cares about me and wants to give me a good life, but partially because he says I deserve a lot better than that. All of my friends agree that I should date 31M instead, because he clearly cares about me, and doesn't shy away from it.


I'm lost, Reddit. I want 31M and the life he wants for me, and I'm really, really considering it. He's an amazing man and has gone out of his way just to make me smile, and never lashed out at me in years of friendship. He compliments me and gives (platonic) affection that makes me feel safe. But I also don't want to break fiance's heart, and the idea of giving up a 4.5 year relationship, and the chance to be fiance's wife, hurts a lot. Fiance is a good, but mentally unhealthy guy. When he's in a good headspace, he's my hero and the husband I've always wanted. 

What do I even do?",relationship_advice

Lately I relapsed after quitting by myself, I have relapsed quite a lot, pretty much all the time, I always make it a few months then just relapse again. I relapsed a few days ago, and I think about getting more constantly, I know, I know, you'll just deny my ""addiction"" because it's not anything like meth. I have two addictions though, Codeine, Oxy and These drugs. I am more addicted mentally to Amphetamines though. 

I've thought about moving on to meth and heroin, but It's somewhat hard to get meth where I live. I still crave it months after I quit, heck, I've went so long WITHOUT cravings before and then I had a dream about it one day, got the cravings back, and relapsed shortly after. 

Should I tell someone, doctors, mental health workers? Someone? 

Another question I'd like to ask is, what's the treatment for this? 

The cravings are pretty, intense, so intense I always find someone to give me some on a daily basis, and boom, another relapse. I'm not sure if these are also physical withdrawal symptoms, I'll list them:
- Lethargy
- Depression
- Sore stomach, extremely painful
- Pain full joints, mostly legs
- Twitching of the head
- Restless legs, on and off the drug though
- Anxiety
- Extreme tiredness 
- Sometimes extreme hunger other times too sick to eat

Anyway, can anyone help me please? Thank you.

I feel like no one cares recently, I feel trapped in my own mind, I don't feel real... I feel so distant from myself that I can't even connect reality with non reality and I'm on fucking medication for that (Amisulpride). It was working WONDERS but why isn't it working anymore? Why? I'm not sure what to do if I go back to the way I was a few weeks ago, that was pure hell.

I have schizophrenia, so I worry quite a lot. I feel EXTREMELY empty and emotionless, I don't feel right, I don't feel human I suppose you can say. I don't want to come out of this psychotic episode and just jump right back into one, I don't want that. I want to be better, not worse.

I've been thinking lately about doing heroin more and more just to take these feelings away, instantly, but I know that's not how it works, I know that's not what will happen and I know that it wont be good in the long run, so that's why I haven't done it yet.

I'm always so drugged up that I'm extremely lethargic, I can't see things properly well, as much as I could before, everything is all blurry. I feel horrible, I wish I was sad more than nothing, I just, I wish I could feel an emotion again, and not just happiness which I hardly feel anymore anyway but I mean sadness too, I wish I could.

I'm an empty shell of nothingness, what's the point in me being here? Nothing, I do nothing to help nothing, It's nothing. I am nothing, I want to feel like something but, unfortunately I am NOTHING, whatsoever. 

I need some help, even some personal stories about something similar would be GREAT.

I've been an atheist for about 2-3 years  now, I never told my parents, just my close friends and SOME teachers that I knew wouldn't tell my parents.

I became an atheist primarily after I had my first ""psychotic break"", I was having delusions about religion etc. So when I came out of that I got rid of religion all together, not saying that was the only reason, just a good reason to not go back to religion.

I also stopped being religious because I saw how utterly idiotic in my mind it was and it was quite delusional, so here I am now, non religious. These aren't the only reasons of course just some of MANY. 

So yeah, enough of my rambling, how do I open up to my religious parents? My family is a really religious family, even their parents were extremely religious, It's just how they were brought up and I'm scared incase I break their ""tradition"".

I need some help, how do I explain to them I don't worship their god and I'm an atheist?

No one understands me, I try and tell them how I feel, how I think and how I see the world but they will never understand and that makes me feel so alone. I've always tried to fix other peoples problems when I need to put myself first, but I just can't do that. I just can't.

I've thought about suicide in the past before, but I don't want that to be the only way out, I am on Amisulpride and that's been working GREATLY, and hopefully it keeps doing it's job, I don't even feel like I'm in a psychosis any more or even schizophrenic.

It's quite annoying, sure, I've smoked it before, it was great, made me a little more paranoid due to my schizophrenia, but it was fun and I may do it again with him or my gf. But when you go on about how much you smoke it or how great it is or when I try and talk about another thing and you just keep going back to pot, that's annoying, doncha think? Anyway I may make a rant about that on a thread I post. But yeah, those in your face recreational drug users are annoying as fuck, and this friend of mine, is annoying as fuck when all he goes on about is how much weed he has, plus, he hardly ever shares it, what a douche, eh?

I think everyone has those, over the top stoner friends, that basically, just act like stoners, they aren't really, they're just self entitled recreational pot users that are in your face about pot, not stoners, they're completely different. Stoners are usually cool ass motherfuckers that smoke pot with you, or smoke it nearly all the time with their friends that are also stoners, but they also talk about other things, even when lighting up or smoking it. Those guys, are cool.

Anyway, I was just rambling about my experience with this particular individual.",offmychest

The scientists who created this island, this haven for the survivors were frowned upon. Most folk didn't believe them,  a flying island was just a myth. Just a story and a lost cause. Just a way to bring hope to a hopeless land. Many of them turned a blind eye and tried to live in the empty, ruined cities or farms but many soon, had learned it was near impossible too, and that they had to try this 'plan' for the benefit of their survival.

When it worked, many we amazed. It lifted so high and people rejoiced and praised these smart people. Life could go on, no longer shall we cry about the past when a future life before us. A future of hope.

But now, the hope was thinning and terror reeked among the people. The gentle breeze was now a roaring wind as our Paradise fell from the heavens and down to the deserted, ruined surface that was once our homes. Screams filled the streets as many begged the scientists for help, but had to avail.

The scientists, the gods who created this new future, once idolized, respected people now being shouted and blamed for our doomly demise. Now being treated worse than the dirt on the souls of our feet

Now the end is here, and we're going to die. There is no future, no hope, no god to keep us safe. We're going to die.",WritingPrompts

My most recent one I never really got to finishing but it was about a undercover assassin in a high school. of course I got the whole plot in my head but I haven't gotten to writing it down.

Another recent one was also for school and it was about deja vu and my friend who should not be named copied my whole story after I finished and handed it into the teacher and ended up failing and blaming me for the grade even though it was her fault.

basically my bf at the time went to it with a pair of tweezers and a small needle and basically opened both the bumps and squeezed all the pus and blood out. then he squeezed them shut and it hurt like fucking hell but it only took a week of cleaning it twice a day and not sleeping on it for it to heal up and stop hurting. 

now i'm not saying do this. if anything im saying avoid messing it with it as much as possible and make sure to clean it twice a day. if it continues to get worse definitely take it out. oh and switch to a simple steel don't do any extravagant jewelry until it's fully healed. which can take a few months - a year.

I do think men are treated more as drug seekers and women are treated more as.. well.. stupid and mentally ill. Military doctors have a hard time understanding that women actually have a brain that isn't only emotion. But men actually get care. If a man says he's feeling something, there's tests done. 

Also, they couldn't give you pain meds because you refused physical therapy, probably. Even if you were exercising, most doctors have a specific progression of treatment (especially with Tricare) that they have to follow or it won't be covered. 

And basically, long-term chronic pain patients can die, and acute (especially men) patients get treated well. It could very much be about your chronic condition, since anyone who's been to a doctor for the same reason more than once MUST be an addict /s.

The relationship is a two way street. I know my condition is difficult on others. I need to make a conscious effort sometimes as to not be a difficult arsehole by attending therapy and taking my meds. However make sure she is actually taking meds. We schizophrenics are horrendous at it and we do need help taking them sometimes. It will be hard but create boundaries and don't let her excuses overtake them or the relationship will become toxic. 

This condition is horribly stigmatized. In my opinion you two could have a wonderful life together.

So the problem here isn't that I haven't sought help.

He'll try to poke fun at me as a joke and I'll think that he's making fun of me and trying to hurt my feelings. He's very sarcastic and I talk everything he says literally. 

I can't get through a conversation with him without getting overwhelmed with fear and breaking down. I have no idea what to do.

You need to have a conversation with your wife about why she's feeling so insecure. Her getting that emotional from hearing you say that is not normal, but you cannot brush it off as her being over emotional. My guess is she's not upset that you said to your daughter, she's upset about something else in the relationship and that just made her think about it.

Either she's competing for your love with your daughter and needs to get therapy for it, or you're showing a lack of affection towards her and that sent her over the edge. Either way, PLEASE do not dismissive her feelings.",AmItheAsshole

You're girlfriend shouldn't be financially responsible for your decision to buy a home.

I think the issue here if your not charging ""rent"", your making her help pay off the house. If you were also renting, no big deal, it's the inclusion of the mortgage that I think makes this feel unfair to her. It sounds to me like she's been made financially responsible for a mortgage that she won't benefit from if you sell that house. 

Renting the house out was a good idea, I think treating your girlfriend like a renter rather than a partner is going to strain your relationship, especially since this feels like she's being financially taken advantage of.

I figured that if I made it to the top of this cliff side I might be able to see where my plane had landed. Amazingly, I had survived the jump out of it with only minor injury but my plane, and the survival pack inside of it had all landed somewhere on the other side of the island. 

I place both my hands on the top of the cliff and grunt as I struggle to lift myself onto the plateau. Apparently rock climbing immediately after jumping out of a plane wasn't a good idea. 

Rolling onto my back, I stare up at the sky and attempt to catch my breathe, but it's knocked out of me again when I turn my gaze to the beach shore. Piles of trash as far as the eye can see litter the shore. Although the sight made me extremely worried for the earth and the state of the environment, it also filled me with hope as something useful could easily be hidden in the mounds of junk that lay on the beach.

I roll onto my stomach and quickly descend down the cliff side towards the beach shore, dreaming of all the tools I could fine in the rubbish. Once at an appropriate height, I leap down onto the ground and race to the beach to begin my search. I dig through the first pile I reach and am immediately greeted with a small tamagotchi toy.

""That's weird"" I laugh as I hold up the toy, ""I had one just like this in elementary school"". The trend continues as I dig further into the pile. Toys I had left on playgrounds, jackets I had left at school, and even headphones I had forgotten on bus seats comprised the pile of trash in front of me. It was through this observation that I discover the piles were all made up of things that I had lost at some point in my life.

I spend the rest of the day reliving childhood memories and reuniting with items I thought I would never see again. I start on one end of the beach and make my way to the other throughout the day, placing items I think are important, or things I just like into a backpack I had left on an airplane when I was 13.

The sun was just setting as I finally make my way to the final heap when the shape of another human figure caught my eye. They stood a little ways away from the pile, their back turned to me. I feel my heart leap at the sight as it meant I wouldn't be alone on this island after all. 

""Hey!"" I call out to them, but they continue to face away from me. ""HEY!"" I yell louder this time and being to run towards them. Their head perks up this time, a signal that they've heard, and they turns their body to face me.

Since sophomore year of high school I've wanted to major in Musical Theatre (BFA) and I spend three years of high school preparing for college auditions with acting and singing lessons. Senior year of high school I auditioned for about 8 programs and got into 1 (CCPA) which I had to decline due to it being too expensive. 

So I ended up gong to the school I am at now because of 1.) money and 2.) the let people who didn't get into the BFA re-audition halfway through the school year. So I was feeling pretty confident about re-auditioning, and spent first semester taking dance, singing, and acting lessons to prepare for it. So the audition comes, I don't get in, but neither does anyone else who re-auditioned and it turns out the school never planned on letting anyone into the program in the first place. This pissed me off because when I auditioned they didn't judge me on how good I was but rather knew the answer was no from the moment I walked in.

So the next few months were hell. I had come to this school with the goal of being a musical theatre BFA and now there was no way that was going to happen, and if it did happen I would being going to school for 5 or 6 years which is something I did not want to do. I spent the next few months incredibly depressed and feeling like I didn't have a future anymore. 

So during this time I started watching a bunch of movies and reading a bunch of book which are both things I already did a lot of anyway but this time I was like ""oh hey, I really like these things. Maybe I like them even more than theatre"". I had always liked writing and I used to write a lot (I'm talking like one short story a day) and I stopped so I could focus on theatre and I was like, maybe I should do that again?

So at this point in time I've changed my major to creative writing with an emphasis in screenplays. Theatre is now my minor and since I only took theatre classes this year, it's completed and I can add another minor. I'm hoping to add Japanese so I can teach english in Japan after college, or add a film minor so I can have a better understanding of film. Best case scenario, I add both.

So obviously, things aren't doing in the direction I spent most of my life dreaming they would, but I'm still very happy with this decision. Going to school for theatre hurt my passion for it, I'm not really sure why but I don't love it as much as I used to. Going to school did however help me realize that theatre isn't exclusively what I love, it's storytelling in general which can include all sorts of different art forms I'm interested in exploring.",AskReddit
username#00554,comment,2016-12-05 17:54:15,,"Honestly I don't think Suicide Squad provided us with enough of him to make a fair judgment on the character or his performance. 

The Joker wasn't a very relevant character in that movie, and honestly you can cut out most of the scenes he was in, or even his side plot all together and have the movie be fine. It really felt like they put that character in to draw in an audience without actually figuring out what they wanted to do with him. His only purpose in the movie was to be a love interest for Harley, and the movie set up and established their relationship with one another more than it established who The Joker was as a character. 
The script never gave him the opportunity to show us who he was or what his role in Gotham was which really sucks because Jared Leto seemed to have a lot of good ideas about the character when you watch him talk about the character in interviews before the movie came out.
With that said I still thought the character was pretty interesting. It's not the same Joker as The Dark Knight, but I don't think that's a bad thing. Heath Ledger's Joker wouldn't work in the universe DC is establishing, but Jared's does. I just wish he was in a movie that allowed us to see what he's about and what he can do so people can make a more informed judgment on him.",movies

What do I do now?,"My boyfriend got upset today because I told him he needs to get his groceries from the food bank. It's because I'm all out of money. I've spent my whole paycheck on food for him and I. I've been supporting him for a month. He got fired from his job because he took too many days off which I warned him about. He still hasn't found a job after a month and is lazy during the day about job searching. I suggest over 100 of places he can apply to, tell him about work agencies, tell him to donate plasma. I have to always buy his food because his family won't give him any money. He always got angry at me suggesting because he called me bossing him around. He also wants to play on his Xbox all day and night. I tried taking it away but he got his mom involved and she screamed at me over it and told me I can't treat him like a 2 year old. I was just trying to help him. I loved him so much I never wanted him to suffer. I told him I can't afford any more food and we got in a heated fight about how I'm always buying everything and he's selfish for getting angry at me for suggesting the food bank and he's not entitled to my food or money. I've been paying the rent, the utilities, the wifi, the food, the pet stuff, the house necessities. And driving him everywhere because he doesn't have a license. During our fight he grabbed me by the arms. I was screaming, ow and get off me. He dragged me to the couch and I slipped down and he grabbed me in a chokehold and dragged me to the bedroom. Opened the door picked me up and threw me into the bedroom and told me to think about it. I got his keys and kicked him out. I called the police but they didn't arrest him. I took an ambulance to the hospital because I fell into my stomach when he shoved me to the ground and I'm 3 months pregnant. I'm so sad. I'm so broken. My baby is okay I think, but I left the hospital because I was waiting for hours. I still got an ultra sound though. I'm just so fucking sad. ",relationship_advice

username#00556,post,2022-07-01 17:20:29,Losing touch with reality? What's happening to me,"Over the last few weeks I've been feeling very different. I've been feeling like life isn't real/a dream, I've been hearing bangs or sounds around my empty house, and seeing small things like flashes of lights, shadows, faces. I thought I saw a severed hand on the side of the road while driving but I kept driving. I also saw random animals like ducklings and kittens which I'm not sure if they are real now that I think about it since I don't know whyd they be around where I live. I also see still things move sometimes but I always double take and it seems okay again. 
At first I didn't think much of it but it's been happening daily now so I am getting a little concerned. 
I should also mention I feel like there are a couple delusions I think like I'm being stalked, or the car next to mine is going to kidnap me, that we are living in the backrooms reality, and that I can/deserve to be a celebrity and that I can be like Kira from Deathnote (lol one of my fave shows)
But obviously I can still think rationally and think what it's not true. 
The only time I feel normal and don't experience this is when I'm with my boyfriend or at work. I still will see the things I mentioned before but I feel normal is what I mean. 
Is this maybe a sign of something bad happening? Do you think it has anything to do with being alone or tired? I do take zoloft for depression for the last two years but it's never been a problem",Advice

username#00556,comment,2023-04-17 22:18:10,,"YTA- I used to work at Victoria's Secret, and it's more than just a ""women's underwear store"". There's bras, lingerie, perfumes , soaps, clothing, shoes, blankets, robes, purses, makeup, and more. It's a great place to find a gift for a women in your life and I'd recommend it to people because I genuinely like their product (I definitely did not enjoy working there though). I remember soooo many men would wait outside for their GF or wife and look like a pack of waiting pigeons. It was sooo funny. Though I agree you shouldn't go in a store that makes you uncomfortable, if you went in you'd see there is actually nothing uncomfortable about it- you could've been more open to the idea rather than assuming it's just a underwear store. Maybe they'd have something you'd like too? Maybe you and your girlfriend could have bonded over something? And I don't see what's wrong with embracing undergarments either. They are a part of daily clothing, not a sex toy. Your girlfriend wanted to spend time with you. And I think it's simply cringe a grown man won't go into a store because he thinks it's a sexual store when it's not. Also you'd make nobody uncomfortable. Men and women are welcome into the store. The employees would appreciate you being a good boyfriend and spending time with your girl. If you can't go into a store because they sell wOmEnS uNdErWeAr, you shouldn't go into stores like target, Walmart, and Walgreens either. 
I feel like most comments are assuming the girlfriend wanted to have some kind of flirty moment with her boyfriend. Though this can be the case, I disagree. I feel like she wanted to go in just like any other store, and found it offensive you find the store too uncomfortable to go into when it's something your girlfriend needs to wear on the daily (bras and underwear). It's like saying you don't want to be understanding of something she needs to use daily because it's an uncomfortable topic to you, rather than you just being more open to learning about the subject.",AmItheAsshole

I remind him every time he visits to not use my shampoos and conditioners because they're very expensive and for damaged hair and I don't want him wasting it. That way he understands and remembers not to even use it. I don't think it hurts to warn someone.

username#00565,post,2022-05-16 12:22:49,My dad wants to get my dog pregnant and sell the puppies when I don't want her to,"So for context, I have a Jack Russell named Tina who mates with another Jack Russell named Max when she's in heat (they've only tried this once a couple of months back) and a couple of weeks ago I took my dog and myself (a 15f) to go and live with my mum as my dad was emotionally abusive to me and physically abusing/semi emotionally abusive to my dog (by hitting her on the head hard when she's in trouble to the point she sometimes yelps while he screams at her so now she flinches whenever you put her hand near the top of her head, shoving her toilet training pads/tissues down her throat to the point she gags if she rips them up while once again yelling at her, etc).

Anyways onto the story so basically after a text convo where he basically taunts me saying that i have my phone number (which is now apparently his phone number) onto my bank account i got a message where he basically said that Max's owner wants to try and mate Max and Tina together the moment Tina is on heat again so he can sells the puppies when they get to 6 months old (he's told me this before where basically we give Max's owner a puppy and he gets the rest so he can sell them) and since i don't have her number i asked for him to send it over so i can contact her myself about it as Tina is currently in my possession however he replies saying that she will have to 'come home' when she's ready to be mated up and begin talking about a deal (keep in mind never had a deal to begin with as he said that I could 'take the damn dog' so i told him that no that wasn't ok and there wasn't any deal to begin with and he's replied saying that Tina's not allowed to come home and how I'm basically causing a drama and I haven't replied after that. To be honest, I really don't know what to do as the dog could possibly be in his name and if he got the puppies I wouldn't be surprised if he abused them also, so any advice would be greatly appreciated from me as I'm genuinely shocked and I'm concerned if he's going to break in and steal her or something as he has threatened to break into my mum's house/nearly has broke down the door a couple of times a while ago.",Advice
username#00565,post,2022-05-06 04:56:46,My dad has been emotionally abusing me and I want to stay at my mums but my dad is possibly manipulating me and I don't know what to do,"So basically for context I have been told by my friends, my therapist and doctor that my dad has been emotionally abusing me (I'm a 15F with diagnosed schizophrenia and depression and have pretty severe anxiety/imposter syndrome because of it and my dad being very private (this causes me to have not very good social skills, makes it semi-hard to communicate to people in real life and sort of breakdown or cry or basically have a panic attack when conversations don't my way due to me planning out the conversations beforehand), my mum and dad don't talk to each other and if they want to say something to the other I'm the one who usually has to do that if that's important btw and my dog is basically kinda like a therapy dog for me (she isn't an actual therapy dog tho), but she got me through some really rough times in my life) but anyways my doctor suggested that i tell my dad that hes been emotionally abusing me and suggested that i should move to mums so thats what i told him and he got confused and asked me how does he emotionally abuse me and when did he do that and i told him and he ended up telling me that i basically used him as a scapegoat to change meds (my meds aren't really working), how my mum is worse because she works longer etc but then after when we were at home, he said that i can go to my mums coz thats what the doctor suggested and then i started breaking down (because I was under the assumption that he was going to keep the dog) and I asked him what about the dog and he said take the dog with you, i can get another one it's not like women have left me before and now idk if i should go or not so what do I do?

If it's important, I can also add what he's done to emotionally abuse me/stories which have been called abusive/given me trauma in the comments but at this point I don't know what to do, he's also in the past threaten to report me missing/call the police/break into my mum's house if I left but I don't know if he's still going to go through with that.

username#00565,comment,2023-11-30 04:45:38,,"I love my parrot, who was originally a wild parrot but he got abandoned by his mother so I decided to bring him in and he grew attached to me, he's pretty chill and loyal + we give each other little nicknames lol, I wouldn't get another one however unless its to make him less lonely if I need to go out (he's terrified of female galahs though and getting male one is a bad idea because he'll try fighting him and I don't want my special little guy to get hurt so that's why I haven't gotten another one yet) but one downside to mine at least is that keeps stealing my food and running around triumphantly and doing a victory squeal when he's successful. Seriously though, they require a lot of effort and time but in the end if you do that, they'll bond to you they'll be your friend and best buddy for life. 

Just if you get a parrot be prepared for them to screech very loudly to get your attention, force you to share your food, break out of their cage (I keep him in his cage at night because in his eyes that's his safe space) to watch over you while creepily saying your name at 3am and stomping around you to use vibrations to try and wake you up at soon as the sun rises or just bite your nose to wake confirm if you have died in your sleep or not (that second last one might just be my parrot because he thinks it's funny). 

Also in Australia at least for galahs specifically (I'm not sure with other birds like 28s are also included in this as I only really do research on galahs so I can be the best owner I can be to him) he does have a better/safer life as a pet than the wild galahs as because of the sheer amount of galahs causing them to be considered pests by the government, people who are farmers or work in something similar are allowed to shoot them if they see them near their farms. I understand the reason for this especially for people who are growing sunflowers because that's like hardcore drugs for them just from how they act, I'm just saying that because galahs are considered pests here, it's much better/safer for my special little guy to live as a pet than in the wild. However I do understand the other point of this argument but from my opinion at least if the bird is considered a pest by law and allowed to be shot on sight, then its probably better to let him stay with you as a pet then let him leave and possibly die from bleeding out because he wanted to have something to eat but that's just my opinion didn't mean to go on a rant lol also I am not saying to kidnap galahs to take as pets, I'm just saying that for some species at least in Australia, being taken as pets is sometimes the better option than out in the wild.",AskReddit

My bird broke all of our dining room chairs which was around $800 we had to throw out besides one which was semi-usable (we couldn't force him off otherwise he would of tried biting us which would be an extra $100 for a hospital visit and a lot of pain). My dog on the other hand ran head first into our laminated glass door which is still in the process of being fixed but right now will be costing a minimum of $1000 to get cut & fitted. She was completely fine however but ironically enough the second most expensive thing she broke was herself when she vomited 17 times out of stress when she was going to the vet and getting her teeth cleaned costing us a $900 hospital visit instead of $300 lol.,AskReddit
username#00565,comment,2023-11-30 04:01:05,,"My dog suffers from yearly phantom pregnancies and my family (I didn't get to make the decision as I was too young at the time) decided not to get her neutered (we can't now because of her age being too much of risk). However because of that she goes through hell thinking that pregnant as her milk being rotting inside of her until she believes that she's miscarried and becomes depressed over her non-existent dead puppies every single year. The nurses also can't do anything about it where I'm from besides neutering her unless they decided to give her steroids (its illegal for vets to do that for phantom pregnancies where I am currently however my dad who was a greyhound trainer and had some unused ones, used to do that for her phantom pregnancies and her allergies). 

I'm just saying this from my pov from a dog that has these that would be an ethical reason as deciding to not neuter her when she was young is doing more harm than good and unless I want to risk her life I can't do anything about it. I also can't get her pregnant to stop it happening for one year because it's both a risk to the male dog and her (she's aggressive to other dogs because she was scared by a Rottweiler and a few greyhounds when she was young and they were her first interaction as her mother died after she was born as she was separated from her two other siblings at a young age and because of her age there's a higher chance of complications and I don't want to risk her health further). 

Sorry if this is kind of dark I just wanted to get my point across clearly that sometimes it is better to neuter them than leave them un-neutered for reasons like this and also as a warning for people who have dogs who suffer from the same things.

The school i went to was insane. We had ""religion"" class that we did homework and tests for legit grades in. Religion in quotations because it was only the catholic religion, i bet they feared if they taught us about other religions we wouldnt be catholic. I honestly didn't mind while going there because i legit didn't know about other religions, i knew about Judaism but i truly thought it was no longer because of the way i was taught. They never implied or outright said it, i was a kid and the lack of knowledge of JUDAISM (the fucking religion that JESUS FOLLOWED) from my religion teacher just made me believe it stopped after jesus invented christianity.

I never believed the bible to be true, i didnt know they wanted me to think that. I thought the people could have been real, and that the book was just a story to help learn life lessons and how to be a good person. 

This whole thing made me feel so alienated as a kid, i would pray for things to happen and i didnt hear God talk back to me, nor the things happened. Some of them were vain. Ngl. But they didnt even tell me that God doesnt actually TALK to you, hes supposed to show signs or whatever. Anyways i felt like i was the only one that God didnt speak to and weird that i didnt truly believe in miracles. I was also treated badly by teachers at the school indirectly for being adopted.

Oh yeah, I have a brother (turning 20 in october). He doesn't wanna do anything with my father most of the time. Where as me (24) or my sister (22) would happily tag along with certain things my father want's to do. You can definately find something to bond over, we all bond while watching a show/movie we all find interesting (this is my example, may not be the same case for you). My brother would be happy to do some stuff with my dad, but right now hes in college culture and like to hang out with his friends all day rather than my father.

 It seems you don't really care to understand what your daughters' hobbies or interests just because you don't like that. So? Being a father is to show support and maybe ubderstand why they like it so much. It really feels to me like you do not even want to try to bond. 

Maybe i have to mention this to you again, but make some friends. YATAH.",AmItheAsshole

you're only letting your father to see his grandson because you needed a baby sitter? Thats really fucked up and sad, also telling that youre not willing to spend the money on an actual babysitter, not that your dad was a bad one in the first place but youre basically just using your dad, i think he should get paid if youre only using him to babysit. This is not some special gift you're letting your son and father have. I really don't care if he is well off without the babysitting money, its the fact that you are using him as one to avoid paying a real babyistter. Do you ever invite your father over just to eat dinner and hang out with the family?

To point 2:
Why are you making excuses for yourself? Isn't puberty supposed to happen while at middle school??? Im not really understanding why you think someone who taught middle school is an indicator that he doesn't know shit abt someone your son's age. Hell, he parented you, you're going to write it off because he was a middle school teacher? You're writing off everything he did to raise you and siblings if you had any. I guess his fallacy is that he raised someone who ended up treating him like a babysitter.

To point 3:
Perfect excuse!

To point 4:
Yup, you are 100% correct, you dad should be greatful for making your son feel in such a way that he wanted to throw a deodorant thing at him. Your son should be allowed to express his violence, it will really help him with relationships in the future.",AmItheAsshole

I understand that it is frustrating when someone related to you, that you know and love, doesn't remember what was special and attached to you as a person, but this is about just seeing them even if they remember jack shit about you and probably wont remember the visit, it shows how much they have meant to you. I would agree its very hard to see someone decline like this, but as a person who has experienced some form of dementia for almost a year of my life, its definately worse for the person who has it.

(Summary of what happened to me, i was forced to stop weed cold turkey. Idk if my diagnosis had a play in it, it 99% probably did, but i have schizophrenia. I almost rapidly started to decline into word for word what dementia/alzheimer's was. My reaction to cold turkied weed use was a fringe case, i would try to find answers constantly but i could find nothing of why this was happening to me)

Its not fun. I hated not being able to process what people are saying, I hated that my ability to think was practically gone except for ""why cant i think, where did my thoughts go"", i hated that my personality and emotions were non-existant. I couldnt watch videos to pass the time because i would immidiately forget stuff that was said or i was overthinking about not thinking and to tell myself to pay attention which did the opposite, so i sat in bed. No music, no activity, no videos, nothing, i just lay in bed and check the time until it was 8pm so i coukd go to sleep. I was in a deep depression because of this. I couldnt talk to my friends or even text because i had nothint to say, all i woukd talk about was how miserable i was and talk about how upset i was that i dide this to myself and that i'll be like this forever, mourning the life that was taken away from me so quickly.

Now i have completely recovered from all of this, it lasted since july 4th 2022 to feb/march 2023, so its almost been a year since,i honestly didnt think i would achieve being normal ever again but this did some real trauma to me.

I think its more frustrating to the people who struggle with dementia/alzhiemer's diseases, even if he seems way far gone. The only real thing you can do is be there for him.",TikTokCringe

I get how he thinks hard work can make someone into a better person in some sort of way, but the money he'a offering is like what he wouldve been paid as a kid. He doesnt understand how expensive shit is. 

Thinking that 1k will last his daughter 4 years of college is INSANE.
Wife is the actually smart one in this, they arent even poor like OP was in the past, why try and deprive your own child of the money she needs to nagivate this expensive world? She will learn how to budget on her own, and have it nothing to do about being a dollar to broke.

My ex's (20M at tjhe time) father (probably as old as OP) did the same thing. He wouldnt help him finacially, he just said to firgure it out on his own to his son. My ex (@23) lost his job ~7 months ago for a while, and really couldn't make any ends meet causing his MDD to spiral so horribly that his parents were telling him to go to therapy.... therapy? REALLY NOW? You think he has money for that when he has no income? His dad had convinced his mom not to give a shit anymore and they wonder why he won't visit them.

Edit: 1) I don't know much about the economy, but it's obvious that inflation isn't just the only thing.
2) edited mispelling and some grammatical errors

Edit: 3) my dad grew up poor, to where his siblings and he needed to eat competetively at meals. They ate liver even though they hated it so much, it was cheap, they learned to just dowse it in maple syrup so it was edible to them. My dad didnt have a soul sucking job as ones today, over his years a middle-late teen to gradiating highshool he would mow his neighbors' lawns, I think he was a paper boy but for a short time, and he was a bagger at a grocery store, he could buy himself things and also buy himself his own car with no one else in his family pitching in.

But with me, i struggle to even uphold an apartment with a roomate (since i can't even afford to live in one on my own), I still live with my parents. Employees around what my dad has done for jobs in the past are simply not making enough money to have this shit possible.

 Minimum wage, housing/renting is going waaay up, spending money on multiple medications I need to stay ""functional"" in a working enviroment, therapist and psychiatrist appointments, basic needs, the fact that I probably need to have two jobs to make this work out somehow (draining my life energy). What the average American makes at a job like mine, isnt going to do shit for them. Minimum wage should be a at a price where you can LIVE with some roomates or pay for other nessecities.

""You're a fringe case and wether or not people have a disposition to having schizophrenia or not can be seen at birth."" 

Yeah, I know and the risk is that no one would know,. No one knew i had it counting me, this is the same with people who has it dormat that no one knows until it presents around 16 - mid twenties (average).

 What i'm getting at is that we shouldnt be treated like weed is good for everyone and that it does 0 harm. Maybe someone who got suggested to try weed to calm themselves down and rid anxiety may start using multiple times a day just to be in that state becaude ehen they feel anxious, they know the weed will help.
Just because you smoke responsibly doesn't mean thats how everyone smokes. 

 Smoking weed is just as bad in respects to lung health as cigarettes. Memory and cognitive function (for some) just get flushed dpwn the drain. You can look that up, and you can probably find more things it can cause. Even if the chance of it happening is a small percentage, it will still effect people out there, maybe not you, but I dont know what you mean by 0 harm.

Weed harmed me, it traumatized me to were if i forget what something is called i feel l like will never get better and it will come back. (Just an example, i have have many more triggers for this) 

Im not saying smoking weed is bad, im saying we need to be more educated and careful talking about these things. I honestly did not start weed because of my will, i started bc the internet was making it sound like a cool thing to do. I would read about people texting really funny stuff to someone whilse high (as posts on media), seeing how it was something that was okay for everyone.

It hurt me, and if my experience and trauma means nothing, you are ignoring everyone else.

You are ignoring my friend and everyone else struggling with being addicted to weed. I do acknowledge that being addicted to hard drugs is far worse than someone addicted to weed. Im watching my friend deteriorate.

It would be nice if you gave a shit about other people.",facepalm
username#00569,comment,2023-05-23 17:33:12,,"Not always. People need to be very careful with weed. People who do have schizophrenia, but it is dormat in their brains and maybe will never present in their lifetime, weed or any other drug can trigger it to activate. It seems like it's not common knowledge and thats really scary.

Having schizophrenia myself, i feel terrible for these people who never know it was possible to now be living with such a stigmatized illness that will now alter their whole path in life. I never want anyone to get schizophrenia.

When i did start using weed to self medicate, it really helped in the first month, i felt like all my symptoms i struggled with were gone. As i started smoking every day (i think it did two times sometimes) i felt worse and worse, it then exaggerated all of the symptoms that i struggled with. 
I finally told my therapist after hiding it, if i truly wanted help i would have to tell the truth. He called my parents and made me quit cold turkey.
I've looked up how long the withdrawal symtptims would last around 2 to 6bwks i think?

 I did not crave weed during the ""withdrawal"" i was a total zombie, and it became so much worse than i was prepared for. I could get up out of bed, i just lay in bed, waiting until nightfell and checking the time on my phone. I couldbt distract myself with a game or anythijg Its like i had negative interest in things. I could not watch videos or interact with people i couldnt make each word they said into a string of coheasive information. I would have no idea what they said at all, and i couldnt respond with anything. I didnt know what was going on. I would cry thinking that this was how my life was going to be forever. My progress wasnt visible to the naked eye, i did not feel improvement. The worst of this lasted for 5 months in 2022 and right now i am still recovering from all of this.

This has never happened before and I've used many earbuds. Whenever I search for it I only get results for one earbud being louder but they're the same volume. Only the pitch is different.

username#00571,post,2019-04-24 18:57:24,AITA for making my ex threaten legal action?,"Last month my now ex-boyfriend broke up with me out of the blue. I was, understandably, kind of upset, but we both made it clear during the relationship that if it didn't work out we'd still want to be friends. Well right before we said our goodbyes he said we could still be friends but to wait a week before messaging him again. 

Flash forward to just over a week later and I messaged him back on Telegram saying if he still wanted to take a break it was okay with no response. I waited a few days before sending another message thinking maybe he didn't get it. A couple days later I ask him if he can please let me know if he wants a longer break so I'm not in the dark about it. He really ticked me off after this one because I made it a clear question and the app notified me that he read the messages but yet he didn't respond. 

At this point I wait another whole week and ask if he's ready and nothing. He didn't even read the message this time. Another week goes by and I think to myself ""maybe he deleted Telegram?"" I then send him a regular text message. Looking back it seemed kinda snarky but it read ""Maybe you'll answer if I text you here instead?"" At this point he finally responded telling me I needed to stop. (Just a reminder that this is over 3 weeks after he sent his last message.) I informed him that I just wanted to be friends because at this point I was genuinely worried about him. He told me he couldn't be friends with me with no clear reason but I apologized anyway. Immediately after telling him I'm sorry he says ""That's it I'm done with this try and contact me and I'll file a police report and you can talk to them. Bye"" and that's the last message either of us sent to each other. 

So AITA for pushing him to this point?

Edit: Just to clarify I have no intentions on talking to him again after this. I realize I should've moved on sooner but I'm done with him now.",AmItheAsshole

I agree with all of that, especially the quote above, even though the actors are performing ordinary sex acts, the plot/story is usually taboo, turning normal sex acts into hardcore kink; acts involving family members; ""18yo"" boys/girls blackmailed into sex; authority figures forcing someone into sex, etc. Just general taboo stuff, making regular sex into hardcore kink.

There's a huge market for that stuff. Personally I like a story, growing up i was first introduced to porn in erotic comics so to me the story is very important, it turns the repetitive and mundane into new and exciting.

The old-school pornographers knew this, they would make full-length movies with entire plots and dialogue and then they'd sparingly sprinkle in erotic scenes here and there, all seemingly designed to leave you wanting more, watching those movies you'd sometimes forget you were even watching porn.

The porn I watch is mainstream too though (team skeet, nubiles, adult time), admittedly it might lean towards the kinky end of the mainstream spectrum, sure, which is probably why chocking and slapping, I guess :(

I decided to go into settings and mute the effects audio which made the sound go away (and only the effects slider, so it must be an effect of some kind), but I'd still like to know if anyone has a clue as to what the fuck it could be.

Could it be any of my armor/weapons or enchantments? [This is currently everything in my inventory.]( As for Misc, I just have a bunch of ores, soul gems (none empty), gems, heart stones. The usual things that as far as I can remember, haven't caused any noise previously. I have no mods installed. 

I also recorded the noise, although the video is jumpy because I had no clue if it was recording yet or if it was just messing with my screen for no reason, and apparently the hotkey for stopping/starting also loads a save in Skyrim, but the noise can be heard within 2 seconds of the video. [ Video is taken in Kolbjorn Barrow but the noise happens regardless of where I am.

I can't find any answers on google, since obviously that sound isn't Nirnroot, and googling ""ringing noise in skyrim"" brings up pages & pages of results of people finding out Nirnroot makes a noise for the first time.",skyrim
username#00579,post,2022-09-04 17:47:48,[TOMT][BAND] European Psychedelic Rock Band from late 90s/early 2000s,"This has been on my mind for the last 5 years. My searches have been not so successful in the slightest, as I dont have a lot to google off of.

I first heard this band 5 years ago, I had a tinder date who owned all of the bands CDs (iirc, there was only 3) and it would be the only thing he would listen to. He told me they were from some country in Europe, but all of the lyrics/song titles and band name were English despite the possibility of them being from a country with a different language. Also that they were active starting sometime in the 90s into the early 2000s, but they liked trying to make their songs sound older than they actually were. These are songs I've never heard once in my life before or after, so it's safe to assume they're not a very popular band (atleast in the US). I had the songs added on Spotify, but shortly after lost access to the account. I dont even remember anything about the band name, might've been 4 or 5 words long? But that's just another guess. Also I remember it being kinda nonsensical/untraditional band name that seems to be a trend amongst psychedelic rock bands. 

I gave up on my search for a while, but what reignited my search is probably the worst hint imaginable and has been driving me up the wall because this bands songs were so dang catchy and I just wanna listen again. I was watching a youtube video about internet mysteries when I heard [The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet]( and the memory of this band exploded back into my mind. Because of course it would with my luck. Im not saying they made that song, it would be foolish to ask a question no one knows the answer to, but the singer (dont remember his voice being *that* deep) and melody sounded similar. The sound of their songs was exactly like that song with a sprinkle of a bit more psychedelic elements.

And no, I cant ask the owner of these CDs the band name. He ended up ghosting me after 4 dates lol so his number is long gone from my phone, he never ended up sharing his socials, and I dont even remember his last name so that is a dead end of a lead. All I can do is hope someone here might have a guess. Even if it's not correct, it might help point my search in a better direction.",tipofmytongue

username#00579,post,2022-08-15 04:55:06,I'm the most productive I've ever been since starting night shift. I actually cook now!,"Most people claim night shift is terrible, people would even try to talk me out of switching over because they assumed I'd hate it. Even in night shift facebook groups it seems nightshift is generally disliked and seen as only a plus because theres usually a pay differential. I know im obviously not, but it feels like I'm the only one who genuinely prefers it lol. 

Day shift was brutal for me. I was constantly exhausted. I'd get up, go to work, and when I got home I didnt have the energy to do anything. I would be fighting to keep my eyes open all day, and by the time I got home it would be a losing battle. I lived off of lean cuisines, everyday I would zombie trudge to the microwave to heat up my daily meal. But at the same time, I would lay awake at night because my brain just wouldnt drift off to sleep. I needed heavy combination of sleeping pills just to get any form of sleep. I still take .5 mg of xanax to sleep because my tinnitus & brain just not shutting off keeps me up for hours if I dont, but it's *much* less heavy than what I used to take. 

I started working overnights in May and it has been life changing. I work 11 PM - 7:30 AM.

This is usually my schedule now (obviously it can vary but this is the basic outline):

- 8 AM: Arrive home. Make my husband a breakfast or salad wrap (he is a truck driver and works long days, he usually wakes up and goes directly to work so I make something he can quickly grab and eat). Refill my bunny's supply of hay. 

-9 AM: Go to bed

-11 AM: Husband leaves for work, since his alarm usually wakes me up too I get up to shower or whatever quick thing I have to do before going back to bed (like if I'm making chicken and vegetables, I'll marinate the defrosted chicken and put it back in the fridge. If I need groceries, I'll send a curbside pickup order) 

-3 or 4 PM: Wake up. Head to the grocery store to pick up the order. Pass time by watching TV or playing video games. 

-6 PM: Begin cooking dinner. Other housework that has to be done like change bunny's litter box if it needs to be, take out trash, fold laundry I didnt get to. 

-7 or 8 PM (depending on when I finish): Pass more time

-9 PM: Start getting ready for work, make my sandwich (even if I cook I bring a sandwich, my husband gets home atleast an hour after I leave and he has a big appetite since he doesn't have a chance to eat from being in a truck all day, if theres leftovers I bring them to work the next day), feed my bunnies their dinner salad. 

My biggest concern with the desire to start cooking was thinking of things to make everyday but I caught on quickly with coming up and keeping track of my ideas. I still deal with bad fatigue, honestly on my days off I usually sleep in until the time I usually cook dinner (besides getting up to change out the laundry, days off are laundry day) then go back for another nap around 4 AM. But I'm actually able to do things now, unlike when I worked days and did nothing else but work and fight to stay awake.",CasualConversation

I've had ones in the past, but just those mouth thermometers, but I'm even worse at those. I always have a temperature of 80 F, so I have a track record of being bad at these things. 

I bought a ""infrared forehead thermometer(model DET-306"", thinking it should be simple, 3 second results. I decided to see how it works, I hold it up to my head, 101 F is my temperature. I go back to the instructions to check if I did it right before freaking myself out, turns out I have to hold it an inch away from my forehead. Maybe I'm just bad at judging distances, but my temperature was different ranging from 97-99. Every. Single. Time.

I tried consulting google but this technology is just way over my head. Why can't I just simply press it against my forehead? How do these things work? What's the best way to use one (point at front of forehead, side of forehead)?

 I would cry everyday not wanting to go back to work. I've cried in front of customers, I've cried in front of my manager. Even as a cashier I was never able to go fast enough for their standards. 

I have chronic pain in my thighs, having to stand the entirety of a shift is just an 8 hour experience in hell (especially with the fluorescent lights most stores have, they'd mess with my head). Also because thanks to my health my body's so pathetic I have a hard time lifting things, I once had to carry a 20 lb turkey across the store because my manager didn't believe I'd struggle with that. Thank God the butcher saw me having a hard time with it and carried it rest of the way for me.  

I can work fast when it comes to what I do now, but not fast food fast. Used to be a sandwich/salad/wrap maker for Wendy's but making multiple meals (some meals including 10+ burgers) in 3 minutes was sadly outside my skill range. 

I'm shocked how people can have the ability to go back each and every day and put up with that bullshit. Managers look at you like raw meat, I once called to say I was going to the ER which was responded with ""do you **have** to do that now? Why would you ever have to do that now?"" 

I luckily found something I'm good at (medical billing) but to the people who are strong enough put up with this for more than a year without absolutely breaking, I congratulate you and y'all have one hell of a supporter of me.

username#00579,post,2019-05-10 00:21:11,Fast food/retail workers deserve to be paid just as much (or even more) than office workers,"So many people feel that fast food and retail jobs should stay minimum wage. I had both those kind of jobs when I was younger, now an office worker, and I will admit working at Wendy's and Kmart was much more difficult. I've had about 6 or so jobs in high school and I couldn't bare to work at any of them for over a month. Everyday I'd come back from work and just want to fucking die.

At Wendy's, I was a sandwich maker and expected to make all the salads, burgers, potatoes, etc for 2 different lines. When some jackass would order 10 baconaters it would cause a lot of impatient customers and a manager I could barely understand screaming in my fucking face. It's demeaning. They don't care for your well-being. I ended up having a breakdown and being hospitalized for a week. When calling my manager saying I was going to the ER, I got a ""can't that wait?"". 

I've had two office jobs so far. Both pay more. Both were way easier. Like ohhhhh, so hard to sit down all day. Soooo hard to be treated like a human being. Soooo difficult to not have to work at the pace of a speed-robot. Sooo tough to have a steady schedule and not one that spontaneously changes every week. 

I'm currently recovering from surgery, which I got total sympathy from my current manager saying to take my time and come back when I'm ready. Kmart, Wendy's, all the other retail jobs I've worked at wouldn't have tolerated any of that shit. It would be ""alright one day off but be back the next"" 

I feel like the fast-food workers and retail workers who have to be constantly on their feet, moving around all day, dealing with people who dehumanize them and still manage to go to work everyday definitely deserve more than I do.",unpopularopinion

It kinda kicked me hard into a shell. My social skills were already minimally developed, and this just stunted them more. I was always in workplace environments that were stuffy and uptight. I would just resort to having a no nonsense, boring, serious, flat affect. I wouldnt joke. Hardly smile (at most, a situation appropriate subtle & polite grin). I wouldnt chit chat or socialize with coworkers. It was a massive workplace culture shock when I started at my current job at a hospital. A small department (health info mgmt) where I'm still the youngest, but the environment is far removed from stuffy and uptight. I remember my first days I was so rigid, timid, and robotic due to what I was used to while my coworkers were a lot more relaxed & tbh, silly. Strange word to use, but it's true, we're a small bunch of weirdos. I also remember the first time I really broke my shell, laughing at something with my coworker, and she laughed even harder like ""I've never seen you laugh like that omg!!"", and then I ended up telling them the story of Mr. Hands which both horrified & amazed them as they still bring it up in passing like ""I cant believe that guy fucked a horse"".

When you change your speed, the lengths of the other sides change. When you move faster, the length of the speed side gets longer and the length of the time side gets shorter. However, because energy must be conserved at all times and the triangle must cover the same area, the mass side will also get longer. 

In a faster than light scenario, the length of the time side will equal 0 and you would end up with a line instead of a triangle. Well darn, lines don't have area, they have length. So I guess that doesn't work. Okay, well what happens as the time side approaches 0 instead? As you extend the speed side and shorten the time side infinitely small, the mass side needs to extend as well to conserve the triangles original area of 1.

username#00581,comment,2017-03-08 16:00:20,,"When math was formally ""discovered"" it was done by pattern recognition. The mathematician (Whoever it is) saw a recurring outcome by doing something specific. However, it did take thousands of years to invent calculus because sometimes these patterns are incredibly hard to see. However, after so many years, the human brain prevailed and thus calculus was born. We used knowledge of math that we have already to solve unanswered questions, and in turn used those answers to answer more unanswered questions. 

There is a problem though. The human brain -although quick as it is- is not nearly as fast as a computer. The circuitry of any device is between hundred of thousands to millions or times faster than we can unfortunately ever hope to be. The point is, if you had a self aware computer and you fed it some mathematical equations and told it to look for a pattern so it could quickly solve the problem given, it may only take seconds for it to derive a new formula for that specific problem.

The importance of creating AI is because it has the potential to be better than us at anything. Self driving cars have an incredibly low accident count. 

The beauty of creating AI is that we don't need to be able to be amazing at something to create a robot to do it better. I can't play chess to save my life, but given enough time, I could come up with some sort of algorithm for a computer to win 99% of the time.(Not actually but that's a popular example)

Here is the important reason to create AI:
If you can create an AI with roughly the intelligence of a human, and told it to go ahead and program another AI, it would do it better. Than all of a sudden you've got an AI better at making AI than you. So then the newest program writes another program that is even better than the last and the cycle continues. The AI will use the knowledge it already has to compute new answers to yet unsolved questions, implement what its found and repeat. 

This is an event called the Singularity. It is where computers become smarter than humans and solve every problem that has every existed or will exist; hypothetically. 

Ethics are called in to question here because our morals and laws apply to the human species. However, if a robot can exhibit all functions of a human, at a much higher capability, is it too a human?

I'm a bit off track, I do apologise. But the field of artificial intelligent design has an end goal in mind: to solve every problem ever. And thats why we keep making better and better ai. First time ever posting a comment on reddit, so go easy",explainlikeimfive

Half awake and unsure of the severity of the situation, I got my first cat into his crate immediately. My other cat, Chips, was a barn cat and feral when I first adopted him. I'm the only person he comes out for, he rarely peeks out when others are over. Taking him to the vet is a total struggle.
I had no idea how much time I had. I ripped open the closet where he sleeps and tore things out of it to find him. He flew up and out of the back corner; we had a good tussle before he escaped and ran off. 
I'm bleeding and running of out time. I turn my living room upside down to find him, but then I realize I have to take my other cat and hope for the best. 
Thankfully, it was a false alarm and kitty and I got back into my apartment swiftly. 
My arm is torn apart, there's blood on the walls, doors, my clothes, etc. I'm now covered in bruises and deep cuts. Chips is healthy and unharmed. 

I'm at a loss. If this was a real fire, I would have had to leave my BABY behind. I fell to my knees after I'd gotten outside with my other cat thinking I'd just abandoned my whole world.

I have recently adopted a 1 year old male kitty and I have a 3 year old male that's been with me pretty much all of his life.

Last night, we had our first introductions. Prior to this, we swapped bedding, fed on opposite side of the doors, allowed them to see each other through an ajar door (they booped noses)

However, new cat was very excited and exploring while resident cat sat on the couch looking nervous. Once resident cat jumped down to sniff new cat, new cat kept bounding up to resident to say hi. Resident hissed once and puffed up, but new cat didn't seem to understand, and kept coming towards him (tail in an upright 'happy' position).

Resident hissed again and I separated the two. I allowed new kitty to explore while resident sat on his perch watching. New kitty tried again, they booped noses, but new kitty got too close and resident hissed again and I decided that was enough for the night. 

I can tell new kitty is beyond ready to be out of the bathroom once and for all. He tries to dart out any chance he gets and meows when I close the door.

I recently adopted a one year old kitty and I have a three year old kitty that I've known his whole life. I got new kitty on Thursday. 

New kitty is thriving and ready to come out of the bathroom. I go in to play and cuddle with him, and he rubs against me, flops over and shows his belly, is exploring, and eating/drinking. 

Old kitty has always been VERY shy, but has begun to come near the door when I open it to check on new kitty. No hissing, no anger at all, just a curious look. Old kitty was nervous at first, but now has resumed rubbing against me and walking around the house with no issue.

I scent swapped yesterday with washcloths and they both sniffed them eagerly. 

Are there next steps before allowing new kitty out? New kitty has a vet appointment scheduled next Wednesday for his last set of shots, but tested negative for any diseases.

Do I wait until Wednesday to let him out, or do they sound fine to meet each other sooner? Should I keep old kitty in the bedroom while new kitty explores the living room as a next step?

username#00586,post,2022-09-01 03:31:57,When is it time for a new kitty?," My partner and I moved in together in early May with my kitty, Chips.

Chips was born a feral barn cat and we adopted him along with his brother, Fish, when they were just a few months old. While they're nervous and skittish around strangers, they're huge cuddle bugs around people they know well.

It was a difficult decision, but we decided to see if Chips could adjust on his own, since Fish would not do well in an apartment (he's an energetic kitty, more than typical cats, and likes to be outside with my sister). He's also bonded to my sister and mom more than me. If they didn't do well, Chips would go back home with my mom.

Chips ended up flourishing by himself! Because he's deeply bonded to me and more skittish than Fish, he really enjoys a quiet household where he can rule the roost his way. Fish got closer to my mom and the other cat in the house and has since adjusted. We often bring the kitties each other's toys to smell as well.

However, we've been wondering if Chips would be happier with another chill male cat to keep him company. I wonder if he's lonely without another kitty around? We play with him, there's a bird feeder in the deck for him to watch, we cuddle constantly, and he follows me everywhere I go.

Then again, I also worry that if it's too soon, Chips or the new cat may end up resenting the other and not acclimating well.

Well, today while getting Chips some wet cat food, we met a 11 month old male cat. He was born with other cats and rescued from a colony. He's known to be very relaxed, a huge cuddle bug, and very sweet. He seems like the perfect addition to our family.

However, I've been with my boyfriend for almost nine months now. Our honeymoon phase has smoothly blended with a feeling of comfort and security. 

Moral of the story: once you meet your person, you won't have to worry about the honeymoon phase ending. Continue to talk and engage, make up romantic and fun dates (simple as 'let's cook pizza together'), blend your lives and interests together. You got this!",relationships

I'm also 17, a senior and getting ready for college. I know how tiring it can be to do work, college applications/scholarships, chores, and personal stuff, then be expected to socialize afterwards. I have a younger brother that adores me and it seems like you do as well. He always wants to show me things, jump on board with my interests, and be included with what I do. 

Once I'm all done with my shit, I drink some water, have some food, rest, and then make time for him. That's all your brother wants. To be included and loved on by his big sibling. Even if you make plans for a once a week thing, that's at least something. It seems like he wasn't bothering you or being rude, he was trying to be nice, and you blew up wayyy too much. I'm sorry to say that this may stunt or ruin your relationship with him; he may not want to be around you much anymore or look up to you as much. 

Siblings are important, especially the younger looking up to older relationship. He needs you in his life, you better try to make amends before it's too late. 

You sound really, really exhausted. Maybe it's time to see a doctor? I used to get SUPER tired after doing pretty much nothing and it turns out I was anemic. Vitamin D and iron was the solution.",AmItheAsshole

I'm always going to advocate therapy with this kind of stuff. I was in it during those years and still am; it's a great way to work through these things. He's pretty young, but even then I'm sure a bit of therapy wouldn't hurt. Just to give him an outlet to vent, express his emotions, and also give him tools on how to proceed. 

The 'fine until right on the day of seeing M' sound exactly like my brother, who's 11. However, it's when we go see my dad. He seems fine, if not a little extra clingy, during the days leading up to see our dad, and then a switch flips. Sometimes it doesn't, but it's pretty common. He makes up excuses, or at best, makes sure he has a way to come home asap and nothing will prevent him from doing so. However, take this next part with a grain of salt, my dad was also emotionally abusive towards us during our parents separation. He would bad mouth our mom and manipulate and gaslight us towards disliking her as well. Pretty shitty stuff, and I'm not saying that's what M is doing, but its always good to get a new perspective. There's obviously something happening between your son and M (and maybe just on your son's end) that's causing your son to get anxiety about visiting him. 

He might even be having trouble transitioning from having M in his life all the time and as a father figure, and then only being able to see him, and not as your partner as well. There's a lot of reasons why this could be happening. 

There's a lot of emotions that come with separation, and my best advice is: be communicative, be there for him when he needs you, and therapy is always a great option. Good luck!",relationships

Even if it was something even more 'stupid' than this, it's still hurting and affecting you, so therefor, ta da, it's not stupid. It's how you feel. 

I wonder why exactly he wants this tattoo? Is it a celebrity, is it tied with something else (is it like a cowgirl, biker chick, etc), will this match other tattoos? Maybe he just saw a 'sexy girl' tattoo and went 'hey, neat, I want.'

Best advice I've heard about these kind of feelings: Worrying is like a rocking chair; it keeps you busy but gets you nowhere. 

Your partner is with you for a reason. He finds you attractive, he loves you, and he wants to be with you. Bluntly, if he wasn't, he'd be gone by now. 

Maybe you could do a simple matching tattoo with him, so he does have something about you on him? Even something as simple as each other's initials. Could totally be something you say like 'if we ever get married, i'd wanna get tattoos together' or something like that!

Work it out as a team, don't let it be a one-sided fight. 

My boyfriend is also sometimes insensitive and I've had to learn to roll with the punches, as I'm a very sensitive person. However, when someone he does or says hurts me, I'm honest with him about it. It prevents it from happening again and we're on the same page (you can easily build resentment for your partner by not communicating, because you're hurt and they're not a mind reader)

AND ALSO WHAT DID SHE SAY LMFAO. Okay, the way I see it:

1) She's saying that because she wants to do that to YOU and is encouraging you to work at getting better pecs and abs

or 

2) She's a fucking weirdo, not to be mean, but jfc I have a brother and I have never ever thought about grabbing his pecs what the actual fuck lmao

Again, be honest, be open, and let it be a mutual conversation. If it's one-sided, if she's defensive and aggressive, if she shuts you down and doesn't acknowledge your feelings, that's a huge red flag.",relationships
username#00586,comment,2020-10-24 03:39:46,,"Like I said, if you're hurting then you're hurt! Point blank! 

If my boyfriend said to me 'boobs are my favorite thing about a woman' and then said to me 'your ass is nice but my sister's boobs are better than yours' I would be so hurt! It's not the fact that she said it about her brother, it's that she purposefully brought this up in a way that degrades something you don't have. 

You need to talk to her, it's the only way to work this out and stop the hurt. Try ""What you said the other day about your brother has more defined abs than mine, right after saying that you like abs on a man the best, hurt my feelings. I wanted to talk this out with you to get to the bottom of it"" 

DO NOT give her an out (""Was this a joke?"" ""I might be overreacting"" etc) because then she may just play off that. I don't really know how to describe it, but don't add too much into it. Just say you want to communicate and talk it through, don't give her excuses to play on.",relationships

She made a point to tell you 'x is my favorite part of a guy' and then go on to say 'my brother has better x than you.' I find this to be really weird. Maybe she's trying to make you insecure, so you'll work on this more? Or maybe she was simply making conversation about lifting, like 'you're doing good at working on x, but my brother has been working on x.'

If you're blatantly threatened by her brother, that's an issue. If you're hurt by the fact that she said 'i like x about men but you don't have x' then that's understandable.",relationships

Before getting married, I want to go to couple's therapy with my partner to work out any underlying problems that could be an issue in the future. Talk with them about serious questions and stay 100% on the same page for our wants, goals, and dreams. 

I really want to get married. I think it's a sacred vow and bond between people that shows commitment and deep rooted love. There will be fights, there will be ups-and-downs, and the love may fade into soft embers instead of a fire over time, but I want my partner and I to always be healthy, happy, and in love, no matter what, and I want to choose a partner that is willing to make these changes and efforts to keep our marriage strong. 

I think a lot of people view marriage in the wrong ways. That it can fix problems, that it's a must if you have children involved, that you must do it if you're in love, etc. Marriage should be a mutual agreement with set plans and goals together and a mutual understanding that you're going to both CONTINUOUSLY work on your issues, communicate with each other, solve problems, be open, work at staying in love/committed to your partner, and be a team.

username#00586,comment,2020-10-13 00:49:34,,"I just want to add my two cents as a child who grew up with a verbally abusive father. 

My mother always had a soft spot for my father as well. I am 17 and my mother finally left when I was around 14. She stayed with him from her early teen years all the way until then. Years and years of mental and verbal abuse. That not only affected her, but me and my younger sibling. I have mental scars that will never fade, daddy issues, a constant fear of men, and ptsd from his yelling, manipulation, and gaslighting. 

My relationship with him now is strained. Even when he is in the best of bad moods, I am overcome with anxiety to the point of near-tears. This has also affected the way I view men and I have, and most likely will always, struggle in relationships. Not only because of my fear, distrust, and anger towards men, but also my perspective on how a man should act is completely skewed. 

Please, don't let rose colored glasses dictate your life. Not only for yourself, but the children you're raising. Make him get therapy or change himself for the better; this is a terrible situation to live in. 

I wish you well.",relationships

Honestly I feel like this can be solved with communication. A relationship is give-and-take, so talking through this could maybe help. Talking about the kissing (it's something you want, is it something she can do for you every now and then or is it something she doesn't want to do at all?) and then ask her what she does enjoy when it comes to being close. There are so many ways to show physical love language. This can be a conversation where you ask: 

1. How do you like to show or receive physical intimacy or romance?
2. Are there ways you don't like to be physical? And are there some ways that should be avoided completely? 

Aside from that, ways that you could be physical could be things like napping together, sitting on each other's laps, play wrestling, etc. It doesn't always have to be sexual. Just express your love through touch and you'll figure out together what your shared love language is. 

Good luck! :)",relationships

username#00586,comment,2020-10-06 05:31:49,,"Yo, we're kinda the same age so maybe I can give you some advice. 

You may be leaving the honeymoon stage with your gf, starting to fall into a routine with her. Things may not feel as alive as they used to and that can bring up some insecurities like 'am I losing feelings?' 

With communication, this stage can be turned into a comforting feeling. Like strong embers instead of a raging fire, if that makes sense. Breaks may work for some people, but it may bring up anxiety/insecurities for others. 

It might also be your depression. I know when I'm depressed everything in my life feels grey and dull; things, or even people, don't give me the same feeling they used to. I would suggest professional help, it's the best help in my opinion, and while it may be difficult or embarrassing, it's helped me and so many others out there. It may take time to find the right fit, but it's out there, trust me. 

However, when feelings fade, that might just mean they're gone. Don't let good looks or guilt (like knowing her family has helped you in the past) hold you back from feeling what you really feel. It'll just make things harder. Sometimes letting go and realizing 'hey maybe I'm not in love anymore, and this really can't be fixed or revered' can make you release a breath you didn't know you were holding in. 

I wish you well! <3",relationships

Many relationships, and people, are different and have different wants/needs. I know him well enough to know that when he wants to talk, he'll talk to me. I also know he's not the type of guy to want to talk every day. However, I feel like I'm not asking for much.

It's basically a difference in love language; while I might just say 'i love you' he might say 'stay safe.'

username#00586,comment,2020-08-18 00:57:37,,"I totally get this. Sometimes feelings of insecurity might taint the future and make it hard to make decisions, no matter how simple they may be. 

Nobody knows the future. You may break up tomorrow, in September, years from now, or maybe even never. 

I've dealt with these feelings/anxieties before, even in buying gifts like in your situation. I was spending a good bit of money on a partner of mine and I was suddenly anxious that we'd split before I gave it to him; thus leaving my wallet a lot lighter for no reason. I felt cruel for thinking this, there were no indicators that the relationship was going to end anytime soon, so why couldn't I commit to buying a gift? 

Anxieties about the future are super normal and valid. Wondering if the relationship will last is normal and valid. However, make sure it doesn't taint the way you treat her. For example, I just said 'fuck it' and bought the gift anyways. I know my partner will love it, and if we're split by the time it gets here or by the time the celebration comes, I can re-sell it or re-gift it. No biggie, it's money wasted but it happens. 

Also, spending a good amount of money on a partner is totally fine! No matter how cheap or expensive, as long as she likes it, then it's the thought that counts. I'm sure she'll love the hoodie!! Also, coming from a girl myself, maybe spray a little cologne or perfume on it, I always think that's just the sweetest thing and it reminds me of my partner <3

If you were seriously trying to ask her if you could have an open or polyamorous relationship, this was not the way to do it. Setting boundaries in these types of relationships is crucial, and you could have maturely spoke to her about your fears or jealous feelings. 

If it really was joking around, why did you hold the grudge for so long? She tried to defuse the situation, but you continued to hold this anger towards her and continued to beat her up for it. She most likely thinks she's annoying in these situations because you act cold or have little patience for her. 

I don't think you can win her back on this one. Continue to seek professional help, learn how to let things go, and learn how to get your anger out in other ways. She is not your punching bag. She is a human being. 

Take a walk, write an angry letter, blast music with headphones, anything. Get your anger out, think your words through, and don't react when you're frenzied and frustrated.

It's usually either because they're in a very bad situation, where they have to commit crimes in order to have their basic needs met (such as housing, utilities, food), or because they fell under the influence of their friends who were also criminal, or because they have a mental illness/personality disorder, or any combination of those. Some are greedy and have a financial motivation, and irrationally take big risks to get as much as they want. But should we put people in conditions where they get raped and beaten up by their fellow prisoners on a routinely basis, often contracting deadly diseases, just because they acted irrationally (once again, something one has no control of)?

As someone who not only experienced poverty which almost pushed them to committing a crime, but also suffers from paranoid schizophrenia which, when was undetected and untreated, could also likely lead to arrest (because of acting upon one's delusions), I can tell you that criminals aren't bad or evil people, no matter how bad the crime they committed is. Even those ISIS fighters didn't just magically decide to run around severing heads and destroying historical artifacts.

What's even more fucked up, they do that shit knowing I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia and just figure they can get away with it because I, supposedly, have auditorial hallucinations.. I don't find that the human brain can produce an actual, human voice wavelength.

               science would be able to read thoughts, in theory, if it produced a solid sound wavelength.. correct?

username#00589,comment,2021-07-10 17:01:35,,"To date, it has been the only commercial I've ever seen produced by the FBI and since then, ingrained into my memory.. I would like to say that it aired somewhere near 6-8 years ago, though that is a variable that I am uncertain about, and broadcasted during the evening news of CNN -

Technology, for those whom can't comprehend, is far more advanced than what is lead to believe, mostly kept secret by these agencies and the military. That is until there is practical use and it won't disturb the status quo.. the commercial contained information regarding the ability to generate video surveillance, projected from the camera of cells phones in a 360 view field, all the while being capable to extend somewhere near 5-7 feet away from the device.

It had been my first introduction to what I believe is of quantum mechanics, the ability of instant transmission and the capability of photons.

EDIT:

Now that I've put some thought to it.. I'm remembering it to have been when I was, not much, but a bit younger than 6-8 years ago. I don't find the integrity to have been jeopardized by what I thought had been the time line, it still has been the last commercial I have ever seen or heard of.. ever, of it's kind.

Wouldn't it be next to nothing for a God, as mighty as they say, to absolve such atrocities from what he has created or is it as simple as mental conditioning? To have unwanted thoughts is a disorder for most, an affliction created by Him theoretically and yet to be cured by man BUT through diligence and the will power to want can it subside. To allow for such thoughts to continue is intent to not change or giving up, allowing sin to happen within them by choice. I do not believe a single person, taking your example for instance, would think ""I want to fuck her"" unintentionally without any bit of them wanting that it wanting to think that.

As far as biblically goes, I find that most if not all of it has become fiction. Too many prints and uncertainty of translation to truly understand it's meaning. Even so, perfectly translated, we are THOUSANDS of years evolved past these trivial testaments and I do not find it possible to truly know God's intentions as man.. a being so high that it created the Earth, Heaven and man is not understandable to humans.

My brother walks by to ask if I got it handled, headed to our seat, knowing I did. I look out into the store to see fire and ash as I grab mine and Eric's coffee, as well and make my way to our booth.

Eric starts his morning off with a few too many cigarettes, shared with me if need be and a radioactive amount McDonalds coffee as he reads Psalms 1:19 and a prayer he wrote casting all unclean and demons out of the lobby and those whom wish to stay, sacrificed to the one true, God the Almighty. His breakfast was often to Jesus Christ and I sat with forgiveness for the man, knowing he had got crucifixion for commiting sin. 

""Here is a 5.00, do me a favor and get some donuts from the bakery?"" Eric says to me.

I stood for too much time deciding on which selection to get and a voice goes, 

""Is he going to pay for that?""

My mind wanders, a fissure shakes Walmart as my vision blurrs. My angel arrives, splitting the brimstone and the baker says something like, 

""He's got soul.""

[Not to be missconveyed of my loyalty to our President] 

I had instantly lost conscious ability over my holy spirit for the span of 20 - 30 minutes, from then on, I became an animal and let the ""possession"" take over my brain. Not in fact I had become ravenous or committed harm though I had a grasp of how this had been done at the time and I fought back [mentally and out loud, to myself, while man happened to be listening and watching] with a righteous reason to harm, not to myself, but those participating. I had no consulting other than trying to convey the problem I had been experiencing to several others, whom did not speak with me, which led me to voice I was going to hang myself and that is not anything I would consciously decide in actually ever actually doing and the idea I had voiced a plea with how serious what ever had been happening, comfortably scaring my soul considering I knew who was participating and the only help they would offer was to tell me I had [been] and was schizophrenic.

I had been given a Hepititus B shot, getting blood work [Hepititus C was found, curable] and a later date, finding the small amount of belongings I had on the front porch. 

I spent close to a year of said possession of receiving hidious images to my brain and at times, had my eyes [tilt up, eyelids closed], almost [a] stuck [feeling] , viewing these images along with what the radio had been saying, which had hardly been kind until they agreed to give me cancer and/or death with radiomagnetic frequency sent majority to my brain to the point I had produced glow in the dark, spotted semen and later orange. 

I had sent word through Army Inscom, McDonald's online survey, FBI and CIA [forums] of information, not only concerning my life, but potentially others and later resorted to Twitter. [All said information sent, sober and my own work][and had flown a sign in Prescott, Arizona, to call Army Inscom and use said messaging forums]

That being said, most humans in the world have an issue that God is a word, which is logical considering the beginning pages do state that He is unpercievable, so how should He have a name but if you surround yourself with people who cannot comprehend the idea and what that has to offer in eternal life in heaven...

A business (Herosaver Inc) decides to advertise on a site, let's say  So Herosaver contacts the site and says:

> Hi, I'd like to advertise on your site - here is some money to place our product front and center.

And Independent responds:
>   Great, that will be $5 a day for a 2X2 space on the left side of our home page (or whatever)

Okay cool. There's a deal. Independent gets paid by Herosaver to run ads on their page.

username#00601,post,2018-08-22 19:22:19,TIFU by starting the ant apocalypse in my car,"Obligatory this didn't happen today disclaimer...it was actually one year ago today and it came up on one of my social media ""back on this day"" apps and thought it would fit here:


I've been doing a program with cleaning pennies. It involves dipping pennies into different solutions to see which one cleans the best. The liquids being tested are soapy water, vinegar and salt solution, and Mello-Yello. These are poured into those little salad dressing cups for easy distribution. I did this program last week, and started a new program today. I took in the new materials for this week's lessons, and took out the box with the cups of solution in them.


Now, having made this mistake before, I just put the box in front of my car so that the vinegar and salt solution didn't stay in the hot car for 3 hours. Been there, done that, it takes forever to get the smell out. Left the box of liquids out of the car for the duration of the program. I thought it was a sweet idea, I was feeling pretty smart.


I come out of the program, grab the box, and throw it in the passenger seat. As I head to my next meeting, I see movement in my passenger seat. Ants! If you leave a box that contains cups of Mello-Yello on the ground outside you will have a TON of ants to deal with. All over my car. I can't really do anything about them while I'm driving, but I get to my next location. I take the box out of my car, and once again put it on the ground in front of it. I didn't have time to fully investigate the problem, or deal with the box in question. But the ants couldn't be allowed to stay in the car.


I go to my next meeting, I finish the next meeting and I leave. As I'm driving down the street, I see an ant on my dashboard. Just wandering around. I was suddenly reminded of a problem I had forgotten. And something else I had forgotten. 


I forgot the box. Not only did I forget the box, I drove FORWARD from my parking space. I ran OVER the box, and didn't even realize it. I'm too self-conscious as a citizen to just leave it laying in the street, so I turn around to go get it. I'm on the phone with a co-worker at the time, explaining through giggles and tears why I was running late, so I'm using one hand to pile all the cups into what's left of the original box, which I then pick up.


Now, why there aren't any trash-cans downtown, I may not ever understand. I'm not sure what the residents of this fine city thought of their 4-H Agent roaming around the streets, one hand holding the phone to my ear apologizing, the other holding a half broken box with multicolored liquid leaking out, with that arm crawling with ants, likely resembling Moses hunting for the promised land. No trash can to be found.


Well, I can't just leave it in the street! So I turn my cargo mat over to the rubber side in my car, place the leaky, ant-y box on it, scrape the 20 ants off my arm and take off down the street to my mercifully close apartment, which has a dumpster. I throw the box in the dumpster, scratch off any straggling ants and head up to my apartment. Which I don't have a key for, because it is in my bookbag that I left back at my office! And of course heading back to the office was spent doing the most distracted driving I've ever done, being that I was playing whack-a-mole with the ants in my air vents. I continue to find roaming ants and ant bodies for the remainder of the week.


TL;DR: I made a series of small mistakes that led to me creating the perfect environment for ants to infest my car in Armageddon style.

username#00601,comment,2018-04-02 14:42:37,,"This happened one night when everyone was late getting home from work, and I happened to be the first one there. We had three dogs, my parent's pit bull (Minnie), my sister's chihuahua/lab mix (Celly) and my beagle (Trav). So after coming home, I wanted to get the dogs out for a walk ASAP so they could take care of business in the yard. It was dark, but I thought I would kill two birds with one stone by taking two of them out at one time. Minnie was behaved enough to go run out into the side yard (roughly two acres) do her business and run back to the porch, no problem. My Trav...he was a beagle and if you've ever had a beagle you know that you can't just let them ""out"" or the first scent they catch, they're gone. 

So I let Minnie out the door, she ran out to the yard, as usual, and I hooked up Trav to the leash and we went out. The top of the yard was a curved shape, with the road defining the barrier between our yard and the woods across the street. 

I'm walking Trav, trying to catch a glimpse of Minnie in the field as I'm walking along, just to make sure she was still there. We got to the top of the field, Trav did his business, and as we were about to turn around, I saw Minnie run across the road and go into the woods. I'm a little pissed at that, because she's NEVER done that. So I'm walking up to where she went in, and she came back out on the road, a good 300 feet ahead of me. Minnie is all black black so all I could really see were her eyes, flashing in the night ahead of us a good ways, and her outline barely visible. Trav catches a scent, starts going full on Beagle snorts at the ground, no interest in potty after that, so I call Minnie to come on, turn around and start walking towards the house. Across the field I see Minnie sitting on the porch, patiently waiting at the door.

Which meant there was something behind me, with a general shape and eye height of a medium sized dog. I have no idea what it was, figured that's why Trav had started going nuts, and never found out what it was because I skipped the road and high tailed it across the field.

She has not showered in three weeks. Nor changed her clothes. She smells quite bad and when she comes into my room it lingers after she leaves. Im sensitive to smells so im not really spending alot of time in her room(its a mess and smells bad)

She told me ages ago to just tell her if she smells but the last time i did that a couple months back she got defensive and blamed her pain and implied i was in the wrong for suggesting she shower when she can barely walk.

 I told her we have a shower chair she can sit on that and ill use the detachable shower head to wash her if she cant ,and she still claims thats too hard to do. She has clean clothes but she refuses to change them until she showers. Her hair is matted as well because she hasnt brushed it in months. It also reeks. 

Her room is a disaster she has cups of piss in her room because she ""cant leave her room easily"". So you can imagine the smell of her room. I told her over a week ago she needs to throw the piss out and she either hasnt or is still pissing in cups. Idk. 

Ive told her many times if she is seriously THAT disabled she NEEDS to see her doctor asap instead of making excuses to not go. Im not a caregiver, i deal with alot of pain and mental health stuff. I can hardly keep up with my own care and all the housework that no one else does.

I no longer feel hungry at all. When I force myself to eat because ya kinda need to eat I'm lucky if I can't get a single bite down. For instance all  day yesterday all I ate was two saltine crackers. I feel full and nauseous after a bite of food to the point I cannot even force myself to take another bite and if I do when I try to swallow it makes me gag and I vomit right away.
Im able to get water down thank goodness, so I'm staying well hydrated.

On top of that 2 weeks ago I stopped being able to shit without laxatives and I have this CONSTANT pressure and pain in my lower back that feels like I need to shit 24/7 and nothing relieves it, not laxatives, not shitting etc. 

In three weeks I've lost around 23lbs. I am not trying to lose weight, so this is concerning I would expect to lose a couple pounds from lack of eating but over 20? I am obese, I was 242lbs before this started and im down to around 216lbs but again I was not trying to lose weight, and I dont exercise the most waking i do most days is standing to do housework like dishes. 

What could be going on? I mentioned it to my Endo today and she really recommends I see my PCP for this. Im scheduled to see my PCP again the end of the month, but I'm severely worried that another 10 days like this could hurt me. I've never had anything like this happen before even when I'm sick with a cold etc I still have an appetite.

 I don't feel sick unless I eat, then I'm nauseous for hours after even though it's a small amount of food I manage to eat.  

Vomiting happens on occasion, maybe a few times a week. I'll get crazy nauseous out of the blue at random and end up puking violently until dry heaves. After which I go back to feeling fine.  Also if I tried to force food down after the first bite or so (after my brain said I was full) the act of swallowing immediately trigger my gag reflex and I puke.

We also have a smart thermostat, which is nice but honestly useless because in late fall/winter we set it to a comfortable temp and dont touch it. Very rarely is it turned off or adjusted, to the point theres no need to be lazy, also its like 15 feet from my bedroom lol i dont know why it was installed tbh (we rent)

Im not getting beyond that. I dont need a smart stove, or washer small house its not hard to hear the beep when a load is done. Or hear when it stops. A smart fridge would piss me off cause i wouldnt trust it to be accurate.

Would wear clothes for over a week without washing them, sure he showered everyday but dirty clothes don't help that at all. He had both big toes with such bad ingrown toenails, they were constantly infected and bleeding and he, instead of doing the rational thing and seeing a doctor, or getting some  nail clippers and trimming the nail, he would contort himself and go to town on the nail and dead skin around the nail with his teeth. 

Now when I say this is was horrifying image what it smelled like!? And he did this constantly a couple times a day because ""it helps the pain to remove the dead skin daily"" 

Well that leads to this, one day I'm in the living room watching tv, he was in the shower and suddenly i hear him scream in horror so I go to see what had happened I open the door and ask if he is ok.
And then he tells me this:

""I was chewing on my nail and there was an abscess and it popped in my mouth so I got a mouth full of putrid pus, it was disgusting ""

I was so revolted I had to leave the room. It was bad enough seeing him to that shit on a normal day this topped that by 1000.

He did eventually get them fixed after 7 years.

 I wasn't able to function. A friend who lives 1500milea away offered me to come visit for a couple weeks to get my head together as her mom knew I was overwhelmed and she thought a break would help. 

My now ex let me go. 3 days after I got here I messaged him and told him I wasn't coming back. Honestly I don't remember most of the first couple years I was here. The divorce was final with a year, I didn't contest him asking full custody. I was so sick during this period that I was highly dangerous to myself and the hospitals kept pushing for long term care because I kept bouncing in and out of the psych ward. 

My ex was abusive, and not willing to let me get the help I needed to be a stay at home mom. I did NOT want to leave my kids but I saw no options I had no income, couldn't work, had a place to live  but that was it. Everything I owned was in a backpack I took with me. I left everything behind even my stuffed bear id has since the  day I was born. 

Now I'm married again to a sweet women , I'm a husband now as I've been out as a trans man for 3 years now. I speak to my kids a few times a week on video call.

Another guy who I was friends with showed up one morning and told me he had just taken a bunch of acid and was freaking tf out.

username#00609,comment,2024-01-22 12:26:21,,"Hi there, so I started high school in 2010 and graduated in 2014 (I just got an email a few weeks ago about the 10yr reunion.. made me feel old AF lol) Should also mention I'm from TN and my school was in BF nowhere. It wasn't tiny but not big by any means, and it was also an older building so we didn't have a lot of resources

I guess first thing I can think of is technology or lack thereof. Most of us had cellphones but it wasn't til around my senior year when everyone started getting smartphones. And you ABSOLUTELY could not have ur phone out in class, and if u got caught, the school would confiscate it. I got caught once during freshman year and they took my phone for a whole week. No one questioned it, and my parents were just pissed that I was stupid enough to get caught  We were using iPods or MP3 players to listen to music and you couldn't have those out either. The only computers were in the library and they were old AF and ran on windows XP, and you almost never saw anyone using them. We still used textbooks (and those things always weighed like 1000lbs), and wrote our notes by hand. The teacher would mostly write on the whiteboard, but if they had a videoclip or PowerPoint to show us, they would roll in the projector on a wheel-cart and you'd have to pull down the giant white projector screen from the ceiling and play it on that. Also if we were watching a movie, they would roll the TV in on the metal wheel-cart (and the tvs were also old and huge AF, the ones with VCRS built into them. And yes we did watch VHS tapes on occasion)

Social media was def a thing, but it pretty much stayed at home bc there was no way to access it at school. From 2010-2012ish Facebook was the main thing (or if u were one of the weirdos like me it was Tumblr). When insta came out, we didn't really use it that much. Long before TikTok there was Vine, which was a huge deal to us when it came out bc there was nothing else like it at the time. Also, doing YT was not cool. I did a couple random vlogs back then and people gave me shit over it. Ppl did watch YouTube, but mostly it was for viral videos and the like (Friday by Rebecca Black came out my freshman year of u can believe that, and it was the main topic of conversation for quite awhile  viral vids don't have the same impact these days) Most of us were still watching cable TV. I didn't watch my first livestream show until Orange is the New Black came out on Netflix. (2014 I believe.. streaming was just getting off the ground then)

Vaping wasn't a thing yet, so kids were smoking actual cigs and weed in the bathroom  My Junior year we got the first bomb threat, and we were all freaking tf out that day bc that was when school shootings and bombings were starting to become a real problem. We were in homeroom in the middle of the Pledge of Allegiance and the principal interrupted us and said there's a dangerous situation in the school, and everyone needed to move to the auditorium immediately. Not even the teachers knew wtf was going on and we pretty much stayed in the auditorium for the rest of the day. My senior year was the first occasion of an armed person running loose on campus.. in the middle of class our principal came over the intercom and said that the school was going on code-red lockdown. So the teacher locked the door, shut the lights off, closed the blinds on the windows and told us to be completely silent. We just had to wait until it was over like an hour later (and didn't know wtf was happening either) and after we carried on with the school day. There were no protocols or drills for it back then.

Bullying from other students was a lot worse.. Sophomore year my friend Rodney (black guy) fought this annoying ass redneck dude in the middle of English class bc the guy kept calling him the n word. Rodney got suspended for a week, the white dude only got in school suspension for 3 days  I was a little bit on the chubbier side so I got called fat pretty often, body positivity didn't start until around senior year. Stick straight hair was the norm and my hairs thick and curly so u can imagine how THAT went. Non-binary wasn't even a concept yet, and I only knew of one openly gay student during my whole time there. And he got tormented to hell. Teachers could be fucking brutal and downright abusive sometimes. I witnessed teachers (and was victim of it myself unfortunately, my Algebra 2 teacher actually cussed me out one day and called me stupid) do or say things that I know for a fact they couldn't get away with nowadays.",AskReddit

Pros: he was my most favourite boy to hug by far. He spent most his time playing video games, watching shows, reading, all which I also like, although I had a more balanced lifestyle than him. He always finished up all the leftovers. 


Cons: he had no stamina for sex and was sluggish. We couldn't do some of the physical activities I liked together, the poor guy will die. He couldn't be bothered to try losing weight at all, hes just averse to the effort and pain of exercise/diet like I know it sucks but its for his own good.

username#00613,comment,2023-08-19 15:10:41,,"No worries. There were signs for half a year, feeling depressed, feeling dissociated, cognitive decline. The breakdown happened on one ordinary night. Lost control of my thoughts, they raced away on random topics and I simply couldn't focus or stop. Had a panic attack for the first time when I realised what was going on.

It went downhill from there and too many things happened to go into detail. The episode lasted for around 3 months. I started hallucinating and became delusional. Heard voices telling me terrible things like commands to commit suicide. People were watching me and giving me dark looks, and they were also talking to each other about me either plotting against me or making fun of me. I could see a dark aura around people which are evil spirits influencing them in the name of Satan to antagonise me. Everyone in the world are psychopaths except for me. My mum had mind control powers. Its just utter terror mixed with confusion. 

Throughout all this my brain felt like scrambled eggs. I hardly slept and I felt delirious and brain foggy. When the racing thoughts are bad I basically become catatonic. For example I'd just stare at a wall for hours because I was fighting a war in my own head trying to stay sane. Sometimes I scream. 

I did try to get help and went to A&E at the mental hospital several times but I didn't get the correct help till much later because the voices were telling me to omit information or else I would get locked up in an asylum.

As far as I can tell this is how it works in my country. 99% of the locals have a home under the public housing scheme. You can't own more than one public home. But you can own as many private properties as you can afford and play landlord there. 

When I was a kid my family had a public flat but we rented it out and lived with my grandparents instead. We weren't bad landlords.

Like each day I wake up I remember less. I can remember people and events that I partook in, but not information about myself i.e how i felt, what i said or did. It feels scary and I thought I was going to die. I experienced alot of DPDR during this time and was constantly questioning if things were real or am I dreaming. There was also one occasion where I took an hour long walk with a friend and we were talking the entire time, but at the end of the walk all I remembered was that I started talking, but it felt like time had skipped to the end of the walk. 

One day it just felt like the previous me had died and I was a new soul here to pick up the pieces. I was scrambling to read my old text messages and social media to try to understand how is it i'm supposed to act and what i'm supposed to know. I listened to songs about loss to try to let go of the past and continue on with a new beginning. This amnesia lasted for 1 to 2 weeks but somehow I just settled back into my old self and started remembering things again. Very seamless transition back to normal. 

Ultimately I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Doctors never commented on my amnesia.",AskReddit

Weight lifting:
clean and jerk
fly press
bench press
lunges
military press
curls

Had I paired this with a better diet regimen, I might have lost the weight/fat faster. I just switched to a high protein diet, and it seems to be working well for me thus far.

I hope that this is encouraging and helpful. I was at 270lbs when I started this April. I'm now 225, but have more muscle.

Good luck!",loseit

username#00625,comment,2011-09-25 01:44:34,,"Yes, I was not taking into account the initial costs. However, he said monthly, and for which I was still accurate. The initial cost of getting a kitten is normally around $400 after all the vaccines. After that, its 30/month. When compared to other things, this is relatively cheap.

If you are like me, you build your own cat tree, which turns a $150 cat tree into a $30 cat tree. (Carpet and all).

Now, I am not including pet rent for apartments, I am paying $30/month on that and had to make a $250 deposit.

Not to mention, chances are, when you get the cat, within a few months, even if the person/store/shelter that you got him/her from claims to deworm, you still need to deworm. Deworming + vaccines at the same time is roughly $100. That sets you for a year unless you see more worms. My cat, Aggie, doesn't have worms any more after that.

Now, if you really want to talk the full cost of having a cat, I guess we should add in broken glasses, electronics, etc. When my cat was still a kitten, she knocked over a cup onto a turned on laptop which fried the laptop.

* Cat litter: ~$5/month


One time Expenses:

* Carrier: ~$20-30
* Collar: you can get one for $1
* Litter Box: $5-15 ... sometimes these also include the scoop

That said, on average, while the cat is in good health, monthly costs are less than $30 on average. That's even if you buy the organic cat food.

They're about the same cost as a dog, if not slightly cheaper. Though, I am not going to try to dissuade you from your opinion of cats. To each his own.",funny

username#00625,comment,2011-07-21 18:38:33,,"Since I agree with your response I'm jumping straight to the questions.

Well, honestly, the tax cuts are a hairy issue. My instinct is to say that a flat tax is the most fair (as long as it exempts those under a certain threshold), though, in reality that isn't the case. That said, I am not going to give a very straight answer.

I would like to see small businesses keep the tax exemptions. Under the Clinton administration, I saw many small businesses go under in the area that I was in because it was more economical for the owners (who were already rich) to just pull out and close shop than to keep operating. (My own mother was laid off for said reason). However, the rich tend to have most of their money invested where it's not getting taxed anyways. I'm not really sure how much people who are worth several million actually get taxed due to not really having ""income"" but rather just investments that just feed into themselves instead of being extracted. ""Living off interest.""

If there was a way to guarantee that small to mid sized businesses would not feel this, I would be all for it. I'm not sure if that answers your question, but I hope that it at least explains my reservations about such taxes on the ""rich.""",politics
username#00625,comment,2011-07-21 17:15:59,,"I agree. I'm closest to libertarian in thought, so I prefer things to be privatized. However, the time to move jobs from the public sector back out to the private sector is NOT during a recession. It just causes a void in that market. 

Also, spending cuts from the government also affects all the defense contractors dramatically. Typically it's the small/mid-sized non-corporate defense contractors that take the biggest hit and are inevitably bought out by someone like Boeing.

However, cutting spending and reducing taxes can work as long as spending is cut more than the reduction of taxes. This fails normally in getting passed because the lobbyists have too much sway and are able to keep the funding coming to their organizations and are able to also tip the scale into a higher debt creation rate by getting taxes reduced too much on certain fronts.

It's all politics. It's about keeping one's votes up and pockets full. This applies to both parties. If a third party made its way up, it would become corrupt as well.

Wikileaks itself went about things wrong, but there was a small amount of justification for what they did. It showed that the public desires organizations to police governments. I see no justification for organization such as Lolsec or Anonymous, though. When dealing with corruption of individuals, the governments should handle it.

He had a common, incurable, deadly virus destroy his kidney function and he had to be euthanized within days. He was sixteen, and I'd grown up with him, he was my best friend and my only confidant at that point. He'd been through everything with me and was the only reason I didn't end my life during an abusive childhood. 

The vet let me stay in the room but was pissed at me for the kidney failure (it had been a different vet that diagnosed it) and acted like *I* was the reason my best friend was sick. So she didn't let me hold him. It seemed like he had a moment of clarity, got up, and started meowing and staring at me from across the room. She laid him back down and euthanized him, he was gone before I ever got to hold him again.

My mom told me he would have been happier if I'd held him. His last moments had been panic and crying out at me. It kills me, I think about it every single day. I keep his ashes with me, but I can't forgive myself for not holding him, I should have spoken up to the vet. I really hope he knows how loved he was. He used to sleep cuddled up to me every night and followed me everywhere. He lost a lot of weight a couple of years before he died and I stayed up with him and spoon fed him wet kitten food until he gained some back. He was old and would get cold, so I'd carry him around wrapped in a blanket on cold days. He loved this game where he'd hop into a little cloth box (a little storage box, but it was his choo choo) and I'd drag it around the room, even as an old cat that was on arthritis medicine and that liked to lay in one spot all day. I really hope those were the thoughts in his head, and not that his best friend had abandoned him.

username#00635,post,2021-02-18 16:03:42,I have vivid nightmares that keep me up if I don't take something to help me sleep.,"25F, schizophrenic, previously diagnosed with PTSD. I can't take Ambien/most prescription sleep medications because of the fact that they can cause me to become delusional, so I take an OTC sleep aid. However, recently due to the blizzard terrorizing the US, I have run out. It's been a problem for years, I'll fall asleep, have a nightmare that feels like it's happening to me (usually a PTSD flashback) and I'll wake up unable to go back to sleep because it still feels like it just happened. 

I feel like consistently taking OTC sleeping meds isn't healthy, but I can't sleep for more than 2-3 hours without them. That and my nightmares cause me to kick, roll, and headbutt in my sleep according to my fiance, and  I have rolled off of my bed and hurt myself by falling on several occasions during these nightmares. As bad as it sounds, I can't take melatonin because it isn't ""strong enough"" and the nightmares still happen. I usually take the ""for sleep, not a cold"" diphenhydramine, because while it leaves me incredibly groggy, it makes me either not dream or not feel like I'm dreaming.

He had little 'S's on each lapel, black uniform, the same style hat with a little medallion and red band across it. I had to do a double take, because I legitimately thought he was wearing an SS Officer uniform without the lightening bolts or swastika arm band. US Army officers have a different outfit (still an overcoat and hat, but different style), why did they go with one that more resembles an SS Officer, and not something more similar to a US Army Officer? Like I understand why it couldn't look too similar, but why that specific look? I even asked a few coworkers if they saw the similarities, and pretty much any who knew what I was talking about agreed, especially with the hat.

username#00635,post,2020-10-18 04:19:43,"My (25F) Best Friend (26F) is an incel, and I'm starting to get worried.","""Carly"" (fake name) and I have been friends since we were kids. We're practically sisters at this point. We grew up in similarly bad situations, and both got out of them. She was always bigger than me (taller, weighed more) but gained weight after her parents' divorce. Nothing I've ever judged her for, she was finally in a good place. 

Here's where things get dicey, though. I had a couple of ""boyfriends"" (boys I held hands with and kissed, nothing more) in high school. We bonded even more over the fact that we were virgins (sounds dumb, but we called ourselves ""the dumb nerdy kids"") and eventually I got into a serious relationship at 20 and slept with the guy. She lost her shit because we'd ""only"" been dating 3 months (she believed in a year minimum, but preferred saving herself for marriage, deeply catholic). We fought over it, but eventually patched things up. After a few years, he and I broke up, and we were both relieved, she admitted she wouldn't wait until marriage anymore. Our friendship was back to normal.

Now, I moved out at 19, as of today, Carly still lives with her dad and younger sister. Carly has never dated, kissed, or been anything more than friends with a boy. I eventually got together with my now fiance. Problem is, he's exactly Carly's type (physically, at least, he wants kids and isn't Catholic). She got depressed and stopped visiting. I helped her sign up for online dating, but she refused to message men unless they met her standards. That's okay, but Carly is 300lbs, never worked, never gone to school, and stays home all day playing video games at her dad's house. Her standards were that he must be over 6'1"" (she's 5'10"", so I can kinda understand that), muscular, zero fat, Catholic, make good money, marry her in a year, and doesn't want kids. When any man who wasn't ripped or had any fat on him messaged her, she would fall into a depression and say only ""fat bastards"" wanted her. 

So, I did what I could. I helped moderate her account, and deleted messages from guys who would make her depressed to see. I helped her match up with some dudes who shared her views, and let her vet them. She always found one flaw or another. Not religious enough, not tall enough, not muscular enough. She eventually gave up with OLD altogether.

Now Carly is constantly over, calling and texting me at work, and being generally there to complain about how I've got a happy life and she doesn't. I've told her to put herself out there (impossible now, thanks COVID) and try talking to people face to face, and that personality is the most important thing. She's however adopted her own incel-like ideology.  ""Men only want bimbos"", ""all men are pigs"", etc. She's even started asking me for details on my sex life so she can ""live vicariously"" through me.

What do I do? I still love her, and when she's not complaining about men or being weird, she's still a good friend. How do I help get her out of this toxic mindset?",relationship_advice

I put it off for too long and only went because I was jaundicing and had complications because of it. I regret it at this point because maybe I could have just died. Between the emergency room visits and surgery, I'm now over $20k in medical debt. I work full time and can barely pay rent or my bills.  What do I do? Will I be taken to court over this? I paid my life savings for my surgery. Insurance covered barley any of it. Even then, I didn't even get close to paying it off. My life savings was made from working from the time I was 17, I'm 25 now. Some of it was from doing softcore porn when I was 22, but I was absolutely desperate, and I'm with someone who loves me and is pretty much the only family I have, I couldn't go back to that. I couldn't risk losing him to make money doing that, and I was so suicidal from compromising myself like that. 


I'm trying to move up at my job. I'm paying for insurance and it doesn't seem to cover much even after paying out the deductible. I have some management experience, but it gets overlooked for those with more. I'm trying really hard and I'm scared. If they take me to court, could I go to jail?

username#00635,post,2020-06-29 02:05:50,How can I [24F] cope with rape that happened 9+ years ago?,"I'm sorry if this is a little disorganized, I'm trying to gather my thoughts, it's been a lot to deal with, especially recently.

There's some backstory to this. My parents got divorced when I was sixteen, and my dad raped me repeatedly starting when I was (I think) nine years old by drugging me with sleeping medication and raping me  while I was unconscious. My mother [40sF] was relatively unaware, but she did have some suspicion upon finding child pornography of what she said were ""very young kids"" on his computer when I was a teenager. My mom stopped most inappropriate behavior she saw him do with me (comment on my breasts, rub my stomach and tell me I looked pregnant, touch my butt/breasts, ask me to kiss his lips/sit in his lap, etc.) My parents got divorced because my father had been physically abusive towards me and my brother [23M] and mentally abusive to all of us. 


The day after we left, she sat me and my brother down separately and asked us each if my dad had ever done anything inappropriate to us. I lied and said he'd only touched me. I had repressed a lot of the actual rape, and at times questioned if it was just nightmares, even though I'd often wake up with a lot of vaginal pain and bleeding. That and I'd ""started my period"" at 9, because I woke up bleeding horribly and in pain, but didn't have another period until I was eleven or twelve. I had also developed a lot of mental health issues that made me occasionally question myself/my thinking, and I had lost a lot of my memories from before I was 10. That and I knew she would try to hurt him if she knew, and I was scared of losing my mom, I felt like I'd lost my dad, even though I hated him, some small part of me still loved him in a weird way. That small amount of love faded after I tried to contact him and he was verbally abusive and shared everything I said with his parents. 


A lot has happened since then. I met a man [25M], fell in love, moved out, was in that relationship for five years before it ended due to his infidelity.  I told him about the rape and how it seemed hazy, and he said it probably ""didn't happen"" because I bled the first few times we had sex (I hadn't had consensual sex up to that point, so I count him as my first) but I also had a lot of issues with my vaginal muscles tensing up to the point where it took a lot for penetration, despite me trying to relax. I was later diagnosed with vaginismus, and even later diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia ( bi-polar type schizoaffective disorder) and depression. So I really pushed it into the back of my head. 

After we broke up, I got with my old friend/current boyfriend/hopefully future husband [32M] because he's amazing and the only one who's listened to me when it comes to my trauma/mental illness and treats me wonderfully despite it. I'm also in therapy and we've discussed repressed and hazy memories. The thing is though, once I started accepting the fact that I was raped and trying to cope with it, it's just gotten so much heavier on me. I broke down and told my mom everything, and she cried because she said there were so many signs (running out of sleeping pills despite not using them, his inappropriate behavior towards me and the comments he'd make) and she was scared it had happened, but didn't want to think he would do that. But she said it made so much sense and apologized for not seeing it sooner. 

My boyfriend and therapist have been huge, huge helps, as well as some close friends. But there are times where I just feel panicky and can't cope. There are certain things that make me nervous during sex (admittedly much less with my current bf than with my ex), and I'm just wondering how I can teach myself to move on. How can I cope with something that happened years ago? I have this fear that my dad will just show up one day when my boyfriend's not there to help me (we live 4k miles away from each other and he doesn't even know what state I'm in, it's very far from likely) and take me away. How do you get past something like that? Why is it so heavy now, when the last time was 8 or 9 years ago?",relationship_advice
username#00635,post,2020-06-11 17:55:28,"My [24F] brother [23M] has turned into a spoiled child, and is ruining our relationships with our family","My brother and I both grew up in a really shitty situation, we were dirt poor, we had an abusive father, and a lasseiz-faire mother. My mother has since divorced and remarried. We weren't really close as kids due to him being rambunctious and me mainly being quiet and shy.  

My mom and I sort of had a falling out (later repaired, ti some extent), and long story short, I moved with $300 to my name from the west coast to chase an now ex to the south. I met my best friend of 3 years, and now current boyfriend of a year [32M], made some money, and established myself. We moved in together about six months ago, and it's been wonderful, and shockingly easy. We fit into each other's lives just about perfectly, and we both come from shitty situations, so we've helped each other with a lot of trauma. My brother still lives with my mother on the west coast.

We were aware he hadn't had a job for more than a week or two, and he told me he was really trying to get on his feet, he just needed a push. So, we offered to bring him down to the south for a week or two, and give him that push. He immediately hopped on it, so we bought him plane tickets, made our spare room into a guest bedroom, and told him to plan for things he wanted to do. A month later, he's stepping off the plane. We immediately took him to dinner, he was polite, and then we got home.

He immediately seemed to change. He said he hadn't planned anything (we had some backups, luckily) and wanted to go fo his room. We figured it was just jetlag, showed him his room, and we all went to bed. The next morning, we got some breakfast, and showed him around our town. He complained about nearly everything. We decided to take him to dinner with a mutual friend of ours, who had just come out as gay to her extremely christian family. She was telling us about everyone, and how many people reacted positively, and he interrupts her with, ""Why are you talking about these people? I don't know ANY of them!"" During the dinner he proceeded to insult my job and our house. Miffed, we went home.

Over the next week, he manhandled our cat, screamed at me for talking when a song he liked was on the car radio, complained about everything we went to do, told us ""I've worked, you dont need to tell me what work is"" when we tried explaining our jobs, asked us to take him to a bar constantly so he could drink (neither of us drink a lot), slammed his entire body into the floor several times (we live in an upstairs duplex, I'm 120lbs, my boyfriend is 195lbs, and my brother is 300+lbs, and we tried lightly in worries of upsetting our neighbor), asked/joker about smoking weed in our home when we told him it was drug free, and after my boyfriend emotionally told him about the family members he'd lost, my brother proceeded to point to a vase in the house and ask, ""is that an urn?"" We explained it was a vase. He loudly asks, ""Oh, is the ""VASE"" full of human ashes?"" And loudly called it an urn and made suggestions that it was actually just full of ashes and we didnt want to tell him until my boyfriend was shaking and had to leave the room. We paid for everything while he was here, and the last day we learned he'd been sent with money to pay for himself, but had used it on DVDs and toys.

After he left, I texted him he was no longer allowed in our home, and that he had hurt my boyfriend and I, and that when he screamed at me my boyfriend had almost taken him out of the car and fought him, I said he really needed to watch his attitude before he got himself into trouble. He got pissed off and said ""not everyone is like (boyfriend)"". My mom is mad because I confronted him, but my grandparents and uncle and aunt are on my side and saying he's a disrespectful asshole who's treated family like that for years, and would have deserved to have his ass kicked. Now my grandparents/uncle/aunt are fighting with my mom and brother and my mom and brother are fighting with us. My mom's husband confides in me that my brother is a terrible strain on him, and that he's fully supporting him and my disabled mother.

I don't know what to do. It took so long to repair the relationship with my mom, but I'm losing my mom and brother again. My family is worried he's gonna spend the rest of my mom's life smoking weed and playing video games and then try to get me to be my mom when she dies. I want to help him still, but I worry he's past being able to help. Should I just call it all a loss and cut ties?",relationship_advice

I agree and I've told him a few times since he got fired that he's still 100% a man and still absolutely loved and nothing will stop that. Luckily he's made a few plans to get out so he can kind of hopefully shake some of this off before hitting the applications again. He did reach out to the current supervisor (the one that fired him) because his boss won't be back for a few more weeks, and they told him he was blacklisted from the company for being fired. The management structure is weird (you've got several levels of supervisor) and the supervisors directly under the ones that fired him want him back and think it was a non-reason. 


I've helped find some things that he's looking into because he wasn't sure what direction to look in, and I do think finding something else will help. He made a very good salary at his last job and most places won't offer that without a degree, so I don't think that helped the issue.

The difference is I don't feel attracted to them when I meet them. I'm not at all attracted, in any way, shape, or form to a person I don't know well. When I first met my husband I simply thought he was kinda silly, and that I might want to be friends with him. I was friends with him for three years before I was suddenly hit with feelings of attraction (and it hit like a freight train at 200mph, I previously had a platonic 'friend love' before it quickly developed into a crush after I felt attracted to him). It's not like I don't notice someone takes good care of themselves, or dresses nicely, it's that none of it elicits any sort of attraction, aesthetic, objective, or physical.

username#00635,comment,2021-03-25 22:16:37,,"So, the demisexual identity is interesting. Unfortunately it gets tossed around way too much now and has kinda killed the legitimacy of it, which sucks because I've identified as demisexual since I learned the term in 2010ish. The basic thing is: you experience zero attraction to people without a deep emotional connection. Like a stranger is never hot to you. Or an acquaintance. It's like being gay and everyone else thinks this person of the opposite gender is smoking hot, and you...just don't see it. It does nothing for you. Once you become close friends with someone, it's like a door cracks open. You might find the attractive, you might not. I liked it because I could never identify with people who said things like, ""oh he's cute"" about some random dude. 


And then it turned into ""you can be demisexual and experience attraction to people! You're still demisexual if you have an ONS with a hot stranger! You're still valid if you experience aesthetic attraction to random people!"" And suddenly I was back to not being able to relate with anyone. When I try to explain to ""demisexual"" people now I legitimately don't find anyone aside from my husband attractive and likely never will, it makes them act like I'm the weird one.",TrueOffMyChest

username#00635,comment,2021-02-18 15:18:54,,"Full explanation from a Texan:

Texas didn't just get cold/snow. We've had snow occasionally. Dallas-Fort Worth got record breaking amounts of snow, as did many small surrounding towns. We had no way to plow or de-ice the roads because snow usually lasts one day here, so we're all stuck at home. Not too terrible so far, aside from the lack of food or access to it.

And THEN power went out for millions. For a lot of them, it's been out for four days. Our houses weren't built for cold, so it seeped in. Our houses also weren't built for snow, some people had their roofs collapse due to the snow. Keep in mind these are below freezing temperatures, with windchill that brings it well into the negatives. So we're frozen with no power,  and no way to reach the places that do have power.

And then (there's more) many cities had their water shut off. And they've been without power/water for days. People have died. The areas that didn't lose water were told that they had to boil their water for it to be safe due to contamination. So, those of us without power are also now without water expect for whatever we might have bottled. I've seen people setting small fires on their stove to boil a pot of water.

Cut off contact if you haven't (or they haven't) already, that's instrumental. You might wanna stay friends, but I guarantee this is a massive step forward. Then, focus on YOU. You spend so long pulling your identity together with them, that you might have lost some of yourself. Get back into old hobbies they didn't like. Spend time with friends. Lost friends due to the relationship or didn't have any before? Join clubs. Do online gaming. Anything that thrusts you out into a situation with other people with similar interests. He made me an extreme introvert, so I fought myself to become more extroverted. I started asking people at work to hang out--and it worked. When COVID is finally dead, do something you've wanted to do. Go somewhere, if you can. Or even pre-COVID ending, go to the park, immerse yourself in your surroundings. When they inevitably cross your mind, it helps to think about the low things. The things that are better now. Therapy didn't work for me (in that area, in other areas it did) so I became my own therapist. I found online forums where I could rant and get the icky feelings out and found people going through similar things. I wrote letters I burned. You're so worthy of your own love and time, and when you're safe and have built yourself up, and you become your own biggest advocate, you'll be able to meet someone new that's better for you. I got together with my fiance because I finally found myself.

They're objects to me, and you are too."" (Actual words from his face hole) Then he became abusive because I wasn't a person to him anymore.

Nope. That is a specific trait some men and women have. My relationship has a ""zero porn"" (dealbreaker) boundary. We both agreed on it, and agreed to trust each other (we don't snoop lol). Personally we both think porn is weird (esp if you put it in the context of getting off to watching other people have sex) and that the industry is gross. But that's neither here nor there. Porn in a relationship is a boundary you set together, no boundary with it is wrong or right, HOWEVER, ""don't masturbate to my family members photos"" should go without saying.


Especially your little sister. That's so worrying. Not to be too personal, my dad was a pedophile. He started with child porn, then escalated. He's known your sister since she was 12, that's so concerning. You don't know what his tendencies are if he can hide something like that, you could be married to a man who was eyeing her at TWELVE. So, what else might he be looking at? Is your house being put at risk for an FBI raid? I know that's an extreme idea, but it's a situation bordering on extremes. 


Get out of there. You don't want to be up at night in 15 years when you're worried he might hurt your kids or their friends.

username#00635,comment,2020-12-27 07:41:24,,"Okay, older thread, older comment but I want to provide a different perspective. My ex let me meet his ex. They were on good terms, she was nice to me, they were friends. The breakup wasn't insane, it was harder on him than on her, but they both seemingly moved on, and it was amicable. It had been seven years since the breakup, I figured nothing would still be there. I didn't see her much after that but he told me they'd still hang out. And I was super cool with it. And that whole time they were fucking. 


I lied to myself. I was the ""cool girlfriend"" who didn't mind he was hanging out with his ex, minus the obvious sign that he was still hanging out with her because he was still holding onto her. And when she moved on, he'd already cheated, it wasn't a big step to do it more. I left when I found out he'd cheated with a close friend. 


When my current boyfriend's ex hit him up via text, I freaked out. I didn't get mad at him, I didn't yell or anything, or fight, but I waited until he went to work and I locked myself in the bedroom and sobbed. My first boyfriend dropped me constantly for his ex. I just knew the breakup was coming. She'd wanna meet up, they would, and they'd have sex, it had happened while he was single. There was obviously something still there in my mind because he'd gone back as a single man. He was more honest, so he'd tell me and admit she was always better, just like my ex had told me. He didn't do any of that. My boyfriend told her he was with me, we live together, and that he's probably going to marry me. 


But that anxiety all came rushing back from my first boyfriend. The things he'd said about how much better she was. And then the little comments people who knew my boyfriend more as a single man made, shortly after we'd gotten together, one in an attempt to split us up. But I just knew.


Even with all of his reassurance,  which took a while and reassured me, he's loving and kind and made sure I knew it was *just* catching up, if he invited that ex-or any other ex- to our wedding? I'd say don't or it's over. Because my wedding day would be filled with dread. Any time he looked at or spoke to her, I'd be feeling myself die a little inside. I'd feel like I was watching my marriage die just as it was just starting. It might be an insecure view, but I can't deny the trauma I was put through.


I don't think the OP was intentionally an asshole, but I think he was one. This is his future wife. His life partner. And she gets *no* say in whether or not an ex is there? I understand it's a contingency for his friend, but come on. The fiancee could have been cheated on before with an old partner's ex. Even if not, OP found her attractive at at least one point in time. Would you want someone at your wedding your future spouse has fucked? Would you want to have the idea that they might be reliving the ""glory days"" during your vows? Maybe it doesn't bother everyone, but from my (very personal) point of view, I couldn't imagine it.",AmItheAsshole

Porn consumers don't tend to be picky, or look for ethical porn specifically. I dated a porn addict (watched it all day and masturbated to the point where he had friction burns/scabs and his dick was numb--he hated sex because it didn't feel like his hand and he developed porn induced ED, and now only dates asexual women who don't mind his consumption) it ruined my relationship. He stopped seeing me as a person. He told me flat out he didn't see me as a person because of his porn habits, I was an object to jerk off to. And that's what mainstream porn wants to sell: an object, a product. It killed every little bit of myself I liked, slowly, in a torturous fashion.

There are absolutely ethical ways to support sex work, but the industry as a whole needs to be rebuilt. What's an addict going to look for: an ethically sourced, healthy depiction on an ethical website? Or the quick and easy url? Because I can tell you from my experience: pornhub is an easy address to remember. I swore off porn (because of the nature of the mainstream industry) and entered into a relationship with a man who had done so as well. We didn't like the conditions or what it did to people. 

So yes, sex work can be--and is, at times--ethical. But I wouldn't blame people who say don't consume the product when 90% of the mainstream means are cruel.",unpopularopinion

Then, COVID hit. Then I got switched to a harder, worse paying job because mine didn't exist anymore. And then I had to have major surgery at 25 because one of my organs decided it didn't like me, and my savings were gone. Fuck 2020.",AskReddit

I'm biracial (half Native/half Caucasian) and he didn't like my Native features. According to him, they made me look like a man, and I was a very ugly girl who was lucky to even be around him. I believed that for a long time. The depression made me unapproachable,  so no one else really complimented me. 

Someone pointed out that they liked my eyes, and I started liking them too, slowly. That's why I always start with the eyes. Once I liked my eyes, I started liking more things about myself. Once I had left and built my confidence back up, people started approaching me. 

Force yourself to think of one thing you like about you. Physical, personality, or anything. It might be hard, but focus on it. Think about why you like it. And focus on things that make you happy. Family, friends, or pets, hobbies, like video games or walking in parks, and things you want to do. Do those things. Love those things. Take care of yourself.

When I left, I still loved him, deeply, and felt like a part of me had died. I took a little while to be by myself, but it was just depressing. I started hanging out with friends more, and putting time into experiences I wanted that I couldn't have with my ex. If there are things you wanted to do that she didn't, now's the time to live those experiences out.

I went to concerts, escape rooms, spent time with my family (he hated them), a theme park, trips with my friends, etc. I even made new friends. Eventually, I had fallen in love with an old friend and he confessed he felt the same. This was a couple of months after my ex and I had broken up.

At first, I was hesitant, flighty, and scared that he would hurt me the same way my ex did. He, however, was insanely kind and understanding, most people have been hurt like this. Most people can understand this hurt. Eventually, when I came around, things got even better.

Our first date was an accident. My boss of 3 years invited me to play minigolf to celebrate my promotion, and we each assumed the other person would invite more people. He invited one, but forgot to give him the address. We still decided to play even though it was just the two of us. The place was in disrepair, and there were empty wasp nests all over. One of the holes involved a tunnel, and he stretched up to poke it with his club while I was repeatedly telling him it was a bad idea. About ten, now angry wasps exited the nest, he dropped his club and ran in the other direction. I watched him run across a little bridge (he's 6'0"" and like 170, not a small dude) and it was such a ridiculous sight. I instantly realized I was falling for him.

Two months later, I dyed my hair not knowing it was his favorite color, and he acted really weird around me for the whole day. I thought he thought it was hideous. We went to a mutual friend's house to get drunk and play board games, and when he went into the bathroom I broke down crying. I confessed to the mutual friend everything I was feeling.

username#00636,post,2023-08-21 15:09:11,YSK when searching for help with schizophrenia for someone else or yourself look for first-episode psychosis centers serving your county,"Why YSK: So basically there are places called First-Episode Psychosis Centers that will help people with psychosis get treatment and you get a lot of staff working for you which is great, but there are some requirements. First off I'd like to state that these places are supposed to be free so do not worry about the money. While the requirements differ from place to place, I will give you the requirements for the On My Way program as an example which is in Pennsylvania and is always expanding to new counties. The first requirement is that you be in the age range of 15 to 30 because that is when the large majority of people go through their first episode of psychosis and you will find this is common across these programs. The second is that you be on Medicare which all people with schizophrenia can be on and if you want to set it to be a secondary insurance, this is done because Medicaid will pay for them for treating you and is how they get their costs reimbursed. I believe you also have to live in the counties they serve which is usually multiple but I am not certain about this because it may vary from program to program. There is also a limit as to when you have had your first episode of psychosis first is usually a year or something close to that. Sometimes there are more requirements but those are the big ones. There are websites you can use to find the programs near you like Find A Center - HeadsUp (headsup-pa.org) or national ones like [ but do note these list the nonprofits and some of the counties they serve but nowhere near all of them, so if they are in your region search up their website and check the counties they serve.
  

  
What you get depends on the program but for the On My Way program you get a therapist you meet with every week, and a case manager, medication provider, peer specialist, and resource person that you meet with biweekly. They all make plans and goals for you to achieve with them and work towards a complete recovery. The main program lasts for two years from when you start with them and then you go into a step-down program where you meet with everyone less often and that lasts till you get out of the age range that the program goes to, which in this case is 30.
  

  
It is an excellent option for anyone who needs treatment but is also very reliable compared to other programs since they are usually packed. I know I had a tough time finding treatment for schizophrenia so knowing about this would be a miracle.",YouShouldKnow

Unfortunately for the vast majority of that time I didn't focus on weight training or protein intake, just plain CICO with some cardio.

I recently decided to dramatically up my protein intake. Yesterday I ate 184 grams of protein. My fiance was horrified, and started Googling and pointing me to all kinds of links stating that a woman only needs 46 grams of protein per day or whatever, and more is dangerous for you.

I read on here all the time that you should get at LEAST 100 grams of protein per day, more if you're active, losing weight, or strength training (I do a fair amount of cardio, am still losing weight, and I haven't started yet because they haven't arrived in the mail yet, but I've ordered kettlebells and will soon be beginning the Simple and Sinister program).

I've never been religious. Didn't grow up in the Church, atheist parents, little to no interest in the subject until recently. 

I started hearing angelic and demonic voices back in November - primarily angels at first, then progressively more and more demonic as time went on. I felt and experienced God on numerous occasions. The voices led me to take an interest in Christianity for the first time in my life and I ordered a copy of the New Testament online.

Last night at work I had... an experience. Saint Michael began communicating with me and I saw a flash of light. He told me that I was protected from evil. He told me that the demons couldn't reach me and I just need to have faith. He dictated several pages to me (which he told me to record). Other angels were present too, but Saint Michael was the dominant force.

Is this possible? Or am I just crazy?

MILESTONES!!

Reached my goal weight today! I weighed 134.6 lbs this morning (61.05 kg). My goal was 135 lb (61.24). 

Tomorrow will be 6 months sober from alcohol. Not sure exactly how long I've gone sober from weed now but a bit longer than that - about 6.5 months (I was never a HUGE pot smoker whereas I was a giant alcoholic - that was definitely my real problem, and is therefore the one I really paid attention to and have been tracking).

I had a rough day yesterday. I got an extra hour of sleep and ate more than usual yet was still DEAD TIRED all day (until it came to bedtime, when I was wide awake and suddenly had energy...) so getting in my exercise felt like moving the earth and heavens. 

Still got my 10k steps on the walking pad before noon, still did my 45 min of stationary biking (and by some miracle absolutely SMASHED my previous personal record!), still did day 8 of [Nick-E.com]( beginner's calisthenics routine, although I did not start with the kettlebells when I told myself I would for about the fifth day in a row. I excuse that by telling myself a) I did everything else despite being exhausted, b) I spent most of the day reading my kettlebell book, Simple and Sinister, so at least I devoted a lot of time to the theory, and c) I learned that I'm really meant to have chalk for my hands when using kettlebells so I ordered some off Amazon. 

Today I weighed 136.6 pounds, down from my previous low of 137.0 (61.96 kg from 62.14). That means that I've lost exactly 77 pounds, or 34.93 kg. Well over half my current bodyweight. Feeling good about that.",loseit
username#00643,comment,2024-06-15 15:30:34,,"I lost my first 50 or so pounds by counting calories roughly but without using a tracking app (by eating prepackaged foods like salads).

Now I'm getting a healthy amount of both according to my app.

Tracking has been a lifesaver in that it's also shown me that I really needed to up my protein and fiber intake, helped me stay under 20 net carbs (I'm on keto), helped me track micronutrients other than electrolytes, etc. Yes, I managed to lose 50 lbs without it, but I was really playing around in the dark.",loseit

Some highly unexpected weight loss overnight - 138.2 lb to 137.4 lb (62.69 kg to 62.32 kg). New low. I'll take it! 

Went to the store yesterday at 6:50 am to get there for their 7 am opening time to buy Greek yogurt. Had it with breakfast to help with my digestive issues (definitely did help and I stayed under 20 g carbs even with the 6 from the yogurt). I got over 3k steps from that and another 1k-odd from puttering around the house in the morning, so I had 4400-ish by the time I got on the walking pad around 9 am and walked up to 10k. I ended the day around 10500 but only because I forgot to put my smartwatch which tracks my steps back on after charging it while walking to buy and mail a Father's Day card downtown or I'd have had more like 14000. 

Yesterday I posted that on Tuesday I had a new personal distance record (in 45 min at the same resistance I've been going at for a while) on the stationary bike. Well, yesterday, just the next day, I topped it with a \*NEW\* PR! Feeling great about that. 

My assisted pushups seem to be coming along. I feel the burn in my muscles and it seems like they're getting a little easier even though I've only been doing them for four days. 

My second kettlebell (26 lb - 12 kg) came yesterday. I haven't started doing anything with them yet. Maybe today!

username#00643,comment,2024-06-12 15:02:51,,"My weight problem was due to alcoholism, not food. Last time I relapsed was St Patrick's Day 2023. I was hanging around with fellow alcoholics and figured I'd party with them for the day and have fun, you know, a one-off. A day turned into a week turned into a month turned into a nine month bender with maybe one day off of morning til bedtime boozing. 

I weighed about 148 lbs at 5'8 (f) at the beginning. By December 19, 2023, when I got sober (this time hopefully for good), I weighed 213.6 lbs. This morning the scale said 138.2. 

Why do I think my sobriety will be permanent this time after so many relapses in my past? 

First of all, I've been using booze as a coping mechanism against my schizophrenia symptoms for years now, and for the first time I'm finally on a combination of antipsychotics that works. I no longer feel the need to drown out voices or tamp down fear and anxiety from delusions with alcohol. 

Second, I'm now engaged to a wonderful, supportive man who has had his own struggles with both mental health and alcoholism and not only understands mine but has seen similar success with his own (he got sober just a month and two days after I did). 

Finally, I've had more success already than I've ever seen in the past. I've now been sober longer than I've ever been since I started really drinking (aside from a time or two in high school) at age 18 during my freshman year of university when I picked up the bottle and never really put it down again, I'm actually tracking my calories, weighing my food, paying attention to my macros, making sure I get enough water, etc, I'm actually exercising this time around (which I never have before) and have grown to love it and look forward to it,  and I'm the thinnest I've been in my adult life by about 10 lbs. 

I have zero alcohol cravings anymore. I don't even think about booze. I don't even want a non-alcoholic beer. I used to drink 12+ PBR tallboys a day, every day. I just... Stopped caring about alcohol and started caring about myself and my health and the amazing sober life I'm going to have with my future husband.",loseit
username#00643,comment,2024-06-12 09:38:55,,"Hello Europe! 

New low weight today - 138.2 lb, down from 138.8 lb (62.69 kg down from 62.96). 

Since I last posted here, my standing desk came, so I've been using my laptop while walking on my walking pad to get at least 10k steps a day. A few days have been just about 10k while others have been more like 13k or 14k. It's been great to have especially as the weather hasn't been so nice (mostly cold and rainy, although we're about to transition into Too Hot and it'll be great for that too). 

I picked up a beginner's calisthenics routine I found at [Nick-E.com]( - I've done the first three days so far, although I couldn't really complete day 3 in its entirety because it involved reverse pushups which you need to put your body weight on your elbows for, and my right elbow is still messed up from the infected cat bites (a whooole different story), but I've been doing the pushups - assisted, I feel compelled to add, as I'm quite far from being able to do a floor pushup. 

Had a personal best stationary bike session yesterday which I feel quite good about! 

Today before breakfast I plan to run to the store and pick up some Greek yogurt as I've been having some digestive issues which a nurse recommended it for when I called the clinic yesterday. I think it should fit into my keto diet just fine since I usually sit at about 10-12 carbs daily.

Quitting drinking was the change that made it all happen for me. I was a massive alcoholic . The 12+ PBR tallboys every day was where all the weight came from, not so much a bad diet foodwise (if anything, I undereat, which I guess is still a bad diet, but I've been working on hitting my calories, macros, and micronutrients with the paid version of Cronometer). The day I got sober (December 19, 2023), I started eating keto as well. In January more great changes came along when I got on the right meds for my schizophrenia and started exercising and taking care of myself in other ways.

I got sober and the weight just dropped off. I'm not much of a big eater (all the weight was from 12+ PBR tallboys a day, every day) so once I quit drinking, portion control wasn't hard for me. I like healthy foods. I discovered that I like exercise. I started eating keto and found that I like that too. My agoraphobia is gone so I can go for long walks around town now. I'm no longer spending $400 a month on beer, so I use spend that money for workout equipment and supplements (I'm on disability and get EBT for food, although I've been searching for a full time job for months now that I'm doing so much better - turns out it's hard to secure employment when you haven't worked in years).

username#00643,comment,2024-06-07 10:51:22,,"I'm at almost 75 pounds lost (74.8 this morning).

The biggest factors for me have been 

-Getting sober from alcohol. I've gone through periods of binging on food in my life (mostly when I was a teenager and in university; I'm almost 36 now), but honestly these days I'm not a big eater anymore and by far my main reason for weight gain was insane alcohol consumption. I've been an alcoholic since age 18. Pretty much picked the bottle up my freshman year of university and never put it down. I finally took a hard look at myself and my drinking at the end of last year with the help of my very supportive then-boyfriend, now-fiance, and quit for good on December 19, 2023. I dropped over 22 pounds the first month. My partner, who was also a heavy drinker, quit in January and we've made a commitment to each other to stay sober.

-Getting my mental health under control. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2017 and suffered for years with constant insulting, threatening, disturbing, loud voices, frightening delusions, and crippling agoraphobia. In January 2024, I started Caplyta, my fourteenth antipsychotic after trying thirteen others in countless combinations, along with Haldol, which I've been on for years. Caplyta turned out to be my miracle drug! It totally turned my life around. After three weeks on it, my delusions were gone, my once-overpowering voices were dim background noise, and my agoraphobia was no more! I  started exercising and found it much easier to focus on my physical health issues once my mental health issues were addressed. Once again, my fiance has been incredibly supportive here. He deals with his own mental health struggles and understands what it's like to have a difficult and heavily stigmatized mental illness, so he's always been by my side and has been one of my biggest champions and cheerleaders in my fight against schizophrenia. 

-Last, just a little mundane one. I only weighed myself monthly (on the 19th of every month, the anniversary of my sobriety) up until I reached about 155 lbs, but since then I've been weighing myself daily or near-daily. I like to come up with at least one logical reason every day before stepping on the scale why the number might be a little higher than yesterday, to keep myself grounded in case it is. It's usually lower anyway, but doing this ensures that I'm not too disappointed if it isn't.",loseit

Yesterday's adventure was chia seeds. I was reading about how they're great for fiber, even on a keto diet, so I bought some off Amazon... then decided that I wanted some right away, so when I went to the store for an ice coffee and to restock my chicken breasts, I bought a package of them there as well. When I got home, I poured my coffee into a thermos and stirred a serving of the chia seeds (three tbsp) into it, and drank it up. Not bad. Looked in the bottom of the thermos... okay, 90% of the seeds were still clumped at the bottom. So I poured some water in, stirred again, and chugged down the clumps. Not the greatest experience, but not utterly disgusting either. Worth it for 10 g of fiber in only 150 calories I guess. I'll be incorporating these weird little guys  into my diet from now on.

The past five years or so I've been in a cycle of drinking until I get way too fat to stand it, quitting for a period of time, losing some of the weight, then going right back to drinking and ballooning up again. Very unhealthy. So what makes me think this time is different? 

I've made it longer than I ever have before, by at least a month and a half. I started out fatter than I've ever gotten before (213.6 lb, I believe my next highest was about 200 lb) and I'm now lighter by about eight pounds than I've ever been in my adult life or probably since I was about fourteen (147.2 was my next lowest I think; I weighed in at 139.2 this morning). 

Here are the REALLY important parts though: my psychiatrist and I have found a combination of antipsychotics (Caplyta and Haldol) which REALLY works for me and has completely changed my life, making me feel like my need for booze to cope with my symptoms is totally eliminated. I'm a totally different person now. Schizophrenia no longer rules my life. I'm looking for a full time job and trying to get off disability after not having worked for 4.5 years. I have a supportive and wonderful fiance who also struggled with alcoholism and quit a month after I did, and we both intend to make the change lifelong as we're both doing much better mentally and physically sober. And finally, this time around, I've incorporated exercise for the first time, which I'm loving! I've been biking on my stationary bike nearly every single day for at least 45 minutes since early January, added walking at least 10k steps a day about a month and a half ago, and am waiting on my new kettlebells to arrive so I can start the Simple and Sinister program!

Anyone got a reputable source showing that 100 g minimum is important and more is better? Would be appreciated. I may end up making a thread about this...

Anyway, my infected cat bites were getting worse despite taking my antibiotics as prescribed, so I called my primary care provider's office and they said to come in. I saw a nurse practitioner (not my regular doctor) who prescribed five more days of the amoxicillin I've been taking, for a total of ten, as well as ten days of a second antibiotic. I took my first dose of the new antibiotic last night and, on waking up this morning, I swear it's already helped a little! I did basically take a rest day and didn't bike on my stationary bike or get many steps (\~7k) though.

I'm actually back in the States after getting to London Heathrow at 2 pm GMT yesterday and arriving  home at 6 am GMT this morning. Had a terrific fifteen days with my partner - I MEAN FIANCE - he proposed two days ago in London! I mean, it wasn't exactly a surprise, as part of the reason I went over was to give official notice at the registry office of our intent to marry, but he did a real proposal with the ring and getting down on one knee and everything! So now we're officially officially engaged and I'm over the moon. I love this man so much. 

Amazingly, upon weighing myself on my own scale at home, I found that I'd LOST three pounds since leaving for the UK on the 16th (145.2 - 142.2 lb so 65.86 - 64.2 kg). I was certain I'd have like 10 lb at least of water weight to lose and a few lb of fat after not sticking strictly to keto plus just eating a lot for two weeks! So that was a happy surprise. Maybe had something to do with all the walking we did - over 25k steps on Wednesday, for example, over 20k yesterday, etc. 

I plan to make June a fitness extravaganza for myself. I'll be switching up my diet to really focus on hitting my protein goals, which means more chicken breasts and collagen/protein powder and peanut butter shakes (will buy blender today). I'll be buying a walking pad and standing desk so I can get more steps in just by existing at my computer (won't be cutting out outdoor walks though, gotta get that vitamin D!), kettlebells for strength training, and iron and omega 3 supplements as well as reupping on my multivitamins which I ran out of.

Day eleven of my trip to the UK to visit my partner. Hard to believe I leave on Friday. 

Yesterday we went for a long walk to Aldi to stock up on food supplies and a few basics for the house like TP and cleaning spray. Ended the day around 18k steps. Not a personal record or anything but I'm quite satisfied. About 650 calories burned. 

Had a salad for lunch and green Thai curry with chicken and another salad for dinner. Very delicious. 

Sleep was... Not good. We knew it wouldn't be as we had planned on staying up to watch that new Civil War movie (about a civil war breaking out in the modern US) until it dropped on Amazon Prime at midnight, which we did. Chilling movie to see as an American! It was about 2:30 am by the time we finished watching and we were both wide awake. Had stuff to get up for in the morning even though it's a bank holiday here in the UK (in the States too) so we were kind of torn between trying to sleep or just staying up all night and powering through. My partner ended up sleeping from about 3:30 am until 6:30 and me from 5:30 until 7:30. We each just had a coffee. Oof. Gonna be a rough day. Here's hoping we make it through and get an early bedtime tonight lol.",loseit

Got in about 15,980 steps, fewer than previous days but that was to be expected as I couldn't just pace all day as my partner was working. We did take the dogs for a walk and spent some time outside because it was a nice, warm day. I think it's meant to rain today.

Day eight of my UK trip to visit my partner. I can't believe there's less than a week left! 

Beat my previous day's steps (18900) yesterday with just under 21k and remembered to charge my smartwatch last night so yay for that. I probably won't get quite as many today because my partner isn't working so I can't just pace around the house all day, although we'll most likely be fairly active. 889 so far at 9 am. 

We had burger bowls for dinner - they were AMAZING. Compliments to the chef (my partner)! Probably less calorific than the chicken in pesto/heavy cream sauce that we had the night before, although I did have the leftovers of that for lunch (skipped breakfast). Probably burger bowl leftovers for lunch today and I think my boyfriend is going to bike to the butcher for something for dinner although we also have chicken and sea bass left. 

We weighed ourselves this morning - I weighed 66.35 kg, so 146.2 lb. A pound over my low weight from home, but at least a pound less than I weighed the other day on the same scale (again clothed rather than naked but this time without taking my meds first). I'm REALLY curious to see what I weigh on my home scale under normal conditions when I get back.

Checking in from my seventh out of fourteen days in the UK visiting my partner. Yesterday we had a LOT of food, including a delicious chicken and vegetable dish with an amazing but very calorific pesto and heavy cream sauce for dinner. Worth it. I got like 19,800 steps mostly from just walking around the house while my partner worked (from home, but it's not like we could really hang out while he was in meetings and stuff - thankfully he's off most of next week). 

We had a nice evening hanging out over dinner and then I watched him play the new Hellblade game on the big screen in the lounge which I'm pretty into as I have (diagnosed) schizophrenia and the main character of the game, Senua, has psychosis and hears voices as well. Definitely didn't get enough sleep or drink enough water. Some things to work on for today. We're thinking stuffed peppers with ground beef and Gruyere for dinner tonight. So far I've had a double cappuccino, black, and nearly a liter of water, no breakfast, and gotten 4k steps. 8 am here.

I weighed myself this morning despite saying that I wouldn't until I got home to the States and I was up over two pounds. Could be the different scale and definitely was partly the fact that I weighed myself clothed when I usually weigh naked (and had taken my meds with a gulp of water when I always weigh myself before meds) - I suspect it's a combination of those things plus that I've been eating a bit too much of my partner's amazing cooking and not sticking strictly keto (we've been making an effort but things like kimchi and Sriracha have been making an appearance). Not too worried about it though. I'm here to enjoy myself. 

I'm over my cold now (allergies remain) and apart from the first day I got it and the day I flew over (a week ago today!), I've made my 10k step goal every day. So far today (5:25 pm) up to 18314 steps. I've been managing at least 15k most days. So feeling good about that.",loseit

I'm from the States, but currently visiting my fiance in the UK for two weeks so I figure it's ok to post here. 

I've decided not to monitor my weight at all during the trip (I left Thursday and arrived Friday morning) and to be more lax about my diet (I usually do keto OMAD). I've definitely been eating more and not-so-keto (including a three course dinner with gelato for dessert on Saturday haha), but I don't feel too bad about it because my fiance's parents, whom I'd never met before, described me as ""skinny,"" and my fiance himself, whom I hadn't seen in person since late November, has told me that I shouldn't lose much more weight at all and should instead just focus on toning up. I HAVE been getting my exercise on most days with at least 13-15k steps. 

Unfortunately, I haven't been sleeping well at all since I left the States. Couldn't sleep on the redeye over, couldn't sleep well any of the three nights I've been here so far. My body has been terribly, terribly sore since at least Saturday to the point where even walking down the three small steps from the terrace is excruciating. I'd put it down to exercising again after nearly a full day cramped up in airports and planes, but on waking up today I have flu-like symptoms - stuffed up nose, sore throat, headache. No fever I don't believe, at least. I wore a mask on the plane but I was about the only one who did. I'm up to date on my flu and covid shots at least. Here's hoping this doesn't last long and I don't get anybody else sick...

Anyway, its noon and so far I've had a few mini pickles, a few olives, and a few cocktail sausages along with two liters of water, a cup of tea, and some sort of hot drink for sick people they've got in England. I've been catching up on sleep since about 8 and have gotten four extra hours or so.so that's good but I doubt I'll get any exercise today. 

Hope y'all are doing better than I am!

I also have schizophrenia and drank to cope (I'm actually a mod over at r/schizophrenia and if you scroll through my post history I talk a lot about my alcohol abuse). I quit drinking at the end of last year, finally found a combo of antipsychotics that worked really well for me (Haldol + Caplyta), started eating keto and doing OMAD, and eventually took up exercise (bought a stationary bike at the beginning of January which I work out on for 45 min 7 days a week and just a week and a half ago started walking a minimum of 10k steps a day - I did 22k yesterday). I've lost 67.6 pounds so far. You can do it!

What meds, if any, are you on for your schizophrenia? Do they work well for you; ie, is your mental health under control? Do they cause weight gain? If the answer to the last question is yes, you could talk to your psychiatrist about Metformin or Topamax. 

Your mental health is just as important as your physical health, if not more so. I urge you to quit drinking for the sake of both (if you haven't already done so). This will be a lot easier if you're on medication which does a good job of managing your symptoms.

I know it sucks feeling like you're weighed down under the burden of so much stress with your mental health and your weight and the judgement of other people and there's just so much to overcome but I really believe in you. You CAN make this happen. Every day from today forward CAN be a step in the right direction.

username#00643,comment,2024-05-06 09:33:03,,"For me it was when my boyfriend (now fiance) from England visited me in the States last year. I was a massive alcoholic and drank every day during the visit, getting absolutely hammered, (as I had been for nine months straight), wasting all my money on booze. I have (diagnosed) schizophrenia and always used booze as a crutch because getting drunk would quiet the voices and numb my anxieties and fears about my delusions, but after he left I realized that towards the end of the trip I hadn't wanted him to see me naked, my skin looked terrible, none of my clothes were fitting anymore, and I was bigger than I had ever been. It took about three weeks after his departure for me to get my act together and quit drinking for good. I weighed myself the next day. 213. 6 at 5'8/f. I figured I might as well start eating healthy too to help drop the weight. I've never been a big eater, even drunk, so portion control wasn't hard for me (the weight was ALLLLLL beer weight - I lost 22.4 pounds my first month), but I immediately switched to eating keto, which I've been sticking to and loving ever since.

The next big changes came about a month later when first, my psychiatrist found an antipsychotic that finally worked REALLY well for me (Caplyta), the fourteenth one I've tried since my diagnosis. I'm now on that and Haldol and it's made a world of difference. I no longer crave alcohol because the meds are doing what it once did for me. My voices are just dull, faint, background noises, my delusions no longer rule my life, my agoraphobia is gone, and I'm generally doing so much better that I'm trying to get a job and get off disability (which I've been on for 4.5 years). Second, I bought a stationary bike off Amazon for $200 and I work out on it every day, seven days a week, for 45 minutes. 

Finally, just two days ago, I decided to add walking to my routine in addition to the biking, and I've done over 10k steps both May 4 and 5, which I plan to continue every day. Before the Caplyta I NEVER would have had the courage to go for hour and a half long walks solo outside. That med really changed my life. I was never that super hyped on the stationary biking (although I'm proud of myself for my consistency over the months and I'm going to continue doing it) but I really see why people love exercise now! I feel great after coming back from a walk!

The post-psychosis depression is REAL and anhedonia can make it difficult to do basic things like keeping up with personal hygiene, never mind losing weight.

&#x200B;

Each ingredient on its own would be innocuous. Together, they raise many an eyebrow.

The bark of the dogwood tree, when steeped with water mixed with the mentha plant (mint), produces a simple sleeping draft.

Fae ears, when ground into a powder and mixed into a base such as water, counteracts many poisons. The fae, known for their regenerative properties, have agreed to remove their own ears for humankind's benefit as almost no harm to themselves - for this, we are gracious. With their ears being grown botanically, Brett could make a pretty penny.

Newt eyes make a potion more potent. For example, turning a dream-inducing potion into a hallucination-inducing one. 

Dragon blood is highly sought-after for its powers of negation. For example, it can produce antidotes from poisons, or flame-quenching liquids out of fire-starters.

&#x200B;

Now, imagine this . . .

Dogwood steeped in mintwater. Combine the resulting sleeping draft with the vitreous humor of newt eyes. In another vessel, powderize fae ears, then mix in a dash of dragon blood. Finally, mix the now-coma-inducing potion with the now-poisoning paste.

Any potionsmaster would be able to deduce this in minutes. The concoction would surely get Brett expelled.",WritingPrompts
username#00645,comment,2022-05-13 01:14:11,,"""What?"" Brett snorted. ""There must be some mistake!""

The man in front of him sighed. ""Do you know of the *Magical Purity Act*?""

Brett shook his head ""I don't recall.""

""It disallows all beings that have practiced dark magic from entering our realm.""

Brett furrowed his brow. ""I've never practiced dark magic.""

""*You*, in particular, may have not, but . . . "" the man waved his hand, and a white transparent screen appeared in front of him. ""But a previous life of yours did."" He swiped up on the screen, and it flipped around so Brett could read it.

Brett read off the list of past lives. ""Alistair Gaveston, John Clark . . . Scott Quinn, *tainted*?""

""That's the one."" The man said.

""So *I'm* held accountable for something *they* did?""

""Well, our systems treat every life of an individual as one whole being.""

Brett breathed a heavy sigh. ""So where can I go?""

The man tapped the screen, and it shifted to display a list of realms. ""The ones in green are what you're eligible for.""

Brett's gaze scanned the list. ""There's not that many . . .""

""We're not the only ones who have laws against dark magic."" the clerk explained.

""Hm!"" Brett pondered each realm.

*Thoros*? Too bland. Brett wanted a world he would enjoy.

Zhahesk? In a world of geniuses and visionaries, he would be an idiot.

*Vilthu*? A hell of eternal torture. A solid pass!

But Brett couldn't just walk the endless white halls of Limbo forever. One option faced him.

""What about reincarnating again?""

The clerk sucked his teeth. ""You *will* run out of tries if you keep making mistakes like this.""

""I don't care. Spin the wheel.""

The clerk bowed his head and snapped his fingers. A slot machine appeared nearby. It spun for a few seconds until it stopped on a name, home-world, a time period.

""You next life's name is Xuvir, from the same planet you're from, Gelena - but you're a few thousand years ahead, in the year 3025. Your world of vibrant magic has become a tomb of cold metal.""

""How many resurrections do I have on this life?""

""Two,"" the clerk answered. ""Make them count."" He snapped his fingers, and Brett dissolved into light. Two more lives to set things right.",WritingPrompts

username#00647,post,2022-08-07 15:18:45,"Keep Breathing' 2022 is a great limited series, just advertised to the wrong audience","(minimal spoilers, next to none) 

I just finished the series, literally balling my eyes out as if I've been whipped. Then I went online and saw that so many people ""skipped the flashbacks"" and were bummed by ""how little actual survival"" the series is about. Saying it was a horrible show. I'm baffled.

Short summary: Plane crashes and lady has to survive in nature.

Netflix advertised it as a survival thriller, but in reality, it's a constant back and forth between her past life, desires and current survival. The survival is more like a methaphore for overcoming trauma and in no way a hardcore violent, gory survival thriller. I can imagine you are disappointed if that's what you're hoping for. 

Yes, some of the nature things she experiences, she handles a bit too well, but the story is really about overcoming trauma and the whole point was not to show her diarrhea by a tree, like with some movies.

It was heart wrenching, romantic and sweet. About life, death and love.

I believe this is a real bummer for Netflix with how it has been advertised, and I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up like Jennifer's Body, which is a campy horror about surviving sexual assault, and all the ads did was cater to young teen boys who couldn't relate at all to the teenage girl experience the film portrayed. It was hated so much in the media, and now it has gotten a redemption because finally the right audience has caught on.

Tldr: If you wanna watch something about trauma processing, our inner chaos and love, watch Keep Breathing. If you wanna watch a person survive in the wilderness and don't want to bother much with childhood trauma, watch that movie with Daniel Radcliff.",unpopularopinion
username#00647,post,2021-03-03 08:53:39,How do I block my rapist on LinkedIn?,"I'm now an adult woman with a career that is starting to thrive. I made a LinkedIn profile to further that. On LinkedIn you can see whoever looked at your profile. Maybe more than a year ago now, I went to see who'd viewed my profile.

I saw his face, his name and my blood ran cold. It was before lockdown. I was in a lecture at my university. I wanted to puke. I felt so so sick. Even now, the thought of him triggers a horrible panic. I was so young, its been years, but but lingers.

I couldn't help but look at his jobs website, I made an old post about that. Makes me sick to know people trust a child rapist.

But I digress. I felt so sick, I removed my profile picture. He was not allowed to look at me. I felt violated again. How dare he still look me up. We are not in the same field. We have no mutual friends. He just knew my name and wanted to see. I can even imagine it as a power move from his end. He is like that. I don't want him to see me. I don't want to know he's thinking about me. For him to know my professional career made me feel sick. I don't want him to find me. He kept finding me back then, and I was a gullible child who didn't know how to place the feelings. Today, I'm a woman. I know it was not my fault, I know he is to blame and I know I want nothing to do with him.

I've been putting this off. Terrified to try, risking him getting notified I visited his profile. He does not deserve to know how much he hurt me. But I want to live my life still. I want to be able to have a picture on my LinkedIn. I no longer get contacted by headhunters due to the fact my profile is so incomplete. 

Hence I ask: how do I block him without actually entering his profile and letting him know he still haunts me, after all those years and a year after he visited mine?",TooAfraidToAsk
username#00647,post,2020-11-21 20:43:33,I looked up my rapist on Google.,"I was raped by a 20 year old university student when I was 15. Due to me being a ""wild teenager"" (a full virgin though) and him being a ""good, proper student of academia"", and our age of consent in this country, nothing else came of it.

Almost 10 years later, I again Googled him. He is doing so good. He got a nice degree and a really good position at an attractive firm.

They made a little text about him, underneath his picture. He's ""empathic, kind and good at [things] "".. He is, in fact, not empathetic nor kind. He is a rapist of a child. Or at least a young, virginal teenaged girl who was already feeling like she didn't belong.

He raped me. It's no gray zone. He told everybody I regretted it and accused him, when I told a mutual friend. I did not. I still have triggers. What you whispered in my ear when I was laying immobile on your bed, fully conscious with no control of my body. I still feel like I never left your bed.

It was not a gray zone. I remember running to the toilet as soon as I got some control back. I washed my hands with toilet cleaner, I needed to feel clean. I was panicking, you grabbed me and held me while I cried. You wrecked the last hope I had inside.

I'm a person today. But I don't understand. Why will he never be punished for his deeds? I am punished everyday for trusting you. I was so young. So trusting. Worst thing is, I'd probably had sex with you if you waited a couple of weeks. But you didn't want that. You got exactly what you wanted. Not just sex. But total power and control. I still wonder if it was recorded. I don't know. I hope you die. I hope I'll never meet you again. 

I fear sending my child to a kindergarten, seeing you with your wife and child. I fear buying a house, seeing you next door. I fear you, I hate you, how dare you. You are disgusting. You even had the audacity to call me 'your Lolita'. How dare you. I hope you die, I hope you disappear, I wish you never existed. And people say you are a kind and empathetic man. No release will ever come. You will forever be unpunished.",offmychest

username#00647,comment,2024-04-27 14:54:25,,"When I was 19 and I often went out (legal here). I was nice, polite and broke. I'd sometimes straight out ask if I could get a drink from the bottles and sodas/beers some people had on the table, and I wouldnt pretend to be anything I was not just to get it. I just asked. I knew they could afford it and I didn't. A no was also always ok. Some of them offered a drink and and a chat and honestly it was interesting and entertaining to me. Most often not at all erotic, though. Some offered a drink and then go back to theirs, some would almost shoo me away. Thats fine, they were generous and not there to chat with a young girl who was just hoping for alms.

Some of these people where women, some were girls, some were boys. Some others were 40+ aged men. It was sometimes easier to talk to these men because they were less afraid of me than young boys. Ive had lovely chats and met lovely people and seen new horizons. Never fucked an old guy though, never kissed them and never wanted to. But it was nice to have a decent chat with someone with life experience. Also without any drinks, sometimes. Today, I have a bigger budget and I do the same thing. Send drinks along to the next young person whos out scavenging. And I love to be able to be generous now. I think its fine to be of different budgets and asking for accomodation.

Some of these men severely misunderstood what I wanted. Especially as a grown lady who now is on the other end, I find it ridiculous how so many men were so ignorant. Youre probably not sexy to a teenager. Some girls may not have the confidence to be honest and lies to get drinks. It happens. Youre in the ripe age of looking like someone who can afford it.

People will try to overrule, dominate or compete with you, simply because it is a greater win to dominate someone pretty, even if you don't want to compete. Noone will take pity on you. You are considered to have been rewarded something that you know must pay for everyday with other peoples filth thrown at you.

People who believe their troubles in life stem from them being ugly, simply do not understand that its because they're not nice people. They could very well have become like that because of their insecurities from being ugly. But people pity ugly people. People dont fear the strength of ugly people. People dont have a constant need to win over ugly people, because they believe they already have.",ask

But my god, I see the seriousness I their faces, when I teach 13-15 years olds about this when I'm a guest lecturer, and I think it works more to have as a potential punishment than everything else. How many times has it happened? I have no idea, I just know that it exists. And that it helps children stop. I think it much more often hit 16 year old boys when they share revenge porn of their girlfriends. Which I've seen happen. 

Also, it *is* evil to punish children for sexual acts. However, I do think many children, from about the age of 12, do enter puberty with a lot of natural and internal curiosity. Girls bodies change so much from such a young age, and I believe it's not unheard of that some girls might take a picture of it because it's fun, different and exciting. Both cameras and their bodies are very accessible to themselves. Most of the next steps of sharing are often steeped in manipulation though. But we do have to recognize children's curiosity and how that is not evil, disgusting or bad. I believe that teaching children every sexual urge is evil, is just as much of an assault than asking them to share a pic of their body. Of course, direct assault and being an aggressor in many other ways are definitely worse, but I do think we need a balance so they can grow up to be happy adults with a healthy relationship with sexuality.",TrueOffMyChest

It's 'fun', it doesn't feel crazy to me, but I guess its because I grew up as a girl. Just sad and predictable. I was 13 when adult men would begin catcalling me in the streets. They barely do anymore because I am an adult and they know I will fight back. The world is a nasty place. It's not safe, especially not for girls. Different levels of sexual violence hides behind every door honestly. And ask any girl. It's not that everyone had that one moment. It's that we continously experience it. Again and again.

The best defence against sexual violence is open and honest communication, so she knows when people are doing something they're not supposed to. I'd recommend reading up on age-appropriate home sex education if you don't feel comfortable with what is fitting. Studies show solid sex education also leads to a later sexual debut because the teens feel more in line with their own boundaries.

Even though I didn't actually had any directly explicit materials made, I also edged a lot on it, from a very young age. And you know what? Now I'm almost 30, and that need I had for attention is much less, and much more fulfilled by my loving partner. It is the raging hormones that drives it, and it's the addictive feeling of knowing how and where to get it that potentially leads to unfortunate experiences.

Two things I have to point out:
1) this could have been a huge problem about 10 years ago. It was the fall of many girls. But so many young teen girls have been through the ringer at this point that no matter what you do, what you've done is not that special. Many girls have done it before you and you can try to find comfort in the fact that you won't be singled out as you would 10-15 years ago (this is to calm you, not to be negative). Much less social consequences, as everyone knows revenge pron exists and is wrong. That just wasn't a term back then

2) if you are under the age of 18, no matter what age of consent you have in your place of living, what you are producing is by default child pronegraphy (trying to avoid the bots here). Which means you are lucky nothing has happened yet, but you can potentially get a sex offender offence, even though you are the child depicted in the pictures and videos. So consider yourself probably lucky that nothing happened yet and please stop in order to avoid anything severe on your legal records.

username#00647,comment,2023-09-05 12:59:23,,"I think you've experienced too much religious propaganda or similar. In my country, we have really good sex ed, and most of the older teenage girls/young adults/adults are intimately aware of the choices, and we are encouraged to have a good, healthy and consensual sex life. I have never met anyone who actually took the pill each day/had a IUD/used Nuvaring/had that thing they operate into your arm/had the birth control shots AND STILL accidentally got pregnant. Those stories are usually about people who forget a pill, or maybe puke it up or have very severe diarrhea for a week or something. The majority have sex without condoms with our partners in my country. Even those who use hormonal bc, rarely use condoms, but use diaphragms, timing and spemicide etc. Most hormonal birth control is pretty much 100% safe, as long as you take it correctly. I've had unprotected sex for more than a decade now, so have most of my peers, and I've only seen 1 accidental pregnancy, which was someone not using bc (I think it was a broken condom and she got an abortion, so no biggie) . And I've been close to people many people, and had many many friends who's had a ton of sex for more than a decade. No surprise babies.

And if we want to discuss fertility, I can tell you that I'm now in the age where all my friends are intentionally getting pregnant, and none of them have any issues except for one couple who was also very overweight, and then still managed in the end. It's like two weeks off bc's and babies are just shooting out everywhere.

I think the issue is mostly just bad sex ed and limited knowledge. Like, I fucking hate hormonal bc because it's uncomfortable, but I'd 1000 times over be hungry and moody all the time than have a baby.

All the stories about surprise babies is 99,9999% because people fuck up. Like, you have to take a bc pill the same time each day. If you forget a pill, you should probably hold off sex for a week. But other choices are easier. I have a plastic ring i just put inside me, and it releases hormones that creates three barriers of entrance for babies. So if one fails, another will probably succeed. They make a 'slime' blockage at my cervix. This is what happens, too, when you're pregnant, to prevent baby spillage. Semen cannot penetrate that. Then, if it succeeded in the penetration anyway, my uterus is thin and slick, making it hard for an egg to stick, but that's already difficult, as I am neither ovulating, so no eggs. That is what my birth control does. I trust it and I am not scared.",NoStupidQuestions

I remember about 20% after the night but I can see on videos I look fully conscious and very consenting to hugs and cheek kisses and dancing and all that. Very scary. But we must consider this.

Ive also been raped while under the influence. I remember inability to move and the strange feelings of sex, which was also my first time. Extremely traumatic. Not saying OP wasn't raped. He could very well have been. But I'm also saying he might be prone to blackouts with bursts of energy. She's also very young and perhaps she's also somewhat inexperienced and thought it was okay.

Imo, AS AN ADULT in this day and age, I see it's not okay. We are much more conscious about consent today, but when I was 18, I did once had sex with a guy who was under the influence, he was the one initiating everything, and I was dead sober. I don't think he was blacked out, or irresponsibly drunk, but I wouldn't honestly if he blacked out, his friend drove us to his place and we had a conversation throughout the entire ride very fun and pleasent.

It's hard to know what happened and if OP feels bad, he's allowed to. If he doesn't feel violated, we don't have to push that upon him. He should be aware and causious about this person.

Afterwards we talked about it, and agreed that it's funny how incredibly universal love is. For me, I see myself and my partner in every happy romantic relationship I see in media.

I think she might have some internalized homophobia, however, I don't think she's necessarily have any conscious knowledge of this.

A fetus who does not even have awareness of existing isn't a 15 year old, either. People need to stop comparing things which are different. Death is not the same.

Many fetuses needs to die to avoid unhealthy babies, no matter how painful it is to look something you were excited for. The oldest generation will die eventually.

It's actually very normal for some assault victims to experience this. Reason being, assault is the ultimate loss of control which can happen to you without necessily leaving a single physical mark. Many *survivors* will time and time again put themselves in a similar position, in the subconscious hope of reliving it with full control and thus removing the definitive control loss.

HIV is not, but today it's very treatable. It's also less likely to transfer to women, and in general, it's less prominent between straight people. Mostly unlikely you have it, but with the LDR, and your worry, I'd get tested for that.

Generally, you can cure both chlamydia and gonorrhea. You really need to be sure to take the entire treatment of antibiotics, though, exactly like the doctor tells you. Chlamydia is only two pills, at once, though. Not sure about gonorrhea.

Syphilis is treatable, too, I believe. It's pretty 'out of style'. It was the big one in the 1800's, but you rarely see it these days. But you can always get the test to be sure.

STD's is not shameful to have, but it's shameful of you don't take action. I appreciate your reaching out to us and I hope youll get checked out. Either tell your partner now, or don't.

If you guys kissed half asleep, all drunk, and you then took your penis and penetrated her without much thought, and she just kind of laid there, then that seems really bad.

But. I was completely broken at 17. I thought all I had lost would be a pit of grief, disease and jealousy. I just wanted what everybody else had. But healing came with time, and some may have been lost, but time is not gone. You have so much time left, and it can be so much better. I wished I'd never been born so many nights, so many days, but healing came. It got better. I'm almost 27 now, and 10 years ago feels like a distant world. I barely recognize the feelings anymore. I sometimes feel pangs of pain. Jealously. Anger. But now, I generally feel good. I feel okay. Love came. Life came. Your childhood does not have to be your only recourse of life.

I think you may have grown up watching so much porn and kink porn that you have skewed your perception of what's normal. My sister is a generation shift older than me, and she was a teenager before the internet. She has always lived the *sex, drugs and rock and roll* life back then, and she said before the internet got widespread, anal sex was considered a very out-there kink, but as soon as social media really got popular (way before Facebook), then it suddenly became a norm. Because, the more extreme things you will do, the more money you make as a porn star. Anal stuff became so normal because it paid a shitton of money, and suddenly ""everyone does it"". However, in normal society, this is not actually that normal. Many have tried it now because of the porn influence, but it doesn't make it part of a standard sex life.

Personally, I'd much rather pee on you than ever engage in ass play. And I am super into bdsm and go to sex parties. Still, I just don't have any kind of interest in anal play.

I like your ending statements, because it makes me think you are genuine about this. I think it's important you reflect on this, and you are not an asshole at all for wanting these things. However, I don't see any way this will work out in a way where one of you doesn't get badly burned. Either you stay and feel horribly dissatisfied, or you accidentally end up pressuring her to something that might even end up traumatic for her.

sounds like you say you don't want to pressure her, but that you still feel comfortable pressuring her a bit, and that when she didn't comply with moderate pressure, you've given up and is sulking in the fact that 'she doesn't want to do this for you', when in reality, this is not a 'her' thing. This is just sexually incompatibility. On both parts. I'm not saying you're a bad person, but it's definitely a bit problematic that you have this huge issue and that you are growing resentful. The only real option you have is really to either accept it fully or leave her. You can never really let her know that you will leave her if she doesn't comply, as that will be very much a thing that could make her do something she really really does not want to do, which is just not okay, even if that's the honest thing.

I dated someone who was super into everything ass. I wasn't. Sex was fine, but they lacked this. I didn't want to do it, they didn't pressure me. I let them go, to pursue their favorite thing.

You might have seen strange clips on the internet of women touching microphones with feathers while whispering, but that's just one tip of an enormous iceberg.

ASMR is experiencing a physical reaction, something that can look like a non-sexual orgasm, without any need for physical stimulation. If you have the capacity, there's actually full studies in Google Scholar about what it is, but scientists are still a bit mystified. These reactions can be provoked by many different things, and the degrees of sensation can vary. Some people are triggered (for once, this is considered a good trigger) by whispering, some are by watching a video of a doctor physical exam on YouTube, some are by soft spoken words, watching massages, drawings etc. This is kind of like the chills you can get from a particularly great piece of music, or when you have your hair washed at the hair salon.

I belive what you maybe experienced, was an asmr reaction, triggered and amplified by the edibles, which created a state where you hit a borderline drug-induced psychotic state. Even though people might not think of it, weed is one of the number 1 drugs to cause psychosis. You're, like, 1000 times more likely to get psychosis from weed than from Heroin, for example. People devalue the possible danger, as the risk of dying is less. However, psychosis is no joke. But a good deal of those who'll end up with a psychotic episode from weed, most often won't have lasting damage.

I bring up psychosis, as you say the effects took place a period of time even after the end of use. This looks quite obvious to me, that you had a borderline psychedelic experience which caused an autonomous sensory meridian response (amsr) but also unfortunately induced a psychotic state where your autonomous sensory meridian responses went wild as your brain was in overdrive.

Besides the initial infatuation you can get with a crush, what I found to be men who hold back a little first, that are more genuine. I am just full in there, but my current, soon-to-be decade long relationship of love and mutual respect was actually grounded in us both pursuing each other, but still not going too much into it (I probably went feet first lol), but I felt him slowly but surely loving me more each day, each month each year. A very intense love from the beginning is rarely a good omen. You can have very intense experiences of course, but giving into each other fully and healthily comes with time.

I have been love - bombed before and it feels amazing until it doesn't. With my current partner, I spend a year dreading how much he really wanted this. Liek, we were exclusive and in a relationship after a few months of dating, but he was still getting to know me. Of course you shouldn't ever settle for a man who doesn't know whether he want to or not, but this was a healthy way - we liked each other, but love grew naturally as we got to know each other. And we have our own lives and our mutual life. We are faithful and monogamous, but we are also independent in ideas, lives and interests. We can affect each other, but we don't control each other. That's how it's supposed to be, imo.

We also do kinky role play lol, but in our usual lives, he does not get to decide anything that just involves me. He can ask and say and affect me, but he cannot be angry if I don't adhere, unless of course it's about general rules of monogamy, which we have agreed upon and adhere to.",offmychest

There's not actually access up there when you're just hanging out, it's only when a woman is turned on it expands, and even then it doesn't just leave a nose-like entrance up there. Additionally, if you have unprotected sex, the man has to be incredibly dehydrated to the point of nearly having solid ejaculate, if it is gonna stay up there anytime. When a woman sits up post-coitus, the semen will flow out naturally. And as peeing after sex is encouraged, usually the semen is generally expelled there, too.

You say you regularly go to the doctor. How recently have you been there last? Were you checked for vaginosis? I heard that is a real smeller, even though it is not necessarily something that hurts at all. Do you use scented intimate wash? That could make for a bad environment, actually promoting smell. Do you use regular soap? That is way to harsh for a delicate area like that. Do you use the soap on your labia, vulva or in your vagina? You shouldn't let soap actually enter your vagina, it should only be used on the vulva. And lastly, what kind of underwear do you use? Synthetic fabrics promote smells, and for a intimate area with mild/pleasent to no smell, I'd recommend always using cotton underwear or underwear with cotton fabric at the crotch.

username#00647,comment,2022-09-10 06:39:29,,"I'm European, so it's a bit different here. However, try to be honest, and if you have an unpopular opinion, you don't necessarily have to share it with everyone. I think you shouldnt ever be dishonest with yourself, and you should never just be a follower when people are being sexist, racist or bullying, but I learned that giving a bit of leeway and not arguing everything made my life better. My parents are very stubbern and I'd take every discussion when when I was a teen. Doesn't make you popular. It honestly doesn't hurt to try to be a bit palatable if you can do it while not betraying yourself. If someone likes something, don't just be like ""lol that's cringe lol"" or something like that. I did grow up in a different time than you, but back then at least, it was very cool to be ""not like the other girls/boys"", and when I realized it's actually nice to just be okay with liking both non-pop things and pop things, I became a much happier person.

Also, something a great person taught me is always try to listen and ask people more about things they care about. Not an interrogation, but a friendly interest. If you can listen and just ask and be there, people will be so thankful and happy, they'll feel seen and heard. Of course it goes two ways, but being selfless sometimes makes for a happier life. Being there for others makes me feel so much joy. Seeing someone's eyes light up in joy is the greatest feeling ever honestly. 

And the obligatory ""don't feel the need to rush into things, you will get and experience everything eventually"". And as a European, I need to add: try to get comfortable and knowledgeable with sex ed. You're still young but just on the edge. Many start about 15-16 with engaging in intimacy (which is many things, sex is not just one thing), but studies show that the more teens know, the more comfortable they are to wait a bit longer. You can see some videos from Mamma Doctor Jones on YouTube. She makes very good educational videos on everything body. It's important to know stuff and that will also prevent you from having more pain than necessary. Nothing more unfortunate than accidentally knocking up your first girlfriend because you didn't know that touching yourself and then touching her (you know where I mean) can actually transfer semen and with a freak accident suddenly become a life altering thing. You still have time, but hormones are flying and the better informed you are, the better of an experienced it will be for all of you when you finally get to a place where you wanna try out stuff. But don't rush. Listen to her, listen to yourself. Hold hands. Maybe share a kiss. That's is just magical when you're 14, it really was for me hehe.

And if you're super nervous, take a deep breath and don't force things. Some teen boys get so much on their head about giving a girl a little kiss that they don't actually have attention on her anymore. It's a two person thing. A kiss is a thing you share. Closeness is a two person game. If its just you trying to get close to a body, it's not right. Always make sure it's a two way streak. That's also for when you're older, but now when you ask I think it was good to mention.

And last thing, do enjoy it. I have so many fond memories from when I was 14 and first being into someone and having a pretty boy thinking I was pretty. It's so fun and scary and exciting. But it all gets easier. Try to always think, if it's very hard and unbearable, it will pass. Life will go on. And you will be fine again :) even at my hardest times, I was still existing on this planet, and now they seem so distant. Life is a marathon, but it's beautiful.",offmychest

Look this is not just about the birtg control then. I know this feeling all to well, but with time and age, it will become easier. Tell her you care deeply about her, but it would be more comfortable for you to take a few day break every month right now, as you're not having a good time because you're too worried. She needs to respect your boundaries. "" 'no' is a full sentence"", and you're fully allowed to not feel up for sex. No matter the reason. And just because you're a man doesn't mean you have to be up for it 100% of the time. Tell her you just don't really feel safe enough, then. She deserves an honest boyfriend and building trust is also about being honest about comfort level. My boyfriend didn't feel comfortable having sex on my period and I didn't mind, so we just don't. And after some years, he changed his mind, but I don't feel like it these days and he respects that. Then we just have a (penetrative sex) break. And that's okay. You can do many other things that doesn't involve penetrative sex. Maybe do something for her, if you really want to please her but is not feeling comfortable and safe with regular sex. Or don't.

And that's okay, it doesn't make you a bad person, it's a need that all have, to be accepted, and teenagers are generally struggling to seek that out in sensible ways. If you want to do something for her to feel good, write a love letter or buy some flowers (not to massive, and not just bring them to school, bring them to her home), or invite her for ice cream or iced coffee or something. Tell her that you like her around, but the fact that she intentionally make you jealous is not fun for you, and that if she wants your attention, you'd gladly give her without those games.

Honestly, the whole ""it's attractive when you're jealous"" thing sounds to me like an echo from a young adult novel or that ""after we collided"" or whatever the feck it's called, movie about this bad boy having problems controlling his feelings because the main girl makes him wild. When you're a teenage girl you crave this intensity of love and attraction and shes definitely projecting.

Periods, sex, etc. We are supposed to hurt all the time. And we are never good enough and we need to submit. It's scary and we fight for control. She probably does this because she does not feel you close to her, and when she does this, she feels a sense of acceptance of her from you. Your jealousy confirms your interest in her, which makes her feel better. She's not trying to hurt you, she's trying to make you express emotions. If you tried to actually pursue her, she probably wouldn't feel the need to do this. But she's 14 and you're 14 and for the next, at least 5 years, you guys at that age are trying out relationships and romance for the first time and it's a bit of a shit show.

But honestly, to me, it felt more awkward to do childish things as a teenager than as an adult. And if you look anywhere on the internet, it is widely recognized that many millenial adults do a shit ton of childish things and have a great time (like Legos, Disney land, etc).

But what this makes me think of is actually a term in my country called ""Curling Parents"". It's when parents try to sweep away every obstacle from their child and end up with a somewhat inept child who both have depression and anxiety because they have absolutely no idea how to navigate a world with responsibilities. It's really sad and a lot of people are affected by it these days, and their parents parents were *too* strict and didn't let them be a child. It's hard to find the middleground, but children need responsibilities to experience successes and to see they can easily handle it. Honestly, becoming and adult for me was fucking amazing, I can do all the shit I want to and nobody can really tell me no.

Here the other day at work, me and the other adults talked about tamagochis and how bomb they were, and as we have adult money, we all just bought one each and now we have fun playing with toys at work and we're having a fucking party. It's not impossible to keep your play and magic inside alive. And responsibilities are not really a problem when you're used to them.

Every year on my birthday, I ask my parents to prepare a small celebration for us, where we have a fun day, parents cook dinner and my mother makes a cake just how I like it. It's wonderful and magical. Last year, I again watched the Christmas series for children, because my mother said it was bomb and I should, and I enjoyed it a lot and we watched the last episodes together while having a fun Christmas week.

I think about 95% of the things you said are definitely possible when you're an adult. Even more when you stop being a teenager, as being a teenager makes so many things awkward. Are your grandparents dead? Else I don't see why they would not be able to do most of these things if you asked.

I can admit my childhood was pretty shitty, but the specific things you mention are things adults still can engage in.

However, white is purposely vague, so whoevers in charge can choose whoever they deem fit for the tribe. If you think Hispanics are leeches, then you can say they don't fit white. If you are against Afro-Americans, then maybe you can team up with the Hispanics to alienate those of darker complexion.

I don't condone any of this, just to make it clear. I personally have tried to move away from saying ""white"" as it can create a strange awkwardness here where I live, in Europe, because I consider myself white and originally, southern Europeans did not look like what I considered white. It is completely irrelevant however, and grounds in racism.

It's still important to remember when we talk systemic racism in America. But in general, we should stop using the language of white and not white.",NoStupidQuestions

There are levels of sex ed for different ages, but many children will be curious about sex, and many adults will let the child know, in shallow details, what it's actually about. And then children might reenact that in play with dolls, that's normal. 

I pretended to breastfeed my baby dolls when I was little, and alone. I did it a couple of times. My mother gene was already kicking then. Altho it felt kind of off with my tiny child chest, so it got boring and I stopped.",offmychest
username#00647,comment,2022-08-31 18:55:05,,"Well, HIV is almost eraticated in Scandinavia. Syphilis is also pretty much non-existent. When my partner and I stated dating, I told told him to get a full screening before we got intimate, which I in turn did, too. He told me that his doctor had chuckled and asked if he was a 1800's pirat, when he had asked for a syphilis test. 

My country did have a small chlamydia outbreak after covid, but people said they weren't using protection because the lockdown drove them to more risky behavior. But yeah in general, in rich, well-educated countries, STDs aren't a big problem. But they're not a problem ***because*** people are aware of the dangers. Just because car accidents are rare, I wouldn't tell you not to wear a seat belt. I would tell you not to worry, but always drive safe and wear a seat belt. *Because* we are very aware and careful here, and because we have great sex ed, people very rarely get STDs or teen pregnancy. I only ever met one girl who started reproducing in her teen years. I've known a couple of girls who has gotten abortions, but only a very few of them, too.

I'm not saying you should be completely careless, but I'm just stating a medical fact. Yeah shaving is def a risk-enhancer. And the pull-out method is 80% effective when done right. Doesn't mean it's a good idea. I think people should be careful, but both I and many people I know have had rich, adventurous sex lives and I always encourage safe and healthy exploration. The only girl I ever knew to have gotten a bad STD was a friend of mine who went to Morocco and had sex with a stranger there (after this, she of course got treated immediately at home and is very careful now to not contaminate anyone else). But honestly, I think that is where it gets a bit more sketchy. Here in our nice bubble, sex ed is the greatest in the world and we generally do not have much to worry about. But we also are very aware of ways to prevent problems.",TooAfraidToAsk

I am not ignorant, and I live in one of the countries with the lowest HIV rate in the world. The reason it was especially prominent with the gays was because anal sex often causes tears and is transferred, for example, from the penis and semen into the small tears of the anus.

I know you shouldn't rely on chance, but I am extremely well educated in sexual health, and when you are, you know the realistic risks. Doesnt mean you are impenetrable, but so far I have yet to have a single STD nor pregnancy and I've had a lot of sex. Straight sex, queer sex, group sex. And I've always been knowledgeable, aware, careful and as a post-mortem, I've made sure to have regular STD tests.


I think you need to go to Google scholar maybe, read some articles.

It's even well known that you have to be quite unlucky to get HIV immediately if you are having sex with a new person, who coincidentally have hiv. And those who get it the very first time they have sex? Well of course, if you are a girl having sex for the first time, you will definitely have a high risk of tears. More likely than not. And that's how it get you.

That being said, you shouldn't go around spreading HIV, you should make sure to have your STD checks if you have regular sex, and if you're having one night stands, always practice safe sex and try to use common sense when picking a partner. Sure, everybody can be unfortunate, but in progressive countries, transfer is not likely. It's not the 80's.

Additionally, if you are in a high risk area, you can choose to take the drug PReP, then your risk of hiv almost completely subsides.",TooAfraidToAsk

Men generally loves inexperienced girls
Girls loved experienced girls

You should never lie, of course. But what I've experienced is that men think it's particularly titillating for you to accentuate how young and inexperienced you are. Don't play that game with girls. Be honest, but do not expect it to be a turn on.

I've accidentally done it myself and it's not a great reaction. I've in return experienced receiving ""if never been with a  girl before but there's something about you"" and it honestly didn't tickle my pickle either (am lady btw lol).

Some might be into it, though, but as girls generally are harder to satisfy sexually, and men can be a bit predatory creeps, it just doesn't line up the same.

Doesn't mean you should not be honest about your inexperience!! Just don't use it as a tactic. Imo.

And be aware that girls are much more subtle when inviting you for a good lady loving. It once complete flew over my head when a girl wanted me to company her ""picking up her bags to leave the party"". I'd only just arrived like 1 hour earlier, and I didn't feel like leaving already, at all. Her friends kind of elbowed me and I went with it, and in reality she invited me to a couch makeout which.. Could have proceeded if we weren't both on our periods. Hahaha I've experienced that, like, a ridiculous amount of times ""I'm on my period but I'll do whatever you'll like!""

A guy was horrified for me to grab his penis while he was sleeping. I was a teenager and only wanted to be a cool girlfriend. I honestly also did it for him, as I thought it was what he wanted. But I realized that not everybody want that.

But, in this day and age, consent is much more something we talk openly about. And the fact that he didn't ""wake you with sex"", his intentions isn't clear whether he actually wanted to wake you up. And if this was just for personal gratification, that's scary.

3) however. Other people might not have same reaction as you. You were assaulted before and this is very triggering to you, obviously. Doesn't make it okay, but he may just wanted to engage in something and his intentions were perhaps to try to wake you into some sexy time. But have you not talked about your boundaries together? You're having a child together, that's really major.

4)  from your language, I'm a bit unsure.. Did he actually penetrate you, or did he rub up on your butt cheeks? Both are bad, but it does change the situation a bit. Not that any of them are okay.

5) you're having your second child at 20? And is he not living with you?",TrueOffMyChest

As you have never engaged in a physical relationship, how would you know if they were insatiable? Maybe they would be satiated if you engaged in a sexual relationship with them? Not that you have any obligation to, whatsoever, but sex is a natural part of intimacy, and the American puritanical ideas are polluting what can be very lovely and beautiful. Many men has over the years felt unsatisfied when engaging in a solely sexual relationship with a woman, ad they longed for love and companionship, whole women has experienced pure lust and boredom, too.

username#00647,comment,2022-08-07 05:42:04,,"OCD is a very misunderstood illness.

To give you a short rundown. OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder. People think this has to do with order and pensils that line up and stuff, but in reality, it's about obsessions and compulsions, and that can be practically anything.

An example was a young woman who experienced very intense images of physical exploitation of children. Everytime she saw a child, she would have a drive to assault this child. It did not make her sexually excited or turned her on in any way. She was extremely repulsed by the thoughts, but they were very intrusive and she almost felt pain from not engaging. In the end, she had an episode where she fell to her knees screaming ""I'd rather die than touch a child! I'd rather die than touch a child!"" over and over again. She didnt know why this was happening. She got admitted to the psychiatric ward and there she was diagnosed with OCD. She got medicine and all these obsessions and compulsions disappeared. 

Now she lives a normal life. OCD is actually a kind of psychotic illness, where you will get an obsession and you will feel a force from inside to act on it. (there's a documentary about this lady on YouTube actually) 

My one other thing I think about with you is how we people can crave food when we are lacking something. Like, do you have a tapeworm? One thing is to crave sugars and fats and junk, as that makes us high and thus we can get addicted. But meats, that's a bit odd. It could either be some sort of obsession and compulsion, but we ***know*** that meats are exactly where you can get parasites and tapeworms. And it's where we get iron.

A very bad stigma has come about with how teenagers ""want attention"", but its honestly normal and healthy for a teenager to crave approval and attention. It will most likely lessen with age. You are a blooming lady and it feels good to be seen and recognized, and altho though feel good if someone tells you you're sexy, it doesn't mean to want anyone to actually cross your boundaries. When you are ""against"" catcalling and public attention like this, try to think of it this way: it's not just for you, you are also against it for those who actually do not want it. When I was your age, if I felt down, I would dress up with a good push-up bra and just walk down the street in the capital of my country, where I live. I would fold up the experiences and keep them in my mind, to feel good and validated.

Another time much more recently, I had to go to a dance class, and my bike broke and it was immensely hot, so I had to go through the city in very revealing clothes (pretty much what looks like a bathing suit, but with pants on). The attention made me feel SO bad, it was slimey and disgusting.

Vulnerable people can push boundaries because they feel distress and don't know how to handle it.

It means that people in vulnerable situations might accept stuff they normally wouldn't to feel better, and in our community, we have all agreed that it's better to protect those than to just accept anything from them. Just like we are talking about how people very drunk cannot consent and young people below the age of consent.

This commenter even agrees with you, and just try to tell you that despite not showing obvious discomfort, they might have felt uncomfortable when reflecting on a situation where they were in an especially vulnerable place, and you just stayed around and partook in what is generally seen as boundary crossing behavior. I live in a very liberal country with very loose ""sexual morals"", and this still seem very hard to navigate. Is it just completely impossible for you to believe that she felt vulnerable and felt that you have pushed a boundary that she in the end wasn't as comfortable with as she initially thought?

Even if we say, sure, in her drunken haze, she thought it was nice to get the closeness and approval from you, but when she woke up, she reflected on the situation and thought ""huh, why the hell did he stay that long? Was he trying for this, while I was in an ultimate situation of stress?"", and maybe she told her friend ""idk, he stayed longer than anyone else and wanted to cuddle, but it got weird and we seperated, and the situation felt bad"".

I'm a firm believer that some people can be oblivious to their own behavior, and I've experienced both men who were very creepy on purpose, and men who really didn't mean to. If you don't communicate that you are uncomfortable, it can be hard for the second group to know. And many people's survival instinct is to just ""go with it"" and act into a situation, to avoid the uncomfortable situation or even to avoid the anger that may persue if they act like they don't want to engage. 

I know one person who, as far as I believe, had been falsely accused. I know it happens. Ive heard other stories. I rarely heard anything of false accusations like this. In return, I both her many stories of assault - but - also many stories of situations in the gray zone, which these sound like. This does not seem like straight up just out of the blue situations. It seems like, especially with Kelly, that the situation was murky. Maybe it was not as ""chill"" and you think. 

Do you seriously believe it's 100% malicious ""I just want to ruin his life"" type of stuff, and that there is nothing here where she actually believes that it was uncomfortable, at least in retrospect, when she considered the situation as a whole?

The feministic movement called for a stop, and forced more laws against this. Because of this, the abuse of women were in the forefront. Today, we are talking more equality, and more men are being taken seriously, when sexually harassed or abused at work. But talking about experiencing abuse is always a taboo, as you have to present yourself as a victim. It's not fun.

 You know DMT (N-Dimethyltryptamine) is the chemical that washes over your brain when you die, like a hard drive wipe. I've known friends who would smoke this. They'd just go dissappear in the bathroom for 30 mins, then come out and explain in **explicit** detail on every day of their 6 years living in a magic elf forest or skyship or under a volcano. Years! Because there is no [flicker fusion threshold ]( To give us perception of time, they really were living years in minutes in their heads. So if this stuff washes over your brain like a tsunami, that's basically a chemically induced heaven limited only to your imagination. Your mind, body, and soul separates. Body rots (bummer, but you're not there anyways) and your mind goes into a dream state forever. But what of your soul? What makes you, you?

Quantum theory states that when we die, our [minds go to a different multiverse ]( (basically reincarnation) and as multiverses go, there are truly am infinite amount of them. So our soul basically ""duplicates"" to start over with a new mind to hold logic and memories, and a body for everything else. Or maybe it doesn't start over, maybe you have died but due to [quantum immortality ]( your Brain will always transfer to a multiverse you haven't died yet, until you run out. 

The important thing is to find peace within yourself, so when you do get that dmt rush it won't be a bad drug trip (hell) lots of different religions have their versions of attaining true inner peace, but they all say the same thing. The father, the son, and the Holy ghost ***is*** your mind, body, and soul ***is*** Brahman, Vishnu, and Shiva ***is*** Odin, Hoenir and lodur ***is*** zues, Poseidon, and Hades ***is*** atumn, shu, and tefnut. I could go on, but you get the point. 

The acceptance that people who have died and came back experienced true blissful peace in nothing (dmt hasn't kicked in) which the hindu would say is Brahman. Being at one energy with the world, also known as [quantum entanglement ]( To escape this forever cycle, the hindu believe in achieving moksha.

Your soul though creates a duplicate of your mind and body (as well as the rest of the ""universe"") and seamlessly blends the copy so you'll never noticed. In theory, you'll eventually not make a duplicate anymore, but a whole new mind (fresh with no memories or logic) and new body (like a baby) which is basically reincarnation and thus the cycle begins anew. Always and forever, unless you reach the moksha I was explaining earlier, but that could be just hopeful wishing.  Again, no one really knows for sure. And if they say they do, it's usually a sales pitch.

3. Finding peace within things you can and cannot control is what religion is supposed to bring. Peace is the end game goal. There's nothing you can do to stop death, it'll come for us all at one point. But being at peace with that is literally the hardest concept any human being can ever do. So don't worry if you don't understand now, there's still so much for you to learn and explore and do before then. It took me a whole lot of psych wards to become at peace with the things I can and cannot control. I have 6 kids now, and I know I won't be here forever. My purpose in life is to be the greatest memory I can be for my children to reflect on when I'm gone, and I'm at peace with that. 

""Just because your favorite song ends, doesn't mean you can't appreciate the music""

Also, life isn't a goal or a war to win. Instead it's an eternal dance. The more rigid you become, the harder the dance is. This one fact is what separates man from Gods (metaphorically speaking) and why a human soul is the most precious thing in all existence. So cherish it, and learn your dance friend",teenagers

You're spreading your wings, and it's understandable to be afraid of flight since it's been so long, and it means leaving a nest that you know and love. But there's so much out there to explore and experience before another nest even needs to pop into thought! It's ok to be codependent with yourself. Even though that kinda ruins the entire definition of codependent, but hopefully you get the jest. I'm so proud of you to make it this far, usually people really really struggle with concepts you seem already at peace with. 

Just as a disclaimer, my resources are varied. I'm a schizophrenic, so if any of it sounds like the ramblings of a mad man, it's because it literally is. I recommend straight up meditation. [this should help explain](  even though its from a cartoon, its incredibly accurate. The first is your root chakra, aka your connection with everything around you. Just go outside, smoke some good good, relax and appreciate the nature of everything around you. Good ol classic root. Don't worry about the other chakras yet, just master this one first. When you meditate, try thinking about those traumas. What they mean, how the impacted you, how to prevent yourself from pushing that onto others, and finally acceptance. Religion helped me with acceptance (I believe more in God than religion, if that makes sense. I could go on a whole tangent on that) a prayer (aka mantra) that helped me was the serenity prayer. But if you don't take kindly to that I understand, there are other things to do in place of it",relationship_advice

It just feels hard because of course you don't want to hurt your current partners feelings, and the overthinking only adds fuel to that fire.

You know what a command prompt is on a computer? Just a window with a blinking dot, and if you have no idea what or how to do things, it's kinda pointless. Even if you were to try putting in a line of code or text or whatever, without proper syntaxes and rules, it'll just fuck something up, or do nothing. 

But if you keep coming back to the command prompt over and over, you might stumble upon something cool. Like now the text looks different or  somehow changed screen brightness. That's cool and all, but you don't really realize the power of command prompt until you learn to use it. 

Now, say you went a got a whole ass computer science degree, and one of the basic things they teach you is to master the command prompt for easier ways of doing large tasks. Example: oh man, everything is kinda slow and sluggish. What's my ping? And you know exactly how to run a tracert to find the exact place where you're not receiving any data like you should.

A sound soul, dwells within a sound mind, and a sound body.

It's all manuals on how to reach enlightenment, aka true peace. Just pick your favorite.

Quantum physics align with these as well.

They can be created where time doesn't have to be a factor, like the double slit experiment where shit realigns itself based on what your mind decided to see evern retroactively. Which universe do you reside in? Ask schrodinger's cat. 

All the answers are out there, and no knowledge is ever forbidden. If it was, it wouldn't exist. It's only mankind that puts restraints on our growth. Go out and discover what you think, we're truly in a fascinating era. I recommend looking up the works of Socrates and his devine gifts thesis.

Also saw alot of irl death. When I was 6, I saw a patio on a 3rd story apartment building collapse with a bunch of people on it. Not everyone survived. At 12 got involved in a drive by. My cousin and I were ok, but the other 2 guys sure wasn't. 14 I got stabbed in the side, and I caved this kids face in. He's alive, but in a veggie state when I last heard about him. 15 got stabbed fucking again and left me to die behind a gas station, lucky I was found. 

Then I joined the navy! In Istanbul turkey we were in a crowd of people when suicide bombers started going off. I was thrown around a bunch, got TBI, and now I'm so scared of crowds ITs hard to go to grocery stores even ti feed myself. Then I volunteered for IA assignment and went boots on ground in Syria.

I agree. All we can do is learn and grow. It's such a crazy world, our minds our, and I'm sure you don't need me to tell you how powerful a human mind truly can be. In a quantum sense, we can literally create universes! But when that power becomes overwhelming, it becomes a curse. Your old man seemed like a good man, from what you say.

I've always said a shut mouth is the death of a beautiful mind, im glad you decided to reply. 

Sometimes all you want to do is just survive the day. Always talking about your issues (mental or not) always seems draining, and picks at the scab that's already clotted over.

username#00648,comment,2023-09-12 15:13:08,,"Thank you for sharing! There definitely is a stigma against it. It makes it easier to talk about it on here because of anonymity. It definitely was the ""rub dirt on it and get over it"" era. I'm happy to see many people actively participating in mental health awareness and treatment. My parents were much the same. I've always had schizophrenia my whole life, my mom said I've been screaming and staring at corners of walls since before I can remember. She would watch my eyes as I follow something around the room. Instead of treatment though, they told me it was a ""spiritual gift"" that allowed me to see the world for what it truly is with demons and angels. They'd use me as a holy Geiger counter to see if I see anything in homes or churches or whatnot. When they started getting so bad I would scream and cry I went to live with my grandfather. He wasn't just a pastor, he was an exorcist and tried praying the demons out of me. Wasn't all that bad though, grandpa taught me many of the core beliefs I have now to help me, just not all of them. 

I know what it's like to be told it's all in your head, that's just what thinking is, im over reacting and whatnot. When the voices start telling you things you don't know, that's when to worry. It really was a much different time just one generation ago. My heart goes out to you and your stepfather, im so sorry he had to go through what he did.

Becoming high functioning isn't easy. I also have 6 kids, so I have ti function no matter what. I don't let my kids see my struggles, they don't need to. The very second I became a parent, my purpose in life is to be the best memories for my children. They don't need to remember my psychosis, but I want them to remember how to love and be loved. How to fix a flat tire, how to deal with a break up, how to shave, and give memories like playing their favorite game (I'll never understand roblox) or taking them out to a fancy dinner just because. 

That's what I want them ti remember. Not that I was staring at a bag of twisslers in target for 45 mins straight scaring customers, or going on a 12 hour ""walk"" where I just went straight until my legs hurt too much to move (wife found me luckily) or how I throw up literally every morning because I'm so fucking scared, or any of those things.

I will always have time for them, and remind them that they are safe and so very loved. I imagine that's what your stepfather did as well (if I may be so bold to state though.

It'll just bounce right off, no matter how many times you try, and end up breaking and denting things. You have to use the tool **properly** and have the education to use it, and there's nothing you can't fix.




You know what a command prompt is on a computer? Just a window with a blinking dot, and if you have no idea what or how to do things, it's kinda pointless. Even if you were to try putting in a line of code or text or whatever, without proper syntaxes and rules, it'll just fuck something up, or do nothing. 

But if you keep coming back to the command prompt over and over, you might stumble upon something cool. Like now the text looks different or  somehow changed screen brightness. That's cool and all, but you don't really realize the power of command prompt until you learn to use it. 

Now, say you went a got a whole ass computer science degree, and one of the basic things they teach you is to master the command prompt for easier ways of doing large tasks. Example: oh man, everything is kinda slow and sluggish. What's my ping? And you know exactly how to run a tracert to find the exact place where you're not receiving any data like you should.

Stress less about why, and it's important to realize it doesn't work. You're right, even I said it, but this entire post was wrapped around that. How people are initially drawn in on the peace aspect, but then dissolves into just drugs. That's true! How is my situation (minus the disorders) different from anyone else's struggle? Boiled down, you're absolutely right. Maybe I just tell myself it's peace because it's easier to fall back on a drug than it is to actually put the effort to solving the problem in the first place. I can slap away the symptoms with weed sometimes (not anymore) but it'll never go away until I kill the root. This may not come to a surprise, but no treatment for 2 years now. I kept forgetting to take my meds (I also have traumatic brain injuries from multiple concussive blasts when I was stationed overseas) so when I forget it fucks with me hard. Like my wife had to take off work to make sure I wouldn't do anything really crazy. So I said fuck it, it's doing more damage than good.

I do agree, it really is hard to distinctively differentiate addiction and coping mechanism. It is like your alcohol example as you said. I also have ptsd as well, blown up in the military and all that and I was in a really traumatic childhood situation. I say this to relate to the vivid traumas. I get flash backs and space out for a while. A few months back, a target employee asked me if I was ok because I was staring at the bag of twisslers in my hand for 45 mins straight and I was scaring the customers. I throw up every single morning because of my anxiety. Literally will only miss maybe 3 or 4 days out the month of not being so scared and confused I vomit. I don't mean to complain, I hate complaining, but It really is awful. 

I have no silence. Ever. It's like a high school cafeteria of voices, where it's just a constant murmur of voices in the background. Then the other voices that speak in full sentences and say crazy shit pop in there every so often. But the murmurs never ever stop. They'll get loud, angry, scared, shocked, all kinds. Just never silent. Pot really was the only way to make it not go away, but much more manageable and even advantageous like o said. But that's exactly what an addict would say! How is that any different? I understand a drug is a drug. But am I addicted to the drug, or am I addicted to just feeling some peace? Or the ability to even function. I got kids, ill never burden them with my crazy so I hide it as best I can. I love them all so much. 

I'm not going to smoke anymore, I can't if it's all risk no reward now. Those days are gone. I'm just confused as to how? Surely there's some scientific explanation. But maybe the reason I'm so obsessed with why it stopped is because deep down I think I can reverse it to start my addiction back up again? I'm sorry I talk so much.

Well, one of the youth leaders, younger sisters, boyfriends, sister started coming weekly, too. We'll just call her scuba because I don't wanna give names and think it's a funny word.

One day, during worship songs, Scuba asked if we could both go outside real quick, and I did. So we went behind the church where it was dark, and suddenly, she was trying to get me hard. And I'm 14, so it's not that difficult, and the next thing I know, she's riding me as I sit against a wall. We finish, she goes to the bathroom to clean up, and I just walk back into church right in the middle of the sermon, like nothing happened. 

After that, she kinda kept wanting to hang out to do it again, but no foreplay and not even kissing. Just straight to it. I was very much a people pleaser, and come on, this should be every guys dream, right?

The biggest push away for me was like I said I grew up christian, my great grandfather was even a pastor. My step dad came from a very catholic upbringing, so when my step grandma came to pass all the family came to see her off. Let me say that my grandma was the sweetest old lady you can ever think of. Like hand written notes in greeting cards for every holiday (like arbor day) with a $5 even in my mid 20s. Always watched her rosary every night at 530, followed by a glass of wine, 2 cloves of garlic, and a double feature of jeopardy and wheel of fortune. Sweetest ever

When my christian grandparents came to see her on her death bed, they told all of us that she was going to hell because she was catholic and not Christian, and we need to hurry and convert her before she dies to ""save"" her

I was fucking appalled, so was my mother and we dare not tell my father that or someone will die. How can such a sweet and loving person be damned? That's not God, that's the toxic fucking disease to justify self righteous judgement in a feeble attempt to feel superior. I hated it, then years later my mother confessed to believing it to. If that's Christianity then fuck that, God taught me unconditional love was un-fucking-conditional. No exceptions.

I know its awful, but for some reason it never effected me the way my therapists and psychologists said. It would absolutely make my audio and visual hallucinations 10x worse, but I felt it empowered me 20x. I can basically ""summon the council of voices"" and use them to my advantage to figure shit out about past trauma, present day stressor, and real attainable goals for the future. However if I had to much, it would always end in a full psychotic break down. Like, it's terrifying and I hate it so I always measure exactly how much I smoke, calculate in my tolerance and I had a great system. It truly is night and day difference, to control those thoughts instead of being their victim. 

That being said, it did help me make sense of lots of things. Like Gandolf said, ""the halflings leaf allows me to think my thoughts without aggression."" But something really fucking weird happened recently. I had a mental snap about three Weeks ago (not going into detail, but it was bad. I broke a mental foundation) and now when I smoke, it's always too much. Always sends me into a psychosis. They yell at me like why are you here? What are you doing? It's like having access to the entire library of the akoshtic records, but now extremely suddenly and immediately I've been exiled. Like that scene from a Christmas story, where Santa boots the kid down the slide when he tries to come up? It's like that now. So I can't smoke anymore after that. All the stuff my therapist and psychologist said would happen are now happening suddenly. It sucks man, I can't even use it recreationally anymore. It was the only, ONLY thing to get my voices under control. I've had meds after meds after meds but none of them really made a difference to my audio and visual hallucinations like weed did.

That ""oh what is this? This is new! It's scary yet... I want more"" and all other thoughts go away because you just felt the horny for the first time? What a high, and it's a high people chase often that can lead to very detrimental attitudes and de senitization. It's lust! Not love really, but pure lust. It's human, but some cultures (especially abrahamic religions) call that feeling a sin. And it's your choice to give into temptation (that's the tingle) or turn the other cheek. One of those is stated to light you in a damning lake of fire for all eternity, so the choice is kinda made for them (in that reality, im speaking in a vaccum) the problem is, that feeling of lust can really come frome anyone, or anything. So if it came from something that wasn't socially acceptable, then it's your fault for resting temptation. But if you get caught fucking your teacher, high fives all around (mens perspective) but also a stern talking to. But that's gets a talking to, and the gays get thrown off buildings. So it's not really fair. 

TL;DR: Lust is a sense like the other devine gifts.(Socrates)  We know when we feel it, however our opinion of what that sense means it can be confuzzled.

They refused Amy cash I tried to give them as rent, so I tried helping out as much as I could around the house. The husband wasn't very well versed in that kind of stuff, which is fine. I fixed up their car, roof, all the gardening and landscaping, babysat, build play rooms and stuff. It was a great gig. One day, at 3 a.m. they woke me up outbof my bed and asked if I wanted tequila shots. Fuck it! Yeah why not. We go drink in the garage so they can smoke that mary Jane and drink with me. After a while, the wife tells me she has a confession. She thinks I'm hot (flattering) and wants to fuck me. I instantly tell the husband to not worry, their friendship means more to me than going behind he's back with an affair. But he said he knew, and he wanted to. He was a cuck. Just wanted to jack off while I fucked his wife. I knew I shouldn't, but I was lonely and depressed so why not? She likes the rough stuff. Like, spitting in her face and I slap her hard and fuck her while she faces him and tells him in detail how much better my cock was. It was slightly out my comfort zone, but fuck it I'm getting my dick wet. After that, nothing was the same. His sex drive wasn't as crazy high as gers, so she'd fuck me constantly. I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining, at the time I thought I hit a jackpot. Like in the middle of playing halo with the husband, shell just start sucking my dick next to him. Or my favorite, is when she'd give me spongebaths while stroking and sucking me. It was great, but the switch never went back to friendship. It was just constant fucking which was great, but that depressive post nut clarity always kicks in as I realized I'm whoring myself for a place to stay. I got great fuck buddy's, but I lost my only friends at the time. I was getting separating from the military, I literally had no other friends. I regret saying yes that tequila night. It's fun every once and a while, but not at the cost of loved ones. I had to move out and we eventually lost contact.

TL;DR I moved in with a married friend I've known for years. Turns out he was a cuck, and I fucked his wife which was great at first. But it was too constant, and it never went back to how our friendship was. I felt trapped in that house because I had nowhere else to go, and was basically whoring out myself.

He kept adding more pallets to the fire, making it bigger so much that we all had to pull our trucks further away because of the heat.

Otherwise, smoking weed can have the same effects as cigarettes because either way it's smoke, smoke your not really supposed to enhale excessively, second hand high doesn't really exist because what's been exhaled is just leftovers and if it gets in your face it's no different than any other smoke.

I've slept on couches, rented rooms, had my own apartment, got a house with friends, stayed a few months on mom's couch to try college after GED.  Never held a job or had a home for over a year, only have traffic violations never been to prison, lost my license because I couldn't afford the tickets but have since driven into a tree to just try and end the fear.   

I got my girlfriend pregnant and she cheated on me when my son was 3, he went to live with her and even though she was verbally abusive, being without my son hurt me so bad.   I would have him every weekend and then some.   I met someone in a parenting group online and fell in love. I visited a few test and she got pregnant while we were both probably not mentally stable enough to decide to have a baby.  I moved across the country to start over saying I'd come visit monthly.   

I couldn't afford to do that because I can't stay stable enough to even work.    I work and get insurance and am medicated and drag myself to work, I have a schizophrenic episode and can't leave for a day and have to stay home to try to be a normal human without voiceses screaming at me all the time saying the worst things you could ever think, hearing your children cry out for you in pain.     I can't afford bills and gas and meds so the meds stop... I lose the job because I get even worse and the insurance was pointless because it didn't cover hardly anything in the first place and was over 300$ a month to stay somewhat functional, get on state aide and need to work again so I try meds and do it again.  

I miss my son so much and by being so mentally fucked and not being able to stay at a job visiting is tough, he feels uncomfortable on Facebook video chat so I dont push it.   

Should I write letters? Make videos on YouTube? I don't think his mom says how I'm sick and can't be a Fucking adult.   I'm so shameful being a dad to my daughter and then go to my step kids events.  We live with my in laws because the wife has BPD and we've been trying to take care of her and neglecting my mental health.  

I'm an adult and these excuses are so rediculous for the life I made and make those suffer around me.  I just need advice on how to stop making people hate me and want to be with other people.   I love my kids and never want the without me like my father did when he decided to leave.    But I left my son and now my wife and I can't afford to go back and forth because I'm so crazy.   

I'm just so scared all the time, how can I make videos for him when I cry everyday for two years seeing him maybe a handful of times.  I ruined his childhood and now he is struggling and I can't even buy him a video game, when he asks for a consol.  I have to hand make a card for my 7 year old son like I'm in prison.   I need to stay alive for them.   ",TrueOffMyChest

I know some people spend entire days reading. I'd like to do that too, so should I just power through? My eyes and possibly even my brain gets tired.

Switching back and forth between two books helps somewhat, as if I get bored of one I can switch to the other and then when I get bored of that one I can switch back. It helps if the two books have very different style and subject matter (e.g. one fiction and one nonfiction).

I seem to be harboring the possibly delusional idea that if I read too much I'll not get as much out of it, and should just stop after only a chapter or two.

How much time do you spend reading at a time? Do you wish you could spend more time in a single sitting? If you are able to read a lot, how do you do it?",books

These things don't have much to do with each other, so I have to carefully knit them together so they connect. So far I think I've done a decent job at making causality link these various pieces of writing. My main question to the community is whether you have any experiences where instead of ""writing"" you're just gathering stuff that will increase your word count.

EDIT: I should add that I am proud of these various writings, and believe readers would find them interesting on their own, but may suspect that together they are not advancing a common plot. This is fine because many books are more about the word to word imagery than about some epic story arc and these books do fine, but I'm not sure how it will work in my book.",writing

username#00662,post,2023-03-08 03:42:11,How to navigate drug addict step father,"I am 26 M and live with my parents and can't move out. In Australia. I have a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, that's why I can't work and move out. I don't have anyone I can ask for realistic support.

My step dad uses whatever drug he uses and treats everyone as his maid everyday, and he has at the moment untreated bipolar II, he stopped seeing his psychiatrist like 5 years ago. We can't send him to the hospital as he isn't a danger to anyone. All he does all day is eat chocolate and drink high sugar alcohol mixers.

He causes major drama with my mum and teenage sister. And I can't be stressed out because it makes my illness A LOT worse. And if we ignore him he gets really defiant and causes damage to whatever he wants to damage or he becomes really abusive.

I have told him to go to a hotel and use whatever drugs he wants, but don't do it around us and he denies using, even though he collapses onto his knees next to his bed and stays in that position for hours, or he acts like he has Alzheimer's and does random shit and trashes the place. And denies that he did it when he sobers up for an hour then returns to using.

I don't really know what to do, because I tried calling the local mental health service, but they have to talk to him personally and there's no way he would do that.

I want to act like he doesn't exist, but he causes so much trouble for my mum and sister if I personally ignore him.

&#x200B;

EDIT: forgot to mention he has been using for about a constant 6 years, but has a history of using on and off for about 12 years. ",Advice

I am wondering if there are any jobs where you don't have to work in a team environment or talk to coworkers? 

My personality is very flat and I am not interested in anything and stress makes me very ill, interacting with people makes me feel unaimed guilt and conflict so I don't do that.

username#00663,post,2023-08-02 18:43:49,Is this how adults make friends?,"Literally any input on this would be fantastic. I (21AFAB) don't have friends, other than my spouse (22M) whom I've known since highschool, and he thinks this guy's approach is weird. I don't know what's ""normal"" in the adult world, either. I just got here.

I met him a few days ago at my job and we had a really nice conversation. We talked a little before he asked if I wanted to go out to dinner sometime, of which I responded, ""sorry I have a boyfriend"". We talked a little more, exchanged numbers, and he's waited a day to ask me out for a snack tomorrow.

My spouse has yet to come home to evaluate the situation, I will speak to him when he gets home, but otherwise I do NOT trust my own judgement. I don't know what it means to be social at all. I was extremely isolated before I turned 20. This man seems very nice but I am oh so gullible. Especially when it comes to older adults as he seems a tic older than me and my spouse.

My spouse told me this is exactly how he got me away from my abusive ex and he's pretty sketched out. At the same time he really wants me to have a friend. I can see that he is very torn as am I.

TLDR: Man asked to have dinner with me, Told him I had a boyfriend, and later asked to get ice cream. Is this how adults make friends?",relationships

But my daily work I do now is do all the dishes (2x a day), clean the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, sweep and mop, wipe all counters, tables, and dust, vacuum (2x a day), scoop the dog mess, and take out the trash (all supposed to be done by 2 pm). On weekends I have cleaning all the windows and walls added onto the daily. Then every day I get treated like I don't do anything around the house, get called a free loader and I'm abusing my mom and step dad's generosity. When I bring up that I'm doing everything they ask and more sometimes (because if it's not SPOTLESS then it's like nothing has been done) I am threatened with being kicked out. 

Is this too much chores? Am I just being a big baby about doing chores?  I don't know what to do but I feel like I'm gonna snap one of these days I get told I'm lazy and just sit around.",Advice

username#00664,post,2019-06-23 20:37:05,Started having bad dreams and hearing voices. Am I going crazy and should I get help?,"So when I was younger I had a history of sleep paralysis. Then it went away for a long while but recently (almost two months ago) I started having it again but it's the same dream. A tall thin man  hidden in shadow at the edge of my bed just staring at me. I get such a sense of dread from him just looking at me. It started as one dream then another time but now it's almost 3-4 times a week I have this dream. The awful feeling of dread and impending doom that I get from these has made it very hard for me to sleep and to not want to sleep at all. I do end up sleeping because at a certain point I just pass out. But then even more recent I've been hearing voices. Not like voices in my head but it sounds like a legitimate voice from either near me, behind me, or in my ear. The voice is male and says things that don't make sense ""Her"", ""That"", ""No"" etc. it's always one word because I usually flip my shit and go sit with my girlfriend for a bit. This has been going on for a few days now and I'm dreading going anywhere outside my room and even there I don't want to sleep. I know I need help but where? Who do I go to? What the hell is causing all this? Need advice. 

Ps. I have a feeling this is how a lot of people think they are being haunted but I know I just need some help.",Advice

One night my friend and I decided to hike to the top of this small mountain at night for a meteor shower. There were 4 of us, all around 16 at the time, and thought it would be cool. We drove over and started hiking. We took a break about half way when we noticed there was a guy following us... in a business suit? We were weirded out so we decided to start back up and walk a bit faster. But by the next time we stopped he was like 10 feet away so we bit the bullet to see if he'd just walk by. He didn't. He stopped and asked if we were there for the meteor shower and if he could walk with us. Weird a 30 something year old man in a suit wanting to hike with four 16 year olds but whatever. As we were walking my friend and I notice he was walking really close to our friend (the only girl in the group) like he could smell her shampoo close. We got to the top, sat down, and he sat down almost right up on our friend. With her reasonably freaked out I made and excuse on why we have to leave early and we promptly booked it the fuck out of there. Nearly running the entire way down. When we got back to the car we thought ""cool we ditched the weirdo"". But no. When we were all in the car our my friend pointed out that this guy is FULL ON SPRINTING down the trail and towards our car with a large stick. Being in a car we just drove out of there very shook up. We chalked it up to some dude on some hell of a drug but 2 days later we all got a text linking us to a news report about a guy that had strangled his wife and then proceeded to kill another girl later that night on a hiking trail. It. Was. The. Guy. The same dude at the same hiking trail. 
We never told our parents about the incident and never went back there. EVER.

Everything was making it sensitive, walking, my emotions, even little touches on my body that my partner does that shouldn't be sexual makes me go off. 

It feels weird, walking makes me turned on the feeling is hard to describe just sensitive. When I'm feeling an emotion like excitement or something like that it goes off like crazy. Also when I think about something that gets me going not even a second after thinking it it goes off lmao. Also for me I find that it feels different when I masturbate when I'm on t than it did before t, if that makes sense?

I was at work today and it felt so awkward I felt turned on and sensitive made me feel like a perv while dealing with customers lmaoo. My third shot is this Monday, oh boy I'll see what this week brings me.

Not complaining tho, never really felt turned on pre t tho due to trauma and severe bottom dysphoria. Learning how to love it, makes me feel whole and good about my bottom growth. I'm sure my partner loves it too ;p",ftm

Depending on your age you're more likely to do most of them. It also depends on how you phrase/put yourself out there. You have to make yourself like able and be very reasonable about your prices and what not. 

You'd be surprised how many ppl need help with easy tasks, especially If you live in a family/senior friendly area. Put up signs around your area for side jobs of your choice, whatever you are capable to do.

About the two week mark ((dont know because normally I dont look at my downstairs area cause of dysphoria)) I looked down there cause of all the sensitive and sensitivity I've been feeling a lot stronger lately and I've noticed it started to get big.

I also noticed acne about the end of the first week and oily skin. I've also noted that my smell downstairs and my pits are starting to change too. Oh ya, I also noticed my body temp changed within the first week too. Normally I'm a very cold person and I HAVE to go outside with layers on in the winter. Now I can go out without layers and even have my jacket unzipped if it's nice enough, every little thing I do causes me to sweat or get over heated and its annoying but I love it tho lol. I always keep my deodorant with me cause I work and end up moving and lifting alot, scared of smelling bad.


I know I didnt answer some it and or I'm not on t for long enough and I thought I'd give you some input on my transition. Also, remember that everyone is different when they start t some feel the effects really fast or some are slower than others. Genetics play a big role.

He can be needy and territorial and bitey (and boy do hookbills hurt). The first thing we have to do in the morning is give him some undivided attention and flight time (we do not clip his wings). And that is regular throughout the day. He lives with us and is around us all the time, and we don't make too many decisions without thinking about how it will impact him. We don't stay out late or do stuff that is very disruptive to his schedule. So the reward of having a bird is huge, but it also means you have to give them a lot of love and care. But that is like any animal or person that you bring into your life.

We're lucky that ours is a big talker, he talks all the time and has learned a bunch of different things so far, including: his name, ""good boy"", ""I'm a good boy"", ""scritches"" (when he wants to have his head scratched), and when we have the stove top espresso maker on in the morning he says ""coffee's ready"" when he hears it going off. 

I think it takes a bit of time before a bird really trusts you and shows his personality and we're getting that. So his comical and funny nature is a real thing that I love about him. He also screams his head off when he's flying around.

username#00673,comment,2016-08-23 09:41:27,,"The things I address in therapy are often nothing about my present, though things that happened to me in the past effect my present. Trauma and emotional neglect as a child created an insecure attachment base. Going into those places, talking through and sitting with those old feelings allow me to integrate them, and resolve them. Slowly and in small amounts is my base becoming more secure. 

Safety is difficult, and trusting myself has been difficult, so instead of resolving those root issues I have historically looked to my partner to fill that gap. That's a black hole, he can't fill it. This has taken years, at least three of my learning about and discovering whole parts of myself that have never had a chance to grow, and there is still much work to do. I often don't even discuss this with my own SO because I know that it isn't about my present relationship, it's about the relationship and quality of care I recieved from my very *first* relationship (caregivers). We both are in a process like this and encourage and are invested in each others own process, but I don't pry into his [own personal work], or go into things that are best discussed within and with a therapist. 

The push/pull stuff, comes out with unresolved issues, discomfort, inability to process unresolved issues. The most you can do is focus on yourself and trust with intent that improvement will come with time.",relationship_advice
username#00673,comment,2016-08-23 09:23:49,,"No, having a partner that is reassuring did nothing to change my responses when my attachment style was triggered. The only thing that has changed my responses is taking it into therapy to be worked out within the therapeudic alliance. 

I simply cannot expect or ask my partner to consistently reassure me that my fears are unfounded. It's too much to ask him to do. It's not his ""stuff"" - it's mine. Constantly expecting or needing that kind of reassurance is often too much for anyone to bear, because it's an emotionally taxing and exhausting thing to have to respond to. I know that because I used to need that constant kind of communication from my partner. He is infact supportive, but he has boundaries and that's healthy for a relationship. He is extremely supportive and encouraging, but there are limits to how much he can respond to those fears.

Through therapy I have altered much of my responses to just *being* in relationship which have in the past served as a trigger for anxious behaviour. Does that mean I don't have anxious reponses to situations? No. I do, less now, but I have learned how to hold and take care of those rising feelings myself, and not bring that into my relationship dynamic. It is though holding those feelings myself that I have come to understand and change my responses to things that are difficult in relationship. Being in relationship does allow for those difficult and painful feelings to arise and I have methods of dealing with it - journalling, therapy, other integrating activity. I am thankful that the relationship is the container for (personal and partnered) growth but the work is my own to do. I still have a lot of work *to do* but I am doing it and I know that I have healed whole parts of myself...*that* has made me a better partner. Reassurance, while nice, really wasn't at the root of the issue, the real problems have nothing to do with my present, they happened a long time ago and that needed professional attention as well as attention from me to my own wounded parts. 

Time and effort makes a relationship stronger. Growth and change make a relationship stronger. So does owning your own stuff. I am a firm believer that a relationship is to allow two people to grow and change, and you can help support the other in acheiving their own personal goals. Other things like patience and trust - trusting the other to sometimes hold difficult feelings, to be able to share those feelings with the other are also very important. Don't neglect the relationship you have with yourself. I put the same amount of effort that I put into the relationship between myself and partner as I do with me and my own damaged parts. 

Improving starts with you. Your partner can support and encourage, and help nurture that growth but they are in no way responsible for it. If you are committed to changing yourself then that change will happen, I don't doubt that at all. 

Good luck OP :)",relationship_advice
username#00673,comment,2016-07-07 20:30:41,,"I can sympathise with this.

I (30s/F) grew up on the East Coast of the US, where we had spiders - big and small - that were poisonous. When I was 11 or 12 I was bitten by one and it landed me in the hospital. I love insects but I've never been fond of spiders because of this incident, and as a result in the past I usually had to have other people remove spiders if I've found them in the house, etc. I used to really freak out, to the point of being inconsolable, and that had a lot to do with living with trauma, mostly childhood trauma, so if I saw a spider I'd project all this other stuff onto it and the subsequent removal of it, and it would turn into this big deal and I'd feel miserable and embarrassed and full of shame.

I moved from the US to another country* where there *are* spiders but 99% of them are harmless, even the ones that are big and kind of scary looking. My partner is from this country, and he isn't afraid of spiders at all. He removed a fairly large one (4"" sized garden spider) from the living room the other day and was totally cool about it. He used to be really confused or curious or get frustrated (""they're harmless"" he'd say, which was true) about how afraid I was of them, until I explained that I had a history of living around spiders that weren't so harmless. He has reassured me hundreds of times that they won't hurt me, and I don't freak out anymore when I see them, but I still am not a huge fan of them. It took a long time to really articulate what was going on. I started going to therapy to resolve some of that trauma stuff and as a result I can deal with things like seeing huge spiders and not *totally* freak out. I still don't get upclose and personal with them, but I can handle being in their proximity. And resolving some of that stuff has allowed me to articulate the actual issue, so now he is happy about removing spiders (he was anyway but never understood why I wouldn't/couldn't) and understanding where I am coming from.


It's not childish at all. So, I'd recommend some patience, and maybe gently bring up a suggestion of therapy for your girlfriend. Or encourage her to find out why she might be so afraid, perhaps she is afraid of telling you why she doesn't like them as it might involve painful memories or abuse or fear or something. She might find out that her fear has less to do with spiders and maybe more about something unresolved with her.

I do understand trauma and shattering heartbreak, deep pain and the need for distance. In my own experience, the person I am in-love with has expressed similar sentiments that you say. We both come from a background with trauma, and that has made us mirrors to each other - painful to bear sometimes, easy to make love unbearable. Like you, he always wanted distance to process pain or discomfort. He is a gentle person and he takes anything he's ever done to anyone very seriously,  while also very strong he cannot bear causing pain to others as so much has been done to him. He would always want to sit silently, process inwardly. I remember him saying that, that even when he was a teenager he would just go off, and that's true he would go off and be alone, live alone...those stories always broke my heart. He was so tender, so much of his life he hadn't been acknowledged, or he had been misunderstood. We both understood what it was like to look into the abyss, I never had to describe that to him. I know I didn't always give him that solitude he wanted or needed because I was so sorry he was alone and in pain for so long, but that was his style. But not giving that did seem like brushing it off or being smothering or whatever. It was never the intention but all that stuff we learn in childhood says otherwise...

I am sorry for your heartache, or that this person is not acknowledging your pain. Perhaps after you've processed your feelings a little more you could say that. I didn't know myself exactly what was meant in terms of needing to be at a distance to process and let go of things, once explained I did understand that better.

My ex had a very similar response to being ""in-love"" - and he is over twenty years older than you! In my (our) particular case he had a trauma background that made it very difficult to trust love. He had always *wanted* to fall in-love (I'm saying that to differentiate between *having* love for a person), which he did - with me. And he was partially ecstatic to have it - this thing he had waited such a long time for, but also he felt ill being in-love. He broke up with me actually because he felt like being with me was like being on a drug, and he had no control and felt invaded. It's a terrible dichotomy because its something we want and long for but when it causes pain or makes one feel like they are taking drugs, it is understandable to push that [person] away. Extra difficult when it causes conflict, wanting the person, but not wanting to feel out of control or invaded. Equally for the other person to also be in love with this person while knowing that it causes them such difficulty. Sigh!

Being in-love or falling in-love is usually a pleasant experience, if not intense and sometimes difficult. However, yeah if someone might have had experiences of associating love with something bad or hurtful that love might *feel* painful, like you want to get rid of it or stay away. I had a hard time with it personally, as he wanted it - *needed* it - but trying to trust it caused him pain. Those things that we long for became a cause for distress. In his case hopefully with (continued) therapy he will be able to associate being in love with something good, or fulfilling. It remains a vital and important human emotion and need, we aren't built to be alone, and being in love with someone can be the most wonderful thing on earth. 

I'm not saying that you've got any kind of clinical issue, most likely you are feeling intensely for your girlfriend and over time it will even out a bit. But there are others out there that don't always see love as a good feeling! Good luck OP",relationships

Perhaps he doesn't want to start a relationship just before he leaves the country, maybe he has met someone else and wishes to pursue it, perhaps he doesn't feel how you do. I don't know if it would be a good idea to continue a friendship with him, you want and feel something he doesn't and that isn't fair for either of you. You can ask what he feels but it honestly sounds like he has told you already, and it doesn't seem like being together is in the cards for him. It won't feel good for him to oblige you, it wouldn't be honest and it wouldn't (really) be what you want - which is him to feel the same way about you. If he were to agree to a relationship, the problem would quickly switch from ""why won't he be in a relationship with me"" to ""why don't you love me enough"", ""why is he pulling away""...whatever, it would just turn into a different issue because somewhere a need won't be being met.

He might indeed enjoy your company, being physical, being close, but it sounds like he has stopped short of falling in love with you. Some people can be physical with ""friends"" and leave it at that, others can't. I can sense you really care for him, but try to distance yourself enough to understand it does not appear mutual.

I agree with what another poster has said: pre-marital therapy or just therapy for yourself. Feeling ashamed and embarrassed about yourself is not a good way to live (in general) and shouldn't be a way to start off a (continued) life together.

Relationships are largely a process. Sometimes easier and sometimes it's really rough and feels like there is little reason to be in a relationship all-together. Feeling confused or hurt or angry is pretty normal, however that does not give license for your bf to hurt you without recourse or consideration of your feelings. Is he willing to work on the relationship? Are you? From his perspective, I can see how feeling attracted to a partner is a need - it is a need for many people. Having certain needs unmet, or unable to be met, could lead to them being sought out elsewhere. It isn't possible for him to  force you to lose weight, or to have a body type that is pleasing to him or really anything about how you look. He may be projecting his own feelings about himself - how he has gained weight, the problems he is facing as he has gotten older - onto you.

You have already outlined here that your needs wouldn't be met if you were to enter into a romantic relationship with her. I would think about whether you are ""in-love"" with her, IMO I feel that being in-love is a feeling that expresses several things, including to a (generally large) extent physical attraction. That you already know you think about other women means you are projecting unmet needs on these ladies because the woman  you (say) you are in-love with isn't your type. Well, then she isn't the woman for you. 

This might be a hard pill to swallow, but frankly Olivia is meeting something in you that you need - perhaps to be validated, to feel important, to feel companionship, but that does not a good relationship make. It takes much more than that, and to enter into a marriage *knowing* that you aren't getting what you need will breed resentment, even if you feel like it's the ""right"" thing to do or whatever family thinks. Plus, it's not fair to her either.

That you get jealous of other guys is perhaps because you have enmeshed yourself with her enough to think that she should only give you her attention, but really...she is playing a kind of archetypal role for you (sorry to get all Jungian), possibly of the mother - perhaps meeting some kind of unresolved thing that you've never gotten before or been able to experience, and it feels a lot like love, cause it is, but it feels weird because it's not what you're calling it.

You might miss her, long for her companionship, but down the road will that be enough to quelch the fact that you are now in a situation where you are not letting whole parts of yourself grow just because you feel comfort (with this person)? If it were me, I would reflect on what is really going on, put a name to it, and let her go (enough that she can) find someone who meets all the needs that are really required - both you need to do that, and that will make you both happy (believe it or not!)

You two were broken up. Clearly despite the breakup you still had feelings for each other. Great! So you're together now. I could say a bunch of stuff about remaining in the present but it doesn't really seem practical. Look first at the situation: you weren't together, you were legit broken up, that means both you and her were single. You had the freedom to pursue new partners, be alone, join a convent, flee the country and join the French foreign legion, whatever. You couldn't have predicted the future and known that you were going to get back together ( you could hope though). For whatever reasons, and those reasons are not important, she slept with someone else. 

It really is not important to know the details or reasons. It is even impossible to know her true feelings about the situation (tip: don't ask). Doesn't matter. Presently she is with you and now you can have clear expectations and boundaries that pertain to loyalty and trust and stuff. If she loves you and you love her, just move forward from here. Don't let something that ultimately isn't a concern of yours ruin a beautiful potential future. It's ok to be jealous or even a little hurt, but remember she is with *you*.

I just think, its two different things. An SO is a go-to person, the person I'm in love with, share my life with but it's a different connection to my BFF who I also share experiences with. I dunno, I don't want my SO to be my best *friend*, I want them to be my partner. Your BFF is who you call when you've been detained by customs because you've brought a miniature sword in your carry-on and you're fined more than you can afford *ahem*. They both occupy difference spaces in my heart, but not having one or the other leaves a big hole. Neither replaces the other. But being in love with an SO means having boundaries in place that ""put them first"". 

I have a really contentious relationship with my BFF, especially lately. We're not really on super great terms (this will change in time) so our sharing is pretty superficial for now, because he refuses to acknowledge my choices and feelings toward another person and other things I do in my life. He's difficult which pretty much goes without saying (for example: I was going to his house the other day and he said ""bring some pastries"" so I go out and I buy some pain au chocolate [YES I KNOW ITS BREAD] and I get there and he has an absolute fit because I didn't bring a proper pastry. whatever), but the good outweighs the bad (generally), which is why I remain friends with him (I've had three psychics tell me we've spent several lifetimes together and have a soul agreement to have a difficult relationship *to help each other grow*, oh well isn't that nice. Still, he's close to me, he comes to me in dreams, I think of him often, sometimes we can't stand each other and other times we're all each other has. I absolutely adore him and he's a tough nut to crack but he even said ""I can't stay mad at you, even if I want to"". When we are getting along we've got a very Odd Couple kind of rapport. 

I would never consider him as a romantic prospect, I love him but I'm not *in love* with him. I think people expect something more from our friendship, because in the past we have spent a lot of time together and we've been thick as thieves. He's handsome and attractive but I'm not sexually attracted to him/I don't respond to him or his presence, and my heart warms to him like the brother I've had for a hundred lifetimes. He's also got ideals he wants from a woman that I disagree with as well as other beliefs that I think are outdated. Other friends who have met him (and he's exceedingly and misleadingly polite in public) think he'd ""be a great boyfriend!"" to which I tell them ""by all means go ahead, it was nice knowing you"".

Years of taking these medications also made me tired, overweight, depressed, changed my hair, my skin, my vision, my moods and ability to function etc. I do get that, often the side effects were worse than the symptoms themselves. 

However, not everyone who takes an anti-psychotic is crazy, and not all schizophrenics are ""crazy"". I was able to have a job, go to university, have relationships and live in my own home for the majority of my ""illness"". The same goes for other friends that I have who have also been diagnosed with sz. Sure, there were periods which weren't so great, but for the vast majority you wouldn't have been able to tell me from any other run-of-the-mill eccentric ;) Medications that are used to treat sz are often approved to treat other disorders too, like OCD and Bipolar. Though, that doesn't mean you've been diagnosed with those either. Additionally, heaps of meds have off label uses. I used an anti-convulsion medication to control weight, for example.

I had my first boyfriend at age 17 and he was 38. 
My first husband (who I met at age 19) was in his 50s when I met him. We were together 10 years, and he's now in his 60s. Age played a big role in our day-to-day relating though we still loved each other and he was sweetly clueless in life so pursued the heck out of him when we met. This is generally a non-normative age gap, which shaped me for better and worse.

My second serious partnership was age 29/30 and he was 42. Age didn't play a role in this relationship. Though it inadvertently did. He was very much ""on my level"" but he *was* older so he had simply gone through *time* and experiences in that which caused issues in our relationship (and his life). In this case, it was time and history working against me not a lack of love.

See if you can find her via usual social media outlets, if that doesn't work perhaps you know a family member who can relay a message. Reach out and see if she responds.

I've tried to do this twice. I lost a very good friend due to a misunderstanding about ten years ago. It's still unclear to me *why* but, we were working together at a terrible job, and he had more or less had a breakdown. It wasn't only me who he cut off, but after he walked out (of work) our friendship was strained, like he associated everything that had any connection to that job with something he couldn't be around. He also became a really bitter person. I ran into him once at the store and he turned around and walked away - this was someone who was my *best friend* for years. I tried to reconcile, but was met with no response. I did what I could, so I leave it. I still think about him, but I can't force a friendship that isn't wanted.

The second time went a little better. Another very close friend, who I did everything with. We hung out all the time. He had a lot of emotional problems, so while he was very kind, sometimes he would do things that were truly irksome. He fell madly in-love with a woman who didn't initially return his favours, so he became difficult to be around. We had an argument, I unfriended him on myspace (!!!!) and didn't speak for about four years. I would sometimes see him around town, which was awkward because he knew my mum and because he was a very decent person he'd stop and say hello if he saw her. Me and him though just had daggers at each other. I moved, I heard through other friends that him and this girl were (finally!) together and that he was happy. I was pretty happy with my life too, so I reached out with a message on facebook. He responded and we said we actually missed each other. We are now on good terms and talk occasionally. We aren't as close as we used to be, because we're in different places in our lives, but I'm glad to have him as a friend again.

He inherently sees everyone as knowing less than he does, which allows him to dispense advice as he sees fit. If he suggests something, it's less a suggestion more like ""if you don't do this, I won't respect you"". Runs hot and cold, so very unpredictable. Has irrational responses to situations he cannot control. Uses a coin or the i-ching to make any important decisions. Reduces everything that happens (on Earth) to ""mind"" (in a neo-advaita way), will tell you how he thinks you should look/dress in the form of unsolicited advice (though, he's ""honest"", so if you're the type who likes to ask how they look, he'll tell you), he desperately wants and needs someone but his attitude makes them all run away screaming (I have witnessed this).

It would be unfair to only list the terrible, ""undateable"" things about him. So these are the things that make him dateable (I guess), that I'd tell anyone to weigh up if they were considering him as a potential boyfriend: he is an amazing cook - he shows his care and love through cooking and looking after the other which seems contradictory to the above but he cannot express his emotions well, he works to have a good relationship with his children, he is a loyal friend (not just a control freak), if you can get past his defenses he is a very kind and gentle person but getting there is a trial by fire, he is a spiritual person (though this seems to cause more problems and conflicts than peace) but he thinks it will (dis)solve all his problems - which it won't, he is handsome, and his taste in music is more or less OK.

He is a good person, and I care for him dearly, being his friend means I've seen him warts and all. I think it's like with everyone else, he just needs the right person to come along.

Basically, we each have a room in a large old two level house, there is a shared kitchen and room downstairs, it has a television and some sofas. Nobody here is very social with others, we all just keep to ourselves. It's usually that only one or two people are around at any given time. On the rare occasion that I watch television, it's only me. Especially so for me and my sort of strange middle aged next-door-mate. 

When I had a BF, he would stay over regularly, and sometimes for multiple nights. Honestly though, I liked his place better, as he had no flatmates. Nobody cared, other people did the same thing. We were of course, quiet and respectful of others. I don't see how this would be a problem, BUT, in my situation we are all autonomous aside from our kitchen - we don't have to talk to each other about bills, I have a landlord for that. I could see how some could get annoyed about it (potentially) increasing bill costs. 

Perhaps just suss it out with a few of them, see how they feel. If they are reasonable they shouldn't be too bothered by it, or should be able to voice their concerns.

Anyway, I'm in my 30s, if that makes a difference:

It sounds like she loves you, that's not under question. But, it equally sounds like she is dealing with something in herself - which is not anything a relationship can fix. The ""fix"" has to come from her. Perhaps she wants you to know that she does see a future for you two, but she can't give the kind of energy or focus that is required to be in a relationship *right now*. I don't think she is ""thinking"" about what she feels about you, rather if she can *be* with you.

That being said, the choice is yours: you can choose to wait and love this person perhaps from a distance, because she cannot be with you at this time, or you could find that she does have what is needed in herself to be with you, or you could find that waiting is, as you said, not worth holding on for because it's not going to happen. Any choice is a risk, which you'll need to make if not only for love but also for yourself. What can you deal with? Do you have limits? Is this something that will require patience of which you have lots of? Perhaps it is designed to help you realise that with patience you'll get what you want.

I dunno, I'm speculating. Good luck.

username#00673,comment,2014-09-06 07:47:33,,"First, congratulations for seeking a therapist and trying to find a way to heal from your loss. It's very hard, but you will continue to move on and grow and you won't continue to feel guilty forever.

I can understand where you are coming from with some of this. I put off getting a divorce because I didn't want to deal with it. However, I had to think about where I was in life - I am in a totally different place than I was when married, and ownership of responsibilities. I don't live in a spousal role to my ex anymore, so it was really unfair of me to have put my divorce off. I can't be responsible or available should something happen to him and if something were to happen to me, he does not occupy a place in my life where I would want him to be the person making the decisions. I think to take full ownership of where I am today, I had to let go of what I wasn't anymore. It was the best for both of us.

It seems like you're uncomfortable with this, regardless, and you don't want to get really enmeshed in her life. You aren't obliged to give her the kind of time and support that you used to. That's because your relationship changed and with that so do responsibilities. That's a fair and healthy feeling. It's very hard to move on when someone is trying to keep you submersed in their day-to-day problems. Yes, you were together a long time, but for both of you, you should maintain your boundaries and say that you do care about her, but you don't think that you can be her support system anymore. It's keeping you from healing and moving on and Her too. You can't fill the role of ""husband"" anymore because it's no longer your role. She might get angry but it is in her own best interest to realise that she needs to start seeing you differently.

Please don't beat yourself up for not wanting to ""be there"" like you used to. On the other hand, it is crossing your boundaries for her to expect that you *should* be there. ",relationships

At this point (disclosure: I'm not engaged, duh, but have been married before), I just don't think I need a physical reminder (in the form of jewelry). Don't get me wrong, I'm a Libra and boy do I love nice things, but an engagement ring isn't one of them. There are so many other lovely beautiful reminders, I'd probably get a tattoo actually. I have other knuckle tattoos, but not on my ring finger.

He bought me a sewing kit. And you know, I use that thing all the damn time. It was the best gift ever. 
 I wouldn't ever criticise anyone else for wanting or needing an engagement ring though, and I am always super psyched to see my friends' and fawn over how lovely they are.

You really don't have a place in this, and you can't expect him to tell you it will be OK because *he* isn't OK in himself. You *will* lose him if you do not give him what he needs. Get some friends, hobbies, work more hours, do things that will make you happy and strong while he comes to terms with the end of something. It is very hard to watch someone grieve, and it is something that most people want to do privately.

He may even want to take time to go to her funeral, spend time with her family, mutual friends. He might want to cry and scream, and say out loud all the things he never got to say...and he needs to be able to do that without having to worry about making sure you're OK with it. These are the things that people need to do to get closure. Why would you want to be around if he is conflicted and devastated? He is no good to himself, how could he be a *partner*? This is what partnership is all about, letting go and letting them do what they need to do. That is showing him how much you love and respect him.

There are going to be all kinds of feelings and spaces that he will need to go through, and he was every right to ask for space. It's not personal, but you need to leave him alone.

You are right to be hurt and upset, but you also need to respect him, too. You can get through this, but you really need to let him grieve. It is a very personal thing, that he had the respect for you to ask for that time alone speaks volumes about him. I also hope that he is open to seeing a counselor or therapist to help him sort through the myriad of confusing feelings one goes through when experiencing such a loss. As far as your own feelings go, it is much better that he do this alone, because he will go through wondering if he is still in love with her, should he have broken it off, nobody will ever be better than her, memories and shared experiences they had together. Those are all things we run through in our minds when we have lost something, doesn't make them true, but it is much much better he process that without you around.

You might need to take a break from relationship or whatever you need to do to come to that understanding. It's not really about Sara, really, because your relationship if you went ""back"" to it, would still have the problems that caused it to end. You can't go home again, it wouldn't be the same anyway, think about how much you've changed and grown since you ended it. It's worth thinking about that too, how has ending the relationship allowed you to grow as a person? You spent a significant amount of time with this person. 

Crazy passionate love is just a stage of being in-love with someone. You can't force that stable dependable love on a new relationship. Think about when you met Sara, did you just straight up go into stable mature love? No, of course not (and shouldn't! you should experience all the stages of being in-love!!!), you had to share experiences and time for that to happen. If you sit and try to decide ""one or the other"" (a non-choice!) then no relationship will ever match up to the one you've created in your mind based on many years with someone. She of course knows you better, she was a long-term relationship. It sounds also that she has moved on with her life, that's why she is doing things. She sounds like she might be OK and you not so much. Maybe you think that getting back into her life might help you recapture something, but really it will just cease whatever growth she has and you could have. She most likely did know how you felt about her, you married her. Respect her growth and let her grow. Believe it or not, she might even fall in-love again. Let her. 

Coming into contact with her has brought up unresolved feelings. That's OK, but that is all they are, feelings. The initial instinct might be to run back, but to what? Even starting something new is a low possibility. Your new partner will never be Sara, and it is a disservice to her to try and wish she was. She is her own person in her own right - and you've kind of described her in a way that makes it seem like you don't respect her (you mention she has this and that and used to be a whatever...), she isn't a throw away person but it sounds like a mighty madonna-whore thing. You've kind of thrown your new partner under the bus because your feelings about wanting Sara have come up. Not...totally cool.

See a therapist or counselor if you aren't already. They will help make sense of your feelings and help you let go. It might not be immediate, and it might be hard, but the guilt or remorse and loss doesn't have to haunt you. ",relationships

During lunch, I had a friend (? I guess it was a friend, I can't remember who the girl was) show me a drawing she had done, I used my middle finger to point at something on the paper. She started with that thing that all kids do ""OOOOOH you're using your middle finger!!!"" and then some lunch monitor came over and gave me detention after school. 

As a 9 year old, I knew this was both insane and lacked completely in evidence. Nobody listened to my cries of injustice, so I served three hours of helping to clean up litter. After this, my life became more or less patterned after *The 500 Blows*.

username#00674,comment,2022-06-29 06:00:39,,"As a middle schooler, I was in a friend group of all girls with me being the only guy. Our group 5 people total so I was pretty close with the 4 girls I sat with at lunch everyday. Physically, at least. I was pretty shy as a kid, but in the ""I hate the world and everyone in it"" kind of way so even though we were all friends they often annoyed me and I wouldn't hang out much outside of school. 

The girls often fought with each other over things I didn't understand at the time but looking back was some real tumblr kind of stuff. (I have a vivid memory of one of them insisting she was OCD and when the leader called her out on her BS her explanation of why it was true was that asymmetrical things and messes made her self harm?) The leader was the girl I was friends with first, and I was the one who introduced myself to her and she was the one who introduced me to the others. I made friends with her because she was alone and bullied, soon after making friends with her I sorta picked up on why. 

She had little to no sense of boundaries and would constantly either be yelling in my ear or constantly poking me, touching me or trying to fight me. Which I've learned years later is kind of how young girls show their affections because they don't know how yet. I think the worst thing to have happened during one of our fights was when she tore my shirt off in front of a massive group of people both children and adults, then proceeded to cry in my mother's arms because she started her period and got embarrassed. Needless to say, I didn't end up telling my mom about the shirt thing since my friend was so upset. 

Another girl in the group once grabbed me from behind and whispered ""it's not rape if you like it!"" in my ear at one of the girls birthday parties.... I kinda went home early after that. It was jokingly and all but I was weirded out and didn't want to be around a bunch of hyper girls any longer. 

I'm an artist and have always been really creative, and I have memories of drawing little comics and cartoons of the girls harassing me because it was so common and played down by them that I genuinely thought that kind of treatment was just our personal inside joke.",AskMen

username#00681,comment,2022-08-21 16:12:57,,"There's a general perception of those having physical disabilities as automatically having mental disabilities as well. This shows up with individuals baby-talking or infantilizing those in wheelchairs, or moving them without their consent thinking they're so disabled as to be unable to speak or comprehend. 

There's also a perpetuation of the stereotype that severely disabled individuals are violent, aggressive, and can not be helped. Whenever there is an instance of a severely disabled person being aggressive, only the neurotypical person gets to share their side of the story with whatever context they like. 

When neurotypical individuals have drug problems, issues with violence, or destructive personalities as a result of trauma or abuse we are supposed to sympathize for them and help them. Somehow, that doesn't carry over to the severely disabled who are at a much higher likelihood to be victimized throughout their life. 

My brother is functionally non-verbal and will always be at the cognitive level of a child, and he has been victimized multiple times by people with authority over him. He had a teacher who knew of his sensitivity to touch and his compulsion to rub over areas where there had been unwanted contact, so she would drag her fake nails down his spine to scratch him knowing he couldn't reach the area and it would drive him to tears. He had another classroom where he had an upper body tic, and a group of aids took that as him attacking so they choked him and then threw him to the ground and pinned him there. They had their knees/legs pressed into his head, chest, and extremities. Then they sent him home on the bus all cut and bruised like they'd done nothing wrong. 

That's my brother. That's the kind of abuse a disabled person can face when they have a loving and supportive family looking out for them. 

I work as Director of Operations at a home care company and the amount of people who come in as workers who think negatively of the disabled is staggering. They think they are psychologically inferior, a rung below on the evolutionary ladder, inevitably abusive, and sometimes they don't even think of them as real people. 

The disabled community does not benefit from pity and inspiration porn, it benefits from genuine conversations and shifts in public perception towards understanding.",antiwork

username#00681,comment,2021-02-14 04:44:42,,"This is fascinating for me, as I feel learning about Autism from those with it might give more insight into how my brother feels. 

My brother has severe Autism (or Level 3 as I think it is now qualified) and after reading some of these comments, it feels like he has almost an entirely separate condition. There is, of course, the overlap with the misunderstanding of emotions and social interactions, and the like, but even those seem more severe for my brother. 

He is functionally non-verbal and only has rudimentary level communicative skills; in the over 20 years I've been alive with him, we have never had a conversation and, in fact, he's never even spoken in complete sentences. For the most part, he attempts repetition at what others say or tries to express himself in single words. As for his emotional responses, if there were any at all, they seemed to be almost cross-wired. For example, when in pain, my brother would smile and laugh--the more hysterical the laughter, the greater the pain. He will always be at a cognitive level of that of a 4-10 year old (it varies based on the subject and context). There is so much more to him, of course, but this is already so long a comment. 

Beyond all that, I wanted to say that my brother is the best person I have ever known. In spite of his limitations, he is clever, funny, talented, loving, and views the world with everlasting wonder. 

This thread does leave me with an interesting thought, though; one that I will share with no intention of offense. If it is at all offensive, please let me know and I will apologize. It is quite interesting to me that, on a personal level, Autism can only be described and explained by those whose severity allows them to communicate in some form. It is wonderful that we are now getting insight into Autism, without a doubt, but I wonder how it relates to those with Autism that cannot communicate at all. I wish I could hear the experiences from them, especially from my brother. In fact, there is nothing I wish more than to hear how my brother thinks and feels from his own words, from himself.",AskReddit

username#00688,post,2019-05-03 20:44:18,Adderall abusers and meth users are the same person.,"First off, I understand Adderall helps those with ADHD and I'm not saying all users are the same.

A bit of a rant here, sorry. Just so sick of it. I have seen multiple people lose their entire personality and become ticking time bombs. 

I live in a college town and Adderall/Vyvanse use is insane. Some use it to study, some use it to party and some use it to game for days. All these people eventually can't operate without the pills. It leads to serious rage issues and mood swings. 

My roommate spends around $300/month on someone else's adderall. Here are some facts:

- He will exhaust you with hours of pointless stories and ramblings then get mad when you don't listen. He literally can't shut the hell up. Just like a tweaker.

- He develops severe OCD. The other day I saw him spend 2 hours rearranging our decor for no good reason. He will fly off the handle if a stack of magazines isn't ""even"". He thinks he is being productive, but is really just wasting time. Just like a tweaker.

- He developed other addictions due to his Adderall use. He also requires Xanax to deal with the comedowns. When he is inevitably broke as shit, he will mooch off others to survive. Just like a tweaker.

-When he eventually runs out, everyone runs for cover. He will wake up after a 20 hour coma and start punching walls, throwing things and start talking about hating life. Just like a tweaker. 

These pills literally have the same chemical makeup as methamphetamine (or very close to it). I just think it needs to be taken a little more seriously. It is being handed out like fucking candy.

People think it is a ""miracle"" drug, but in reality, you are just a tweaker and should be seen as such. ""Productively unproductive"" is a great slogan for this drug.",unpopularopinion

username#00689,post,2020-09-29 12:42:52,Koalas are fucking terrible animals,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.",unpopularopinion

About a year ago I had developed a serious case of diabetic ketoacidosis, as a type 1 diabetic this can have about a 3% chance of killing you and this was the 5-6th time I had it that year 

I had a bad habit of not taking my insulin as prescribed mainly due to self harm, I had control over something finally so I abused it 

I ended up with my blood sugars in the high 40s (mmol, the Australian measurement not the American) and my ketones at about 5mmol 

I went to hospital thanks to my mother who found me pale and looking like a corpse in my own puke 

In that hospital I was in ICU for about a day or two where I was in a diabetic coma, the doctor had told me my heart stopped and my brain started to starve itself, if that continued I would have been unrevivable I woke up feeling a rush of good feeling I suppose in my body, I felt so healthy, 

is this what feeling normal is like? If I keep my blood sugars managed will this feeling stay? 

The answer was yes

Im not entirely sure how to word this in an easier to understand way without an infographic but for one, 330 million is nearly four times 83 million, and to top that off you have people not densely packed in a generally homogenous climate and climate, but with people over a continent wide country with varying landscapes and population distributions. You can go 
from San Francisco, and drive for literal days without seeing a single other person through a desert, then appear out in Austin and be in a huge dense city, then back to bumfuck nowhere and back into another city. There's no denying that the US has vastly more space and vastly more people with not enough hands to patrol it all domestically.

And to clarify, I'm not using the culture argument as a defense of our gun violence. I'm not saying that ""it's ingrained in our culture so let's not do anything about it"" I'm saying that because we as a nation since our inception we've held the right to bear arms in such high regard that now, later in the future where firearms have progressed past muskets, that cultural tie has extended from just bearing arms, to being a symbol of our freedom, as fucked up as it is. So now you have a huge nation with way more people who are now in a nation with more guns than people. We CANT ban guns or restrict them because there is physically NO CAPABILITY for us to make sure firearms can't reach someone's hands. 

That's why instead of focusing on limiting guns, we need to focus on making sure that the general population are better educated, and have a better support structure so that when things go awry, it doesn't lead to a shootout.

Tldr; firearms and their use in the United States has become so casual and accessible because of our gun culture that we've reached a point that we can't simply ban or restrict guns in any way, because there is simply too much. Too many guns, too much space, too many people. Instead of focusing on a near impossible solution, we should instead focus on a more attainable one. Most gun violence is from accidents, or mentally ill people. Thus we can drastically reduce firearm casualties domestically by increasing gun safety education, mental health and social welfare infrastructure. This will put us on a recovery path where soon enough Americans will understand the inherent danger of firearms and we'll be able to start cracking down and finally ban general firearm ownership. But we can't start with the guns, it will cause too many problems.",facepalm

And we're afraid of all the extra rules and laws and even further the lost taxes and revenue from firearms. It's absurd the hole the US has dug itself into with firearms. We're not going to make good progress on firearms control with our current political deadlock (bad choice of words but I can't find a better alternative) but we 100% have the capacity to focus on better mental healthcare and and social welfare.

You call it racist but what's actually racist is denying the hardships people of certain races have gone through throughout history, when people label themselves as X race we immediately have knowledge of the hardships their family has gone through and can agree that what they went through was horrible. Hardships from ones ethnicity can define a persons experience within a culture. Doing the opposite in my opinion is what's racist. Your example is as follows: ""Jews shouldn't call themselves Jewish in Germany because they're German nationals and it would be racist if they spoke about themselves as ethnically Jewish."" With your take, you're the one denying what races have gone through by denying them the ability to identify with their people who have gone through those hardships.",dataisbeautiful

When we first came here the first question that was asked towards us is ""where are you from?"" Now tons of generations later and several different ethnic group mass arrivals to make us one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world that question is still very important because it distinguishes your socioeconomic and historical place in this country, if you're X well then Y happened to your grandparents or great grandparents or parents or even you currently. It immediately tells about the individual and type of struggle that their family had to go through in a systemic multiracial culture, Europeans don't experience that, the most they experience is like polish immigrants or that one Ukrainian immigrant they know of. We literally walk in a sea of immigrants, 99.9% of us are descendants of only immigrants. If I ever dared to say I'm natively American I would get absolutely torched by native Americans so I have to come up with some answer to it and everyone who receives my answer knows I'm not saying I'm a citizen or even identify with that country of which I say my family is from. It just tells the history of my family within our shared country, that's it, nothing more. We don't care about your countries.

username#00698,post,2018-12-30 14:35:30,TIFU by harassing an innocent person from inside a mental hospital,"Not from today, you know the drill. 

I'm pretty severely mentally ill (schizophrenia, ocd, etc) and for a while I was receiving inpatient treatment at a psych hospital. I was heavily overmedicated and sedated 24/7, making me possibly not make the best life decisions.

Mental hospitals have little like, wall mounted phones there, bc you can't bring your own phone or anything. If you were planning on calling someone while inside? You needed to copy their number down onto a piece of paper and bring it with you when you get admitted.

So it'd been... 6? Days at the hospital, and I decided ""hey, I'm gonna call my buddy Andrew, let him know when visiting hours are, see if he wants to come by."" It's a solid plan, he's my good friend, it's all good.

So I call his number on the wall phone. It rings a few times, then goes to voicemail. Here's where the trouble starts. Andrew and I have this running joke between us. Whenever someone like... doesn't immediately respond to a text message, or a discord call request, or a phone call? We just insult and threaten each other. I know. It's really, really stupid.

So nobody picks up this phone, and naturally, instinct kicks in. The ""leave a message"" beep plays. I start talking.

""Andrew you fuck. You absolute fucker. I'm gonna skin you. I'm gonna skin your dick. I'm gonna skin your whole body starting from your dick. You absolute bitch. You better watch the FUCK out."" 

Beep.

This wasn't said, like, in a joking tone. The joke requires we sound seriously mad at each other, or there's really no fucking point, is there?

I decide I'll try again tomorrow.

Tomorrow comes. It's about an hour before visiting hours, and his house is abt an hours drive away, so I figure I should probably call him. I punch in the number (with a 9-1- in front to make it an out of hospital call) and hit call.

It rings for a lot shorter of a time this time. Voicemail sound beeps. 

(I honestly only remember what I said on the first one very clearly, so this is pieced together from bits of memories)

""You think you're funny? You think this is, this is some kind of joke? Am I a joke to you? I'm gonna make you wish they'd botched your circumcision. I'm gonna literally consume your balls. I'm gonna LITERALLY rip off your balls and like, cook them and eat them.""

""Oh, by the way, visiting hours are 6:00pm-7:30pm""

And then I'd hang up.

I was aware that all of my calls were being observed by staff at the hospital, but I was confident they'd know it was jokes.

Called one more time a day later. Literally no memory of what I said. Keep in mind, I was SEVERELY overmedicated. All I remember is that the call went straight to voicemail.

Few days later, called friend who actually picked up. Asked her why Andrew was ignoring me. She's confused and puts him on the line. I interrogate him.

The number I had written down for him. Was off by one digit. I had copied it down wrong.

I wind up calling wrong number one last time, a lot less aggressive this turn.

""Heyyy, I'm... I'm really sorry... about those threatening messages I left you... I thought you were, uh, a friend of mine, whose number is off by one digit. I uh... I swear I'm not a dangerous person, I... yeah, I'm sorry..."" and I hung up.

The guy I was calling. Could have looked up the number he's never seen before, that was sending him threatening messages over and over, and would have seen it's coming from a mental hospital. 

Tldr; I'm the scary mental patient the horror movies warn you about

I know this sounds like r/thathappened but in a bit (I need some sleep ) I'll post pic of hospital bracelet. Technically I can't prove the phone call thing but. it's something that i still cringe really bad over, so if you want to think it's a lie then you're welcome to, and I wish I could join you.",tifu

if a child, from birth, is at all times exposed to a constant tone that is always heard exactly the same (no fluctuation in volume, pitch, or other variables) will that consistent tone become their ""default"" ? As in, would they interpret the world with just that sound as silence?

Further-

If the answer to that is yes, what happens when we cut off that tone? Would it cause that person to ""hear"" in the same way that staring at a negative image makes your eyes see the full-color version when you look away? 

(I don't really know how to phrase it well, but I hope this makes _some_ sense as a I know theres not exactly an ""opposite"" when you're dealing with sound but maybe just, **low tone** => high tone, or **high tone** => low tone, etc.)

If that's possible, the next question would be- how much, exactly, can the human brain accept and adapt to? What if it wasnt one perfectly consistent tone? What if it was a simple repeating pattern or a basic tune, or what about rhythm? Take it up about 50 notches- what if it was Mozart? What about singing, or someone talking? Can a human mind interpret human speech (constant, consistent, but endless.) as silence?

Would they hear.... negative patterns, if you cut off the positive input? As in- If you stop playing Mozart, will the subject hear, like, ....forbidden anti-Mozart? Will they even be conscious of the music stopping? Are they aware that theres music at all?

:/

If silence is a learned concept, itd change a bunch of things. I'm just gonna jump into tinfoil hat territory here because its so much more fun and throw out a large-scale brainwashing as a potential use for a dystopia.

For a tiny bit more context, this kid had started this thing where we compliment the bus driver every day as we get off. I'm not sure what happened, but they got on each other's bad sides. Most of us sided with the kid, mainly because the whole thing was taken a bit too far. He didn't start yelling until she stopped the bus and forced us to wait for whoever she called for backup. We have a new bus driver now, and no other information was really given out.""_",PublicFreakout

Kid in the red shirt in ""[Crazy Lady at Skatepark]( video is _Blayson Fife_ who went on to kill an elderly man and rob him of his gun collection. He was charged with second degree murder and aggravated burglary at 19.

The gist of it: Blayson and another guy killed a gun collector in what's suspected to be a robbery gone wrong, then booked it with a bunch of guns and money, came back for more guns and more money, etc. Three teenagers provided them with shelter and a place to hide from police, then went on to actually help them flee the state. This ended badly, seeing as crossing state lines does not make you any less wanted for murder, and instead they were all charged as accessories.

[Here's one of the articles, if you want this explained better by someone who is not me]( 

If you still arent quite sure if you should believe any of this, [heres Blayson in another skating video posted to YouTube. Little older, little scruffier, but very recognizable & using his full name]( 
He didn't lose his love of skateboarding between starring in ""crazy lady"" and _just fucking murdering a guy_ which I guess is kind of impressive. Stay true to yourself and do what you love, I guess.

Theres a few moth species that actually can (and do!!) use their (armored) proboscis to [pierce the skin]( of living organisms, [for a drink that's ""straight from the tap""](

Known best for containing these ""vampire moths"", the genus Calyptra contains 17 species- at least 8 of which demonstrate these vampiristic tendencies. Best known of these goofy bastards is _[Calyptra thalictri]( 

Serving as a step up from their original feeding method (which was centered around piercing the skin of a fruit with their proboscis in order to drink the juice) it's been theorized that the males of these moth species are attracted to the blood as a food source due to its salt content (unusually enough, the blood drinking is exclusive to the male moths. Females live off of fruit juice and nectar.) 

All Calyptra moths are native exclusively to the Old World (southeast Asia, eastern Africa, China, Japan, India, and eastern and southern Europe) save for one, but that one species hasn't been observed vampirising anything more lively than a [strawberry](

A little bonus- while they're a little intimidating when you only see pictures of them biting people ([x]( they're also REALLY cute imo. They have great camouflage, [disguising themselves as little curled-up leaves](

I was weighed at the end of my stay and was at 207 pounds. As far as my diet was, I ate three meals per day with occasional snacks (cheese, yogurt, crackers, soda, etc). I had a lot of sodium and carbs. I also drank a very large amount of fluids. I was also not as active as normal. I didn't walk very much apart from occasional pacing. And as far as meds go, I'm on weight neutral antipsychotics and other meds without negative effects on weight. Is this weight all actual fat? My clothing still fits fine for the most part. And if it is fat, will I lose weight to where I am normally eventually if I go back to normal life? I usually eat around 1,800-2,000 calories and walk 15,000 steps per day. I'm pretty sure the number is accurate since it was from a hospital scale.

username#00701,post,2022-05-05 18:56:18,AITA for wanting to leave the Mormon church even though it would disappoint my family and I don't have any sort of religious trauma?,"This may be a dumb question, but I felt like I needed to ask.

Background: I was raised to believe in the Mormon church but it didn't quite work out. I never believed. I always saw the church as something that was never worth my time and even a cult. I was forced to spend a lot of time at church. I had to go to church every Sunday. I had to attend youth group activities every Wednesday. I attended church social events. I had to do a lot of church related stuff. Many things didn't sit right with me. Members were encouraged to fit a specific mold. Members have to preach to other people. I don't like their policies towards LGBT+ people. I don't like the fact that members need to give 10% of their income to the church. 

No matter how much preaching from my parents and time I spent with the church I couldn't seem to get myself to believe. Doctrine didn't stand up to logic and there was nothing there that really benefitted me. If you search through my post history deep enough you may find a post about a faith crisis posted on the Mormon subreddit. This was because there was a part of me that wanted to believe so I wouldn't be isolated from my family in some way. But in reality I didn't believe. I live in Utah where the church is pretty much everywhere. I'm transferring universities in a couple of years and I want to transfer out of state. When I leave I want to leave the church behind. After that I will try to get rid of my church records or something. 

But I've seen stories of other people leaving the church due to a really big reason like dealing with homophobia or some sort of bad treatment from members or being screwed over by the church in some way. But I didn't deal with any sort of religious trauma. 

Just a lack of interest in the ideology. I simply see no reason for me to follow that religion. The church doesn't have anything for me. And I felt a bit trapped having the ideology shoved down my throat my whole life and having to pretend to believe when I'm really an agnostic atheist. The second I leave Utah, I'm done with the church. 

But, the members have overall been nice to me and there is a thing in my ward (A ward is basically a congregation of Mormons. Wards are assigned based off geographical location.) where tithing (The money members are required to pay.) is used to help nearby people who need some sort of financial help. Thanks to them, I can afford therapy.

 I kind of feel like I'd be an asshole because I feel like by leaving I'd be turning my backs on my family and the people who have helped me through church stuff. 

So tell me Reddit, AITA?",AmItheAsshole
username#00701,post,2022-04-15 23:35:41,Why do I look heavier on some days but thinner on others?,"Sorry if this is a dumb question. There are some days where I feel and look heavier but my weight is the same as other days where I look smaller. This fluctuates across days or weeks. Is there an explanation for this? I am 185 pounds at 5'2 if that matters.

My weight has stayed around that number for a while. In general it doesn't go up or down.

Although I wonder if my perception of my body is more mental? My body always looks horrible to me even if others say I don't. I even feel guilty after eating food. I have gone as far as to starve myself some days and I tend to count calories a lot. Although I can't since I don't feel good after going without food for long amounts of time.

Reddit has given me unlimited access to memes, entertainment and gives me the feeling of having friends, but without actually interacting with people irl (I technically have a friend, but I haven't seen her for a while). 

I have discovered many subbreddits. From well known ones such as r/AskReddit, r/teenagers to the lesser known ones such as r/AntiVegan, r/blackholerevenge, or r/im14andthisisdeep. I have ran into all sorts of people such as incels, militant vegans, teenagers that stick their dicks in shampoo bottles, teenagers that fuck ropes, etc (I found some of them via PMs).

I have gotten silvers, 3 followers, and a bunch of upvotes and I am grateful for them. You may find this dramatic, but I like to find pleasure in small, good decisions. And Reddit is one of them. 

Thank you, Reddit for the joy I am given!

Feliz cinco de mayo, btw!

(cinco de mayo is a holiday that celebrates a victory Mexico had with France in a war and it isn't celebrated that much in Mexico even though it is a big deal in the US.)

Once again, Thank you to Reddit.

sincerely- u/Nerdiant.",teenagers

username#00701,post,2019-04-08 04:03:41,I haven't been feeling great lately.,"I have stopped cutting for a few months, but I have been starting to do it again. I'm not surprised considering I usually fail to stop. I haven't been feeling good emotionally either. I want to watch myself bleed a bit. I am conflicted. On one hand, I don't see it as a problem and it kind of calms me down. On the other hand, I don't want to be hospitalized for a third time. Although each hospitalization has been for different reasons.

I read about this guy who's friend comitted suicide and it triggered me a bit. I have been running out of options on how to self harm so now I weave a needle in and out of my skin and rip it out. It is very discreet so it will be harder to notice. It isn't deep, nor is it noticeable. I am sort of wanting to stop. I really don't want to face the consequences of harming myself.

I am also getting a bit sick recently because medication changes and periods don't mix too well so it may be the health stuff talking. I have been getting paranoid again and it is normal for me to be paranoid time to time, but it has been getting worse. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia a while ago and I was really paranoid when I had issues with it. Occasionally I worry about relapsing. I normally have the occasional bit where I hallucinate, but it normally passes. I have no reason to assume that I will relapse. I really want to hurt myself again and I am trying to fight the urge a bit. I have been trying to keep myself occupied, but I still think about it.

I also have been emotionally numb for several years, so I was only capable of feeling paranoia, depression, but I was numb most of the time. I am starting to feel emotion again and that gave birth to constant internal conflict on how to handle life. I may be getting excellent grades in school and I am being productive, but I have been hurting a bit more lately. Just for a few weeks, maybe a month.

It may be nothing in comparison to what goes on with you guys so I probably don't have the right to feel this way. I have also struggled with depression and social anxiety on top of schizophrenia before I got better. I am just scared that it will come back. I am in a much better spot than I was a year ago, although I have felt this way lately. I am also starting to worry more about my health.

I take two medications that have an interaction with each other that makes me at high risk for long QT. I build tolerance to medication quickly, so the medications for my mood and seizures are being increased. I also have Kayser-Fleischer rings and it is a sign of other medical problems. Before pms and my medication increase, I was doing fine. I also found out a month ago, that my grandpa has cancer and he is refusing surgery and I don't know how to feel about it (and no, I am not joking about cancer, this is serious)  because I have never gotten to know him and I have only seen him twice.

I am making healthy choices apart from cutting and it feels weird. On one hand, I am doing well and what I am feeling as I write this passes, on the other hand, the title and what I have said is happening.

I'm sure this is nothing in comparison to what stuff many people on this sub are struggling with. Sorry for the rant. I just had to get this off of my chest.

username#00701,post,2019-03-23 23:45:52,Game development is not going well story wise.,"So far me and a few other people from a subbreddit I was on decided to help me develop a video game. I had an idea, but it was too similar to Portal. I mentioned it on the sub and said that people that are ace don't have much representation in media. This translated into them suggesting a storyline where people survived a disease epidemic because they were asexual. The idea without it is just a robot war + epidemic of some deadly disease. I personally think it is not a good idea to mix such generic premises into one mash. 

The one that says they're an author came up with the idea of robot wars and I don't see it as very original. Especially since they shot down my original idea for being unoriginal. I told them that the character's sexuality isn't supposed to be a big part of it (they thought that was the game's purpose) and they complied, but if this is where the story continues to go, I don't know what I will do. Thankfully I have control over what happens so they won't get too crazy.

I feel like we could go somewhere better with this, but I don't know what to do with these people.",teenagers

If you don't know what that means, it means she will be looking at everything on the computer. Including which websites I go on. And keep in mind it won't matter if my web history deleted.

She will still be able to find it. I'm not scared because of the typical reasons teens don't like their history checks. It's just that I have looked up things that \*look\* very sketchy. For example: I was looking up stuff about hacking. I am looking it up because I am considering being an ethical hacker (someone who gets paid to hack legally) as a second career if I ever have time (as a consultant) and last time I mentioned the word hacking, she asked me how quickly I wanted to go to jail without considering I would want to do it legally.

I have searched for other things that seem sketchy with no context, and I am not sure if she will believe me considering I am known to carry a lot of secrets. I don't want her to take away computer privileges because I use my laptop for school. I always get the feeling she is suspicious of me.

It makes sense considering I hid stuff in the past, but the things she doesn't trust me for don't involve me breaking the law or hurting people. The main person that suffers from my secrets is me. I still have many secrets, but they are a lot safer than they were before. I obviously won't tell you my secrets here since I don't want hundreds to see them.

I don't feel like I'm doing something wrong, I just like to feel protected by my privacy. My mom is generally understanding, but I am still worried she will take it the wrong way. Now that I think about it, there is this one thing I search that's inappropriate, but I don't do it very often.

Any idea on calming down a mother after checking your search history?

username#00701,post,2019-02-13 01:10:05,AITA for not caring for a specific person?,"I used to have this ""friend"" who would do the following things:

\-Berated my whenever I didn't do what she said

\-Got punched because I accidentally blew snow in her face and I said sorry. She punched me really hard in the stomache because quote ""You didn't say sorry"". Her logic was that because she supposedly had good hearing, it was impossible for me to have apologized without her hearing.

\-Sat on me with my arm twisted behind my back and wouldn't get off until I agreed to give her an item of mine. (Joke is on her because her mom came to pick her up)

\-When I was having a depressive episode (she didn't know, but most people knew I was having a hard time without me giving specifics) she gave me a list of people who didn't like me and why.

\-When I called her out for berating me, she told me I was being a huge jerk to her.

\-She would blow up at me for little things. One day, I didn't notice she got her eyebrows done, and she yelled at me and stormed off. Another time this happened was when I messed up painting her nails by accidentally getting it on her skin. The results were the same as before.

\-She knew I had a lot of difficulty with social skills (I found out later that it was because of autism) and I asked her to help me, instead she yelled at me when I messed up.

\-When I was acting erratically during psychotic episodes (I have multiple mental health disorders, in this case schizophrenia) she accused me of doing it for attention and getting laughs out of people.

\-She would touch me without permission, even though she knows I hate being touched. That included sitting on me, ""play"" attack me and possibly the occasional slap.

\-She said she touched me without permission because she didn't know boundaries. I tried explaining it to her, but she plugged her ears, laughed, and walked off.

\-When we were kids she said I was a bad christian for believing in magic (even though she believes in Santa)

This is all I remember off of the top of my head, but she did more. Also, remember when I was having a depressive episode? Well she did some of this stuff when I was on the very edge, and that was just enough to motivate me to commit suicide. (obviously, I failed)

Months later she mentioned she cuts on her legs (even though in a swimsuit, she didn't have any visible cuts, although I could be wrong because I suck at making detailed timelines from memory). She mentioned depression. In the past she has told me a lot of people were mean to her, but they were pretty nice to her (I know this because she was always with me. We were in church,school and we hung out a lot. On top of that she lived right next to me). And we were together for several hours a week) Fast forward to late 2018. She takes my phone and goes to the notes app. She writes a thing saying she might be bipolar. She asks for advice. She said ""this nice lady"" told her she might be. She went into specifics about some of her issues. I agreed that those symptoms would fit (I have a slight idea about the disorder because my dad was bipolar) and I just told her to get professional help and take care of herself. I didn't really care, I was just confused and wanted her to leave me alone. She told everyone in YW (young womens, it's a thing mormons do) my ward (church community) that she had depression. I didn't doubt this, but I felt suspicious.

If something she did to me was ever mentioned, she would say she changed. It would be nice to believe this, but I found out that around that time, a mutual friend hung out with her as much as she used to with me. That friend got transferred to another school because she was bullied by someone. She also tried to get me to give her my number (I said no) and kept sitting next to me in church for a while (she stopped in early 2018). Don't get me wrong, I don't hate her. I used to, but I realized hatred only hurt me so the hatred withered away. I have a similar attitude with her to most people: not liking, nor hating her. The difference is, I have lost the ability to care completely and I have no interest in having a relationship with her again. I am willing to help her as long as nothing on my part is at stake. AITA for cutting her out and not caring?

edit: Thanks to her, my social anxiety (which I had before) got worse because I am always afraid of people blowing up at me and I relive memories of that at night. I don't really care about her due to the pain she has caused me.

edit 2: By take care, I mean self care. As in exercising and eating right. And don't do anything to harm themself.",AmItheAsshole

username#00701,post,2019-02-03 23:00:22,The guy who stopped at nothing to defend his tomatoes.,"I thought I would share to this subbreddit because I couldn't find any place for this to fit.

This guy, who we will call Calvin, had neighbors he really hated (the feeling was mutual). They would do everything from calling him racial slurs (even though they were both white), vandalizing his house and other stuff. He tried to get them in trouble, but their parents refused to believe that they could do anything wrong. The last straw was when they started sneaking into his yard and stealing his tomatoes (which he put in a lot of effort to grow). That was not ok with him. He ended up making caltrops, which is a small sharp device made for stopping vehicles or at least making it harder for them to move. They were used in WW2 according to Calvin. He put them all over his yard and keep in mind these aren't the first traps he put in his yard. His neighbors apparently have come to his yard before. He kept the location of all of the traps in a notebook. Unfortunately, he lost the notebook. He kept the traps for a while and avoided his yard. His mom ended up making him find and get rid of all of the traps. He didn't know how to approach this, so he ended up walking around the yard and stepping on ALL OF THE TRAPS. Needless to say, he ended up getting a tetanus shot. To be honest, I am not even sure if traps stopped them, but if I remember correctly, his neighbors didn't go into his backyard that much anymore. I am not sure if it was the traps though. This isn't the only thing he did (or almost did) to get revenge on his neighbors. Someone in the group of kids I was in said, ""You must really like tomatoes"". Calvin said he actually hated tomatoes. That means he did all of this for the sake of revenge. You may call this fake, but if you knew him, you wouldn't be surprised if he told you this. Keep in mind I didn't see him be sarcastic for more than a couple sentences, so I know he was serious. If you want to hear about the other things he did, I might make another post.

Now that I think about it, I will post this to r/ProRevenge. I hope you guys enjoyed this story. Calvin, if you have Reddit and you are reading this, not only would that be awkward, but know that there is a subbreddit called r/myevilplan for getting revenge on your neighbors. Enjoy.

edit: He stepped on the TRAPS not the tomatoes. Although I wouldn't be surprised if he did that later.

edit 2: He left the traps out for a while before stepping in all of them and now that I think about it, his neighbors stayed out of his yard for a bit.",teenagers

username#00706,comment,2011-09-18 15:42:23,,"Okay, I'll try and be more helpful. Realize what things you have control and realize what you don't. Luckily, you live in a era where we can afford to get our noses done but you should work on a few other things first...


(1) You're hair is too plain, try going a week without washing and see how it turns out, girls like tussled look


(2) Show more emotion in your face, it's okay not to on this subreddit but I'm willing to bet you emit this face more often then naught in person. The more you over express yourself (without being immature) and show emotion, the more appealing you are as a person.



(3) Apple Cider Vinegar, Buying 11 pillow cases switching them out eery night, anti-biotic, w/e to mitigate the acne until you grow out of it.



(4) My parting advice is, get a job during the summers, don't spend money on stupid shit like 100 dollar shoes or impulsive food buying, save it up for a rhinoplastii, talk to a lot of doctors, not just one, ask for opinions. You're face can still change drastically as you grow older. You can help it change for the better by inducing exercise like weight lifting (testosterone will change shape of your face.) Estrogen is on the rise within youth (srs) look it up, it's because of plastic products with BPA. Look into supplements like DIM to combat that, avoid plastic products.


Also, if you are short, google this, Niacin Growth Studies, cycling Niacin with Melatonin can help you grow a good 2-3 more inches (srs.) I wish I knew about this when I was young, I'm 6'2"" but I'd kill for massacre an entire civilization of pygmy people if I had 2 more inches.",amiugly
