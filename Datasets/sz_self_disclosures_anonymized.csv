username#00390,post,2023-11-08,My mother wishes she had schizophrenia,"I swear my mother has munchausen syndrome but never been proven. She always has some problem apparently but never a diagnosis. Today she was getting her memory tested and in the middle of her telling me I started having some hallucinations and I just casually acknowledged it like ""oh welp I'm hallucinating a bit right now"" and she was saying how her doctor asked if she ever has hallucinations and she said ""I told her no, I don't think so but I wish I did"". This pissed me off so much. For one, when she first learned I have schizophrenia she tried to downplay it and said she sees hallucinations out of the corner of her eyes sometime which nearly everyone does and my symptoms are much more than hallucinations and much more intense than shadows at times.

I've told her the horror stories of having this mental illness. All the ways in which it makes my life so much more difficult and often it is terrifying. I've never said a positive thing about it yet she says she wishes she had it basically. I said sorry you don't get to see happy fun scenes. My brain personally picks out my biggest fears and disgusts and makes me hallucinate them with all my senses. It's never fun for me although I've had maybe 3 in years that were kinda cool/interesting but lasted less than a minute and I never told her that. 

She disgusts me. It's so insensitive and overall she is an awful mother for many more reasons but I thought maybe some of you can unfortunately relate to this kind of comment. I've heard it once before but I just figured that person was ignorant about schizophrenia as I didn't know them well but my mother has heard all the horrible things I go through and made a comment like that. She wants to be sick so bad and it frustrates me because so many people are ill and suffering and would give anything to be so healthy.

Thanks to anyone who read my rant. I really needed it today.",schizophrenia,i have\s*(schizophrenia); i have\s*(schizo),X
username#00391,post,2023-12-26,Schizophrenia and archons or demons,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago. But what triggered it was religion, specifically Christianity. 

First it was mostly a pleasant experience. I had been emotionally numb for years, but after believing in Christianity I got my emotions back. I even cried tears of joy/beauty, which was something I had never experienced before. 

Then things turned more interesting when I prayed for the gift of speaking in tongues. It's when Christians speak fluent gibberish. I started to have supernatural experiences, and felt like god was communicating with me directly. I felt all kinds of nice emotions and feelings.

But then I did something which wasn't pleasing to ""god"", and things turned very negative. I felt this feeling of terror and felt my soul being torn from my body. This entity made me believe I had done what's called the ""unforgivable sin"" or blasphemy of the holy spirit.

All the nice feelings stopped, and I felt an evil presence. Then a day or so later, I had some vivid hallucinations. It felt like god had left me and demons were entering me, and were going to take over me and force me to do bad things.

This drove me to attempt self-termination. But I was unsuccessful. After this I was sent to a mental hospital.

There this entity contacted me through my mind. First it tried to goad me into doing bad things, but when I refused, it switched gears. It tried convincing me it was the Christian god, and I believed it because it could read my mind, enter thoughts into my mind and even move my body parts.

I was under this delusion for around 6 months and ""served god"" during my stay in the mental hospital. I had more ""supernatural"" experiences. Once I got home, through a chance encounter on a message board I discovered that this entity wasn't god, as this encounter proved it wasn't all-knowing.

But then it continued its manipulations. It now said it was a demon, but then it also pretended to be a different entity which was ""god"". To sell me this delusion, it made me feel some of the emotions and feelings I felt from before the self-termination attempt. I hadn't felt those feelings in around 6 months, so I believed that god was still with me, but that I was demonically possessed or oppressed, or something.

This delusion continued for 2-3 years or so. During that time I prayed probably hundreds of times to god and asked hundreds of other Christians to pray for me, but received no answers to my prayers. At least nothing that was consistent beyond chance. It was almost like I could pray for the sun to rise tomorrow and it would be dark.

Then in May 2023 I started to question whether Christianity is even real. So I critically studied the bible without always giving god the benefit of the doubt. I concluded that the god of the old testament was a genocidal psychopath and Jesus didn't disavow any of his actions. Also Jesus made prophetic predictions in the new testament that failed, such as predicting that he would return before some of his disciples had tasted death. I eventually concluded Christianity is not real.

But the demonic entity didn't just vanish, it's still there and tries to convince me that Jesus is god on almost a daily basis. It also enjoys it when I suffer or fail in life. It laughs and smiles when bad things happen to me.

Sure, it could be just schizophrenia and the medications I am using seem to get rid of the hallucinations. But this entity can still communicate with me in my mind, cause me to feel feelings, and it can move my body parts. It also doesn't fit the typical symptoms of schizophrenia. I am not paranoid, I don't hear audible voices, I come off fairly normal to other people and so on. It's like some entity, a second personality, is living in my mind and trying to manipulate me through my thoughts.

Anyway, I am wondering if this could be an archon or something that has taken it upon itself to use me as its plaything? What do you guys think?",EscapingPrisonPlanet,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X

I suffer from schizophrenia, which I did not know till a few months ago, and the PDD really changed how bad it was. I had no choice I really needed help. Even though I had help it's like it's shameful to talk about. I am still trying to get over this idea that PDD should be a hush hush topic. After dealing with all that it really makes me sad to see how people treat any type of mental problem. It's like if I broke my leg obviously I would need it fixed, but when it comes to PPD and stuff it's like a don't ask don't tell policy.

At night I would hear full conversations outside my door about how someone is plotting to arrest me or how I should go back to sleep.

username#00400,post,1614883538.0,Sharing psychotic experiences with my dad,"My dad and I have had a strained relationship for years. He used to physically and emotionally abuse my older sister and I when we were very young, and I haven't felt safe around him my entire life. We have a much better relationship now that we don't live together, but it's still pretty draining to be around him.

Over the summer, we went to see a film about schizophrenia (Words on Bathroom Walls - loved it) and he said it seemed familiar to experiences he had. Eventually, over the course of many months, he finally opened up enough to tell me that he's been experiencing psychosis for most of his life and doesn't have ways to cope with it. As far as I'm aware, I'm the only one in the family who knows. I think he felt more comfortable telling me because I have schizophrenia and am quite open about my psychosis now.

On the one hand, I feel a little bit silly talking to a man three times my age and giving him the ""baby's first psychosis"" talk about how he's not alone, he's 100% justified in his feelings of fear, and that there are options for help that don't simply involve medication. I'm also kind of frustrated that he's only starting to address his mental issues now. I really could have done without a father who became a violent alcoholic in an attempt at self-medicating when I was a toddler, you know? I wish he had put himself first and took care of himself as opposed to trying to hide everything, letting it all build up, and then taking out his frustrations on his defenseless family. 

Yet on the other hand, I'm grateful that he finally became comfortable enough to tell me, and I know how hard that feels. I want to support him in his efforts to heal and become a better person, and I'm glad that I do have the experiences and know-how to help guide him through whatever process his recovery takes. I hope that he can start finding peace with himself and his experiences, and it may be a long, uphill battle, but this is a good first step. I will try to be optimistic and support him with whatever he needs.",schizophrenia,i have\s*(schizophrenia); i have\s*(schizo),X

username#00402,post,2017-04-24,How do you climb back out of a hole?,"I feel like I'm stuck in a hole that I can't climb back out of.

It's gotten to the stage where I'm in my room every single day. I live with two of my university classmates. I'm avoiding them as much as possible. They know I have schizophrenia but they don't understand it. One of them keeps making stupid comments about articles she's read online about it. Things like ""it's actually demons possessing us"" or ""the doctors obviously know more than you do"" etc. 

When I do come out of my room they feel the need to comment on everything I do. ""You're always in your room"", ""I've never seen you cook a meal for yourself"" etc. I don't know I feel like they're toxic at times. I just feel constantly judged to be honest.

Anyway I'm just eating babybell cheese, sometimes slices of cold meat from the supermarket, pot noodles, can of tuna. I barely wash my clothes.  It's been this way since I moved away from home almost 3 years ago. I've never been good at looking after myself. Sometimes I do cook, I know how to it's just finding a shred of motivation. I find shopping for food overwhelming. The expiry dates, the prices, the supermarket environment. 

I don't know guys I'm considering supported housing once my contract ends here in August because I really just want some help with this stuff so I can hopefully be able to do it myself. I just want someone to look after me for a while because I've tried so long to do it myself and nothing changes.

username#00410,comment,2024-02-07,,"firstly, i want to say that you would have better luck posting this on r/SchizoFamilies. it is a subreddit for the loved ones of schizophrenic-spectrum people to have a place to discuss and support one another through the sidelines of our condition.

secondly, i want to politely say that it may be important to reconsider how you view this friend. 

schizophrenia isn't something that is usually sudden and onset. it begins with small oddities in behavior (the prodromal phase) emerging into full psychosis (active phase) and hopefully attenuating with time (the residual phase). i personally have struggled with it for years (since childhood), and there are friends (who i've also grown up with) that still do not know. 

one of the consequences of sharing is that it changes how other people see you both interpersonally and on a systemic level (much like your post).

when i tell people that i'm schizophrenic, it's not an invitation to view me differently or wear gloves when interacting with me or walking on glass. it's something that informs the nature of my decisionmaking process and gives a bit of reason to my (appearingly) reasonless actions and behaviors-- but not something that necessarily excuses how i treat others or my responsibilities.

it's also, in my opinion, not an invitation to transcend the boundaries of our friendship and start asking relatives or my partner questions. 
what if those people don't know yet? that loss of volition in informing people on my time and comfort would be grounds to end a friendship entirely. 

*how* has your friend's personality changed? is it possible that she just feels comfortable enough to stop masking near you? is it possible that she has reasonably changed *beyond* her diagnosis in the year or so between the two of you talking? i am not the person i was a year ago. my entire life has changed in that timeframe-- i have broken free of a dissociative stupor that took years of internal work and that same ""in my own world and difficult to talk to"" phase. it even came with nifty selective mutism that made it even harder to connect with my loved ones and health professionals. 

what exactly unnerves you? is she violent in any of her positive symptoms such as psychosis, or does she harbor any thoughts or desires that could bring you harm with regards to delusional thinking? she sounds as if she has mostly negative symptoms, meaning that things have been taken from her or the concept of who she was before her diagnosis. flat affect, social withdrawal, anhedonia, alogia/mutism, so on so forth.  it's enough to just be there for her when she blows through town, or you can be as close as is reasonable for her symptoms (which of course change with time). 

it's completely reasonable to create some distance if you're unnerved or somehow burdened emotionally by being near someone in that stage of their development-- but if she's anything like me, the diagnostic stage & taking it beyond my head and into the 'real world' was the stage of my existence where i was absolutely the most unnerved and scared. 

i hadn't learned how to not scare people yet; how to stare at their eyebrows when i was dissociating so they knew i was an active member of the discussion, how to force noises out of my catatonic body to let them know i was there, how to *not* say stuff that scared them, even if it scared me too (which is why i was desperately trying to convey it at times in my word salad!) 

sorry for the bighuge rant, but i figured i'd give you some insight from the other side and drop the sister sub referral. 

i always like to tell people to give the book [The Center Cannot Hold by Elyn Saks](https://www.amazon.com/Center-Cannot-Hold-Journey-Through/dp/1401309445) a spin, both schizophrenic and those not on the spectrum.

username#00411,post,2015-03-04,I want to kill myself because I have schizophrenia,"I've become completely disabled ever since my first psychotic episode. I can't go to school, have any relationships or enjoy life. My behavior is extremely bizarre and disorganized (making animal and vehicle sounds, loud singing, screaming obscenities), which causes conflicts with my family members, to the point where my mom told me that the day I will die will be the happiest day of her life. My family members clearly don't love me, and I doubt I would be missed by any of them if I was to kill myself.


I always wanted to become a physicist and contribute to the field of physics, but now that I have schizophrenia, I can't. The cognitive impairment it causes, along with the negative symptoms and psychosis make it an impossible task to go to school and study to become one.


All my dreams and hopes are lost because of schizophrenia. Chances are, I will lead a miserable and poor life on disability, in and out of hospital. Why shouldn't I kill myself to end all the suffering? I'm already planning how I will do it. And no, this isn't just a ""temporary problem"". Chances are, it won't get better.

I've done it before and I'll do it again, here and now to be clear. Schizophrenia has a lot of stigma and misinformation about it floating around, manifesting as ignorant jokes, with automatic shunning, and in general there's a lot of ignorance about what it means. I'm schizophrenic. It's episodic, which is typical. So while many of us are able to blend in with a crowd, and I certainly don't come out to everyone I interact with, it's only because of the commonly held misconceptions about my condition that I stand by a discretionary principle of need-to-know.

username#00420,post,2023-06-10,Does anyone find their voices controlling?,"Like in the cartoons when a ghost takes over someone and they don't have control. 

I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia btw. But there are some things that I won't disclose that the voices make me do. Like they take control of my body and I just get to sit and watch through my own eyes the negative things they do. 

I'm in hospital at the moment due to the voices but yea with speaking with the docs and having them asking the right questions I've begun to understand ""hey it's not me that's doing these bad things"" and I feel so guilty afterwards too. Like I feel like I did these things because my physical body did do these things but I had no control. 

An example that shouldn't be triggering is gambling. A few nights back (been in hospital a week so this was whilst I have been in hospital) I gambled half my gov paycheck away and it wasn't until I got a message that I snapped back to reality and told the nurses. Had it not snapped me back I'd have continued going. Another example that shouldn't be triggering is at midnight last night (this has been the scariest) my body whilst I was concious just went we are buying cigarettes. Didn't have my phone or wallet. Didn't know if there was anywhere I could buy cigarettes. Didn't know if there was anywhere open to buy cigarettes. But it wasn't until I went to open the door and it was locked that I snapped back to reality and went oh shit.

There's much more embarrassing examples but I have attempted to be non triggering in my examples. Apologies in advance if this has triggered you as, 1 I didn't mean to, and 2 I recently learnt about verbal/written boundaries since being in hospital. Ie I know physical boundaries like don't touch people etc. But never been taught verbal and written boundaries could be triggering. Especially in a mental health ward. 

Yes we are allowed our phones but I have surrendered it voluntarily each time I get the inkling to gamble or do the more embarrassing things. 

So yea basically does anyone else experience this uncontrollable but concious experiences. Best way to describe it is like the ghost cartoon example I said earlier in the post and something snaps me back into my own body again.

I never got the closure I needed from the death of my friend. It was such a shock to me I refused to believe he was really gone, I went over to his house, I spammed his chats, I kept replaying his lasts audios over and over again because I am not at all ready to let him go.

Yesterday, I was sitting on the backseat of my car, crying. I was completely alone. I buried my head in my hands and screamed. When I raised my head, I saw him staring back at my from the front seat.

He looked the same as I last saw him. He smiled gently at me. The last thing I saw of him was his smile, his death was such a shock to everyone. He had shown no signs and told no one he was in such a dark place.

He apologized for not saying goodbye, and engaged in a peaceful conversation about death before bidding farewell and leaving. I couldn't say anything, I regret not saying anything. I wish he was still here. I wish I could've saved him.",SuicideBereavement,diagnosed\s*(schizophrenic); diagnosed\s*(schizo),X
username#00427,comment,2023-08-13,,"So I’m diagnosed schizophrenic and I have experienced things like this when I was in psychosis. I’m at the point where I think it’s a combination of mental illness and spiritual entities. This might be mental illness, it might be occult stuff. If you ask me it sounds like neither of those entities should be in your house and may get validation of their existence in your mind the more you pay attention to them. The Bible might be the best bet in fighting these things. Just my two cents. Nothing from the occult is holy and only Jesus has authority to cast out demons if I’m not mistaken. These could very well be demons in disguise. But like I said it could all be mental illness. Sage is occult and all that new age stuff is occult and demonic in eyes of the Bible. I use to be in to new age stuff until I started experiencing demonic attacks and hearing, personal, voices and nothing new age could even start to affect them. Until I was turned on to Jesus then I began to have a fighting chance. That’s what worked for me at least. There’s power in Jesus’ name and even demons tremble at just the utter of his name. Sounds like demons man. Terrible things what they do to the mind. Maybe talk to a psychiatrist as well and tell them what you experience.

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2018 but since 2012-2013 I've had delusional thoughts and psychosis. I've been in the psych ward twice. Once in 2016 and almost exactly a year later in 2017. Before my stay in 2016 I had an unexplainable out of body experience and total psychotic break.

I was wondering if anyone has experienced what I've called ""The Spin."" It is a total perception break  where whatever I look at goes through a sequential pattern of colors. It goes in order of the rainbow. e.g. I'll look around the room see a red water bottle, then an orange pillow. I'll panic a little and try an look away but look right at a yellow post-it, then a green plant an so on through the colors. I also go catatonic or can't stop my movements. During my spin in 2016 it was so intense that it felt like a roller coaster or if you have seen the doctor strange movie, it was like his trip through the mind/astral realm at the beginning of the movie.

From what I read schizoaffective-depressive type would be if I have had at least a two week period of psychosis without mood symptoms which I have had. So I guess my question is how do you separate schizoaffective from schizophrenia and depression, especially if that depression stems from the fact that I have schizophrenia? Am I just overthinking this? Is it just a technicality regarding labels that just don't matter or is this something I should ask my psychiatrist about? I'm already being treated with both antipsychotics and antidepressants, so does it really matter at the end of the day what I call my disorder(s)?",schizophrenia,i have\s*(schizophrenia); i have\s*(schizo); diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X

I think, I have depression. My psychiatrist didn't tell me that I'm schizophrenic in 16 y.o. after I left a psychoneurological dispensary. 
I don't take shower for a long time. (It's longer than a half year.) Few weeks ago I started cleaning my teeth regularly. May be I'm just a lazy ass. I can't cry. I want to fall asleep and don't wake up. I think about suicide. I attempted suicide a couple of years ago.
I take Amitriptyline again. Can take it for 6 month with a breaks. Psychiatrist is a unconversable man. He is the only specialist in my town. I just said I'm very sad and sleep bad and he told me to take Amitrptyline. I have nightmares because of these pills.

I try to learn Japanese and learn how to draw. But I don't see progress. I regret wasting time on this, regret spending money on a tablet. When I see someone's success in these hobbies it triggers me. I'm happy for people who draw well, who learn better, but I'm envious. Sometimes I'm avoid speedpaints on Youtube.

I found two great psychologists. One woman is a clinical psycholigist, she practises CBT. Her price is very good but I live only on a disability pension and save these money for a trip to m*scow to meet a friend. Video calls or texting to her scare me. Is session with a psychologist urgent? I don't even know if it will help me. I don't have support from my parents and siblings. And I don't need it from them. I think they need more support than me.

I am SO glad you spoke out and got help about this, and you should be so proud for doing that. Most people with psychosis don't have insight and don't seek help until someone else calls emergency services for involuntary treatment.

While psychosis can be terrifying (particularly the hallucinations and delusions), you are not alone! 
As someone who experiences psychosis frequently, I recommend trying to find things to ""ground"" you in reality. Maybe run your hands through water, focus on the feeling. For me, i would watch people talk and laugh on YouTube which would ground me but I would also look outside my window and watch cars go by. 

As for anger, it can be uncontrollable during psychosis for me! Try mindfulness (as this REALLY helped me and was recommended by my psychologist). There are a lot or resources online on how to practice mindfulness.

I find that my tendencies make me stronger in empathy and compassion, and for areas that I struggle with, I see a challenge for personal growth... It is fucking excruciating and hard, but I am coming into myself as someone I am proud of. It takes personal growth, medication, and a stable and fulfilling life.

username#00454,comment,2022-08-12,,"I find not many coping mechanisms work, and the ones that do, don't always, but distraction from the psychotic symptoms generally helps. Sometimes games can distract me, or music, or drawing, but sometimes none do. Then I just call mom over and ask her to keep talking, as I find listening to a real person's voice soothing. Or I'll hug my cats. I find that feeling a living thing breathe is consistently helpful unless I'm paranoid about them specifically. If mom isn't available I try to get on a discord call with someone that knows what's going on, or if that fails too I like to watch Jacksepticeye's old videos. There have been moments, though, where instead of distraction, releasing the thoughts and feelings was better. Talking to someone about it or writing it all down may help. Any combination of these things could help or make things worse at different times, but especially sound or touch stimulus may scare me more, though I think that's due to being autistic too.

As for symptoms, hoo boy they've been all over the place. I don't remember most of my actual episodes, but 3 stand out. 1 I was seeing demons and thought they were going to kill me. Another I was so terrified of everything that I wanted to kill myself to escape. That's the one that made me start medicine. Both of those I had some degree of awareness of what was actually going on, and was able to talk to mom about it and figure out what would help in that moment. The suicidal one I wound up just sleeping it off after getting mom to make the old man put his guns in the safe. The last I kinda just curled up rocking and crying on the couch. I thought the cats were some sort of giant mechanical beasts that physically couldn't fit into a cat's body, and that mom was a scientist or doctor or something and was controlling them. I thought if I said any of that to her she'd have them attack me. I think that's the only time since knowing I'm schizophrenic that I just lost all touch with reality. 

For paranoia about being watched: this sounds weird, but it's actually helpful for me to know that it's absolutely possible I am being watched in this era, and consider 'who would bother with me specifically though, out of everyone out there'. I do understand that'd probably make most people worse though...sorry if it bothers you. I almost always am experiencing some sort of hallucination, but it's usually nothing more than annoying. Figuring out if it's real or not is about all I can really do for it. The most common auditory ones are hearing a tv being played in another room or ambulance sirens in the distance. The tv one is honestly irritating. Even growing up I pretty much always had it and would sleep with a fan on, on high, because of it. I also hear dishes clanking, the toilet lid being closed, or my name being called. Visual ones used to mainly be shadow animals, that got bigger with time until it was mainly panthers. Now I see patterns and shapes of light, or sequences of letters and numbers, in the walls and ceilings.

On a last note, I have one major trigger for psychosis, and it's whispering. When people whisper I get very mad very fast, start hallucinating, and want to harm both myself and others. Unfortunately, most people are assholes that will do something more if you ask them nicely to stop, and find it funny when you freak the fuck out.",schizophrenia,i'm\s*(schizophrenic); i'm\s*(schizo),X

username#00457,post,2019-12-05,Dr and psychiatrist clashing cause of unmet needs,"Hey all, was hoping to get some advice on issue.

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia after my last hospitalization, and for 3 years before the diagnosis I was thought to just have psychosis as a symptoms of my PTSD. My Dr. believes that my schizophrenia is disabling and thinks I should apply for disability when I no longer can be on social assistance (I'm currently an independent youth, so I get gov. help since I don't have parents, will end in aug) but my psychiatrist is very against the idea of labeling a youth's mental illness as debilitating, and is kind of still stuck in the mindset of my previous diagnosis. 

When it was thought to just be trauma based psychosis she said it would mostlikely go away once I started trauma therapy, medications wouldn't help much cause it's trauma based, and that it's not life altering, but now I have a different diagnosis and I feel like she's not growing with me.

I am unable to leave my apartment due to fear and paranoia, I can't concentrate well so when I am taken outside by my worker they have to keep me close because I have accidentally walked into traffic 3 times now, my verbal communication skills are awful and it takes so long for me to write clearly and think, and my hallucinations are getting pretty bad. I don't even trust my own thoughts or suspicions at this point cause I don't know what's real and what my head making up. 

She now says I can't start meds because my delusions make it too difficult (I know I have a problem staying on meds but I want to try and fight) and she just dismisses everything I say or feel because she says don't know what I'm thinking or feeling because I'm schizophrenic. She makes me feel so bad, and my Dr and her fight over everything and I feel like it's such a battle just to get her to hear me when I say ""I don't feel like you're listening to my needs"" cause all she does when I say anything is say ""you're just paranoid"". I feel so full of anxiety when I have to go see her and I've started having really bad thoughts about her and the hospital working against me, her not putting me on meds cause I've already tried the ones she can profit allot on and she only cares about money, ect and I know they probably aren't real thought but it makes me frustrated and afraid of her. 

Her and my Dr always fighting is making me really afraid of medical people and I just don't know what I should do about this. Am I being sensitive? Is my psychiatrist in the wrong? How do you guyd get people to understand that your feelings are real when they say they're just your schizophrenia?

username#00464,comment,2022-03-17,,"I think it was actually very necessary and beneficial for me to seek a psychiatrist.

I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but it took me a grueling, awful year to seek 'professional' help. I already knew what I had, but one of my delusions was that psychiatrists were part of the government entity that would crash the world once I said that I knew I was their experiment. So once I explained my symptoms and the psychiatrist seemed to want to help, I felt a lot less anxious.

But I was misdiagnosed at first.

The hallucinations and traumatic experiences I've suffered during highschool made me depressed, so they wanted to label me as bipolar psychotic or something. They wanted me to go on antidepressants and anti psychotics. 

They didn't seem to understand that my 'manic' and 'depressive' episodes were stemming me desperately trying to seek relief from imagining myself alone under a bridge with uncontrollable schizophrenia.

Nevertheless my symptoms became more manageable, but we had to try several different medications. In the end I stopped trying meds because the symptoms would always be awful.

Just improving my life overall has led me to being able to manage my condition a lot better, and I hope to continue to be able to be off meds forever (:",Antipsychiatry,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X

username#00475,post,2019-01-03,Why I Hate the Poop Emoji,"Four years ago I was a sophomore in college. The summer before, I had attempted suicide by overdosing on Xanax. Many times leading up to that winter I had blacked out with benzodiazepines and alcohol. Sometimes it was intentional. Eventually, I started getting messages from myself, instructions to black out then open an envelope. One day, I had instructed myself to commit suicide. I even had a liter of 180 proof alcohol ready for me to drink, along with a number of drugs. Uppers and hallucinogens. So I took them all, along with the liter of Everclear, and played my favorite songs in my headphones while I waited to die in a bathroom. I figured that if I died, I died. But if I lived, I would practice invocation as a last ditch effort to save my life. So I summoned the demon Belphegor, asking him to show me the best drug- like experience that humans had not yet experienced.  
 

I woke up two mornings later from a nightmare in which I ate my mother’s brain, had an intensely euphoric high, and then, well, she became the poop emoji except without the eyes, wailing in despair. It was extremely troubling for me, and haunted me for years. A couple days after that happened; the poop emoji was released to the public. As things went on I started feeling more panicked and I wasn’t sure why, so I brought myself to the psych-unit.  
 

Over winter break, I started having hyper-realistic flashbacks to absolutely terrifying and disturbing events, in which I was basically a monster. For the longest time I believed I had committed murder. But according to all my friends, family, teachers, police, and doctors that I talked to in that time none of the stuff I remembered happening actually happened. So I began to realize, these things didn’t happen in this branch of reality. They happened in another branch happening simultaneously to this one. Somehow I retained the memories from this other version of reality.  
 

These things got me diagnosed with schizophrenia. Every few months, I would see something in the media clearly relating to a vision I’d had, and more of the vision would be built in my mind faster than real time. It took about 4 years for the majority of the story to build itself in my head, but long story short one night I realized I had practiced tulpamancy, and had succeeded in building a perpetual realm in which I had an avatar that had his own free will, inhabited by dream characters based on people from my life. One night I came to a realization that all of the voices in my head were me, and I started having a waking life conversation with my dream characters, some of them from my childhood. This culminated in me becoming all my voices at once, causing one of the highest psychic experiences I’ve ever had.  
 

Since then I’ve been practicing Wicca. In terms of spiritual understanding I’m at a much better place than I had been my entire life. However I’m failing to take care of myself. I’m about at rock bottom in terms of what I’ve got going for me despite being more content than I’ve been in years. For these and other reason I will be practicing invocation my second time within the next few days.   
 

tl:dr The poop emoji was inspired by my bad experiences with black magic. I wish it would disappear. Wish me luck, give me advice or send energy my way. I’m ready to be a new man, and I think this world needs to mature just as much as I do.",DemonolatryPractices,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X
username#00476,post,2018-11-26,I've started carrying a knife & I'm worried that one day I'll use it,"I'm 24. I live in a small town in Ireland & I was diagnosed with schizophrenia 3 years ago.

A few months back I heard multiple news reports of teenage gangs in my town and nearby towns. Kids were getting jumped, mugged & a few threatened with knives. Two kids were stabbed but their wounds were non fatal.

I'm paranoid because of the schizophrenia. I constantly worry about people breaking into my house & killing me which leads to obsessively checking all doors are locked. The past week I started carrying a knife with me whenever I leave the house.

If I'm caught with the knife it could be a €1000 fine and up to 12 months in prison. But I don't feel safe without it.

But what I'm more worried about is the thoughts that accompany my behaviour. The knife makes me feel powerful. If someone is walking behind me I put my hand in my pocket and hold the knife. I've had multiple fantasies of threatening people with the knife and them being scared of me. I've started dressing in a more intimidating way. Always have my hood up and half my face concealed.

All of this scares me. Could I be capable of actually hurting someone? I don't want to fuck my life up even more. I would be killed in prison.

I'm being honest when I say the mental health thing obviously goes in my favour but I know it's not a great excuse for carrying a concealed weapon. But it helps me feel like I'm not defenceless if something were to happen.

I've spent 5 months in the psych ward this year (3 separate admissions). I feel like I can't tell my doctor about any of this for the risk that I'll be put back in hospital and I don't want to ruin my family's Christmas. I'm at a loss on what I should do.

I told myself that if I really thought I was going to hurt someone then I'd call the police on myself and suffer the consequences.",confession,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X
username#00477,comment,2022-03-30,,"My first symptom was in age 11. For two or more years i was in total hellish fear to be taken by aliens and i thought they are in our apartment. But nobody was noticing it. Then i was depressed for few years in high school, but without psychotic symptoms. Then i went through some nice years and then it all ended when i gave birth in age of 22. After the birth i was super depressed with all that stress about a kid, being such young mother i didnt know what to do etc. My husband was depressed too and we argued. I got antidepressants in that time and it all went better. I went off antidepressants and it was still ok until i started to work for first time in my life. I was getting depressed again and then my grandma died. Those days the first psychotic symptoms appeared, but i was still able to function. It lasted like a year until i got broken down i dont already know why and voices told me to cut myself, so i did it and got hospitalized. I got diagnosis of psychotic episode. When i left the hospital i got off the meds by my own decision, cause i didnt like the side effects. I got psychotic symptoms for another year or so, some days were better or even normal, some days were worse. I got hospitalized again and i already got the diagnosis of schizophrenia. 

I hope it was not too long, sorry. Tldr - my symptoms were more like slow and unnoticable for others.

username#00483,post,2024-01-09,A Question,"I’m not sure how to go about nofap considering my unique circumstances. I have diagnosed schizophrenia, and my hallucinations is a spider girl demon succubus what ever thing that will force herself on me until I ejaculate. This started in May 2021 when I was a novice monk in a monastery was I was in the church for liturgy when suddenly I saw a spider girl trying to drag me out of the Church then later she told me that she was my new god and told me to renounce Christ. Long story short of how I left the monastery was they had me tested then kicked me out. Anyways since then I have gone through psychotic episodes where she forces me against either my bed or the floor while putting images of her doing sexual things to me till I ejaculate. When this happened I wouldn’t receive communion till I went to confession then eventually the priest told me I wasn’t sinning since I didn’t consent to it but I was still in despair. But last October I found a weird coping mechanism that makes the hallucinations go away. I bought a plushie of Kumoko and when ever I hold it the hallucinations go away. So I had my priest bless it and I sleep with it every night. But occasionally about once a week when I’m in my bedroom and I don’t have the plushie in my hand the hallucinations will come and pin my to my floor til I cum. There is very little warning when this happens so I don’t have much time to get the plushie, also I’m petrified with fear when it happens so I don’t know how to react. When I’m not hallucinating I don’t struggle with sexual thoughts and I’m never tempted to fap, so my question is how to I avoid psychotic induced masturbation?

username#00486,comment,2020-10-15,,"I have schizophrenia and a chronic inflammatory disease as well as a slew of life problems growing up. I found the best way to remove some pain and suffering, is to create art or any kind of craft to work out the pain. It may not seem like it can or will help as much as it seems to, but if you can kind of extrovert the suffering and see how you feel in front of your eyes, you may see that the pain is part of a process of life experience. Many other people in the world are in pain and suffer too, so know as well that you are not alone and that it can help build an empathetic and even generous impulse if handled right.

I gave it my all in my art and seeing what was inside of me my whole life and have been seemingly carrying around forever, it actually improved many aspects. Even if it doesn’t immediate relieve anything, at least it can distract and detract from all the negativity of you can find meaning or joy in it somehow.

Thinking of and mediating on the Ancient Greek god Atlas, who was condemned by Zeus to hold up the heavens was known for his endurance of the weight he had to bear. But really though, it’s all still a daily struggle for me, but if it’s chronic, you may benefit if you can find a purpose or use for it, as long it’s channeled either positively, productively, constructively, creatively or healthily. Also knowing there is an observer within you free from any and all of the pain and suffering, you may see if that if it is beyond your control, it can be pushed through, yet it’s still really hard at times.

Also, any feeling or emotion you may feel can seem extreme at times, but sometimes you have to just feel the pain out.

Then came middle school with all the mental health issues. I failed my first class in 6th grade. 7th-10th grade brought ten short term psych hospital stays and plummeting grades.

username#00499,post,2023-06-05,Diagnosed with Schizophrenia - introducing myself :),"Hi everyone,

Feel like reaching out on here is a positive move with all going on, so hello!

I've just recently been diagnosed with Schizophrenia after hearing voices, seeing things and having episodes where I'm in my own little dream land throughout my life (I'm 30 now). I've had a particularly hard year just gone with the loss of my dog and some other uncovered trauma, so currently my voices have a lot of negative fuel and I realised I needed help before I did something bad. So I did!

I'm aware of the super powers of it all though - my voices have encouraged me to do great things and make me feel invincible sometimes, and my episodes can just be goofy silly times which make me laugh. Excited to settle into things.

I have no family and I'm struggling at the moment feeling alientated from my friends, hearing their opinions and conversations about me around my flat and I'm not quite educated enough to talk to them properly about everything.

I just wanted to come say hello, to maybe feel less alone. The most exciting part of it all for me is unlocking access to groups, and I'm looking forward to being around like minded people - like yourselves!

Feel free to say hello! I'd like nothing more right now.

Sending good vibes x",schizophrenia,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X

Despite me being on the same medication for around 3 years now, i've noticed some very destructive personality changes that have took control for the past month or so which is giving clarity in that i'm not getting better. My current medication stated above knocks me out for 16 hours of the day, if not more and makes me drowsy and apathetic constantly for a whole week (and keeping in mind these I have to take one on a daily basis).

I have told both my psychiatrist and medical assessor that my meds do this and they wont seem to get the message across on what it's doing to my health; I can't eat because I'm sleeping all the time therefore i'm losing weight and not getting what I need, I can't function and they are reluctant in changing my meds even with me telling them constantly. Within the past month, i've been experiencing a serious amount of a depression: No motive to do anything, pushing all my friends and family away, anxiety from this 'phase' im going through is permanent or will be around for even longer than what it is.

So my question is, if my medication is doing the aforementioned, should I seek a new psychiatrist? Because no matter how much I tell them, I'm not getting anywhere and waking up feeling depressed every day is seriously getting to me on both a personal, physical and mental scale.

you are right about the messed up perception. many people with schizophrenia didn’t think they have schizophrenia until they get diagnosed, which it may have been discovered after a different condition they were seeing a psychiatrist for, or if they were having a psychotic episode and were hospitalised

a lot of people with schizophrenia suffer with something called anosognosia, which means they may feel like they don’t actually have schizophrenia, and that they were misdiagnosed. it is common for people with psychotic disorders to stop taking their medication because they feel like they don’t need it, or that they don’t need it anymore

but, this isn’t the case for everyone. it isn’t impossible for some to recognise their symptoms and consult a psychiatrist about their concerns, and be correct about it. some people with psychosis can be coherent, too

username#00504,post,2016-03-08,Paranoid about doctors,"Hey you people. I was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia, and my diagnosis used to be major depression with psychotic symptoms. Anyway, I'm feeling really paranoid right now, like that my doctor and psychologist lied to me about the diagnosis for some nefarious reasons. Like that I'm not really schizophrenic. Which wouldn't be nice, because, for some reason, the past few days (after getting diagnosed) I've felt more at ease than ever before. Well maybe not ""ever"", but for the longest time I was constantly agitated and restless. Now I had found peace, but I shattered it myself with my paranoia.

I'm not sure how to cope with this. I feel stupid, and would feel even more so if I contacted my psychologist or doctor regarding these thoughts.

username#00505,post,2024-04-25,"Girlfriend broke up with me because of my delusions. Now we’re getting back together, but her mother hates everything about me because of my delusions and psychosis. What do I do? Please help?","So while my girlfriend and I were living together I experienced severe delusions (I was diagnosed with schizophrenia a very long time ago and have been very open about it to her and her family). I believed I had a career that I didn’t, finances that I didn’t, an education that I didn’t, and success that I didn’t. When it all came out, my girlfriend and her mother assumed it was pathological lying as opposed to delusions… but after increasing my dosages of olanzapine, abilify and rexulti the delusions went away and I’m feeling much better now. I stayed in touch with my then-ex, but after a long period of time we’ve been spending more time together and are in the getting back together stage.

My issue is that her mother, who my girlfriend (not quite but somewhere along those lines, but I’ll just refer to her as gf for simplicity) lives with now hates me and wants nothing to do with me - and wants her daughter to have nothing to do with me. This is extremely hurtful because I used to have an immensely close relationship with her as my mother figure, a far faaaar closer relationship than I have with my own parents. This is hard because she gives my gf shit for coming over to my place, spending time with me, and being with me. I’m also upset that she has been telling people in her circle (ie. family and close friends) that I have schizophrenia, which is an immensely private thing for me - although I guess it’s better than her telling them all that I’m a pathological liar like before……but that is a whole different issue that I won’t get into.

I’m really just looking for any advice on how I can handle this all - what do I do in this situation??

username#00506,post,2021-07-01,My home is no longer safe.,"I don't mean I'm in physical danger or anything. But basically my ""safe space"" is no longer such. I got into a big fight with my mom last night. Basically what happened is: my parents are divorced and my dad and I haven't talked in a really long time. I live with my mom. Recently I started to reconnect with my dad. My mom hates my dad, so now she's mad at me for reconnecting with my dad. She SAYS that she's mad at me because I forgot to clean the living room. But she keeps bringing up my dad and his upcoming wedding CONSTANTLY and throwing it in my face about how ""he hurt me so he's going to hurt you too. Just wait and watch."" I don't even ever bring up my dad. Literally every single day of the week we are fine but on days that I go over to his house she gets so angry with me and finds literally any reason she can to be mad at me and yell at me for something. And then she brings my dad up unprompted. I never argue back with her because I don't make very much money so I rely on her for a lot of things like help with (our) rent and stuff. Last night I argued back with her. Big mistake.

Here's where I get into why my home is no longer safe. I THOUGHT my home was a safe place to be. I thought I could let my guard down and be myself because she always tells me that I'm not a burden, and that she will never kick me out, and that she loves me. So I let my guard down. I got comfortable. I forgot to clean the living room for two weeks (it wasn't even messy enough to clean. It just needed vaccummed). Then, she KNEW it needed cleaning, and instead of asking me to clean it like we had discussed and agreed upon (when we had assigned chores for the apartment we had agreed that if one of our chores needed done we would just ask the other person politely to do it) she waited for me to leave to go to my dad's, then cleaned it herself, then yelled at me for it when I got home. I tried to explain to her that, because of the schizophrenia, sometimes I forget things. And she yelled at me for that too. ""Why don't you just set a reminder in your phone! Honestly is is that hard! I'm asking you to do ONE THING. QUIT THE PITY PARTY!"" At this point I'm trying to hold back tears and a panic attack as I argue back with her, because yes, it is harder than just setting a reminder in my phone!! I have to deal with medication side effects, voices, other life responsibilities (that she has to deal with as well don't get me wrong), college, and not to mention that my brain barely functions as it is! I can barely think most of the time. Half the sentences I say I can't even finish because my brain just up and quits midway through and so I don't have the words. Which also makes it SUPER fun to try and have a discussion with someone who is angry with me because when I'm stressed it's worse so I'm trying to explain why things are falling through the cracks and I can't even get a full sentence out.

At some point in the argument she said (more like yelled) she was extremely disappointed in me. I said that EVERYONE IS. Like she doesn't think all my friends are disappointed that I don't talk to them anymore? She doesn't think all my highschool teachers that wanted me to succeed are disappointed that I am about to fail college? You don't think my dad is disappointed that I'm not some perfect golden boy anymore? You don't think my brothers are disappointed that I'm not a role model for them? Or my professors are disappointed in me every time I miss class without explaining, or turn in something late/miss a deadline, etc. Or even ME being disappointed in MYSELF? Literally my whole life is one big disappointment. She said she doesn't think any of those people are disappointed in me. She said if I were to just explain to those people what was really going on with me they would understand. If I told my professors I was schizophrenic they would go easier on me. If I told my friends I was schizophrenic and I isolate they would accept that and let me back into their lives. And on and on. And EVEN IF THAT WERE TRUE (which it's not), she is disproving it in the VERY conversation we were having that very moment! I was trying to explain to her why I forgot to clean the living room (because the schizophrenia doesn't allow my brain to function properly, i.e remember properly) and she wasn't understanding like she was saying everyone else would! So if she, the person that says loves me more than anyone else in the world, can't accept the fucking mental illness, then no one can.

Then right after that I brought up that I can't ""just tell people"" that I have schizophrenia because of the stigma. She said she doesn't even believe the stigma is real!!! She said I'm just being paranoid. Are you kidding me. I've seen posts on here from people whose friends tell them they can't be friends anymore after 8+ years just because they are schizophrenic. I've seen posts here where people get kicked out of SUPPORT GROUPS because their schizophrenia is ""too much to handle"". Don't even try to tell me the stigma isn't real. Some people out there, even other mentally ill people, view us in a negative light. I have to be very careful about who I tell.

Where this leads to is now, this place that I FOOLISHLY let my guard down in, is now no longer safe. Because if she can get THAT mad because I didn't clean the living room, then she can get way more mad over more serious things. I told her that I would try to never forget to clean the living room again, I would set a reminder in my phone, but if I forgot I asked her to please just remind me instead of yelling at me. Then she said it isn't her responsibility to remind me of my work. Sure, that's fine it's my job. But then why does she insist on doing it herself (especially if it's MY work) just to yell at me because she felt like she had to do it? She told me that the reason I didn't clean the living room is because, ""I (me) think it's okay to treat me (her) like shit"" which is not the case at all. The reason I didn't clean the living room was because I have other stuff going on in my life and I got too comfortable here. Obviously I am supposed to act like a guest here and treat this place as delicately as possible. That is not sarcasm (as I typed it, it sounded a little sarcastic). From now on I have to try 100% literally everywhere I go, which is what I did everywhere else BUT here, because this was my safe space where I could let down my guard. But this place isn't safe. If I let down my guard here, and she gets mad, she is going to throw me out. 100%. I have been kicked out of one house before because of my schizophrenia being too much to handle for them, and it was the worst feeling in the world. I don't know if I will survive it again. It was the EXACT same situation as here too. I was with people who called themselves my family, and they said they would never throw me out. They said they loved me. They said they would help me no matter what. But when I wasn't making progress quick enough for them (I was making progress, but according to them ""two steps forward one step back is still technically backwards""). So they kicked me out. My mom was the ONLY person who would take me in. If I get kicked out of here I will have no where to go. So what do I do from here?

The answer is simple. I have to be perfect. I will never let my guard down again until I live alone. If I slip up even once it will make her angry, and who knows how many times it will take before her ""love"" runs out. So I can't slip up. I need to get a job ASAP. Start saving as much money as possible. Get the hell out of here. No roommate. No one that can EVER possibly hold power over my living situation. Truly independent. On my own. No one is reliable. I learned that lesson last night. From here on out, the only person I can trust is myself. 

This is very long so I don't even expect anyone to read it. If anyone does though, can they just affirm that I'm not crazy? Like I'm not being stupid right? I might be overreacting but the stability of my home feels threatened now and I want to get out of here as fast as possible. I still love my mom, and I won't cut contact with her unless she gives me a real reason to, but last night she showed me that there is no such thing as unconditional love for her and I need to be prepared for when hers runs out.",schizophrenia,i have\s*(schizophrenia); i have\s*(schizo),X

A lot of autistic people are into LGBT and more tend to be into some more uhhh “creative” religions. I think there are spiritual advantages and disadvantages to being autistic.

Disadvantages: I can see a lot of us being hurt by the church. I was alienated by my peers at church because of autism. I was also gender dysphoric from a young age (I grew out of it thankfully), and my first feelings were for girls so I was SSA for a while as well. I have schizophrenia (comorbidity) and both that, meltdowns, and self-harm can be quite a spiritual hurdle. 

Advantages: Apologetics was a special interest for me. It turned out to be a way to bond with other autistic Christians with the same interest. Since I’ve been alienated as a default, I’m not a “friend of the world,” and I can preach the gospel without fear. 

In my weakness He is strong! Being an autistic Christian actually has no disadvantages because God has a way of turning the disadvantages into advantages.",Reformed,i have\s*(schizophrenia); i have\s*(schizo),X

Sometimes I'm not so myself that I can't remember the things I did at that moment, for example if I put a glass somewhere else, when I regain consciousness I can't remember what I did. What worries me the most is that I will unintentionally do something wrong while I am unconscious.

I posted here looking for some help, I just want everything to be okay again, but I see no hope. I want hope, that's all I want now. I know I can't be cured, I know I can't be, happy, sad, sane or not jealous, but that's all impossible with this illness, it's just emptiness, all the time. 

If I was sad then at least I know I can feel, it wouldn't be as lonely if I could feel. This is such a lonely, miserable illness. A lot of people said my diagnosis may be wrong and, well, I think it is, they say it's most likely Schizoaffective Depressive more than just normal Schiz.

Who knows? They're all serious mental health illness that I don't want.

username#00526,post,2022-07-18,If you were volunteering & would be working with teens/young adults - would it be necessary to disclose your diagnosis?,"Hi everyone.

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2018 but I've been dealing with psychosis throughout my life. Apart from my first episode I've always had great insight & after a lot of input from psychology I am both medication & symptom free for the last 9 months.

I have wanted to volunteer for a long time now since I've been out of work for the last 4 years. I would love to volunteer with my local scout troop where I'd be working with teens & young adults from the age of 12-25.

The only worry I have is being asked if I have any mental health diagnoses. Most people will hear the word schizophrenia and assume a lot of things about you which may not be true. 

At the same time I do not like not being honest either but I fear that disclosing my diagnosis will mean I won't be given the opportunity to show them how passionate I am about this.

What are your thoughts? 

I really want to get my life back on track but I'm afraid that my diagnosis will prevent me from being given a chance to move forward.",schizophrenia,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X

username#00530,post,2020-11-21,Is life worth living without suffering?,"Diagnosed Schizophrenic, probably more accurate to say we are Schizoaffective Depressive type, with severe negative, cognitive and mood symptoms, but infrequent positive symptoms enough so that antipsychotics are not needed, sometimes they are still forced anyway but it has only ever made the situation worse for our case.  


Our life consists of rotting in a room being depressed and unmotivated, it has been like this for years, we don't even really scroll through reddit or do any procrastination most would, as there is a profound disinterest, we log in here and check some stuff every few months, we don't play games or watch series, we listen to ambient drone music and simply ruminate forever disinterested in anything else.  


We don't take pleasure in doing anything which is why we don't do things, additionally, even when a faint interest is present our cognitive deficits make it much more difficult than it should be, which impedes tasks from being done and enjoyed, additionally we are severely depressed which makes things a lot harder too, this has been as such for many, many years, and we had many years of therapy, nothing ever helped.  


Until it did, a few weeks ago we found the first antidepressant that ever took away our pain, it didn't just help with it, it did away with it, we weren't hurting anymore (an MAOI for those curious).  


Despite that, there is no change in our functioning, we still have no interest in doing anything and for what we tried we still don't feel pleasure, we feel nothing, whereas before at least we felt pain.   


We don't like this, it only makes this all seem more pointless, and besides it has always felt as if we were made to suffer, this is our only purpose, so we decided to stop taking this medication as we feel alienated and wrong being allowed to just feel better like that for no reason, it is a difficult predicament, and it is tough to imagine if anyone could understand, but is life worth living without pain? what is the point in it, it feels like having no identity, getting rid of pain doesn't give us any positive content, it just subtracts from the experience. We've always wanted this to go away but now that it did it seems too late, maybe they were right after all.. it feels as if despite feeling better there is a constant emotional phantom pain pervading everything we do, everything we think, and if anything, it is the fact that it isn't there that makes it all the more disturbing, its a part of us.. maybe its all we have, don't want to give it up.",schizophrenia,diagnosed\s*(schizophrenic); diagnosed\s*(schizo),X

Now I am 41yrs and I have quit weed about 4mths now since being diagnosed with schizophrenia. About 10mths ago I started to hear voices which were like very light whispers at the time.......and ofcourse this just sent me into a state of shock. The voices kept me up for about a week or more. I was very delusional for about 3yrs before hearing the voices. My delusions were that i would be watching tv or listening to music and somehow thought the messages were intended for me ,I thought my friends and workmates were against me as well. About 3mths b4 my psychosis became hyper vigilant and hyper aware.....I began to think my family had turned on me because they would bring stuff for me to eat and for some reason I got sick when I ate the food....so I now believed I was being poisoned by my own family......The food when eaten gave me the worst headaches I have ever felt in my life.
Anyway I went to see a specialist in April of last year and he put me on haloperidol5mg for about 6mths and then put me on risperdal2mg for the last 3mths of which I am still taking.
I have no more delusions and hallucinations ever since. The delusions have only left about 3mths as I was taken off the haldol.

Physical sexual and verbal, plus a good bit of gaslighting. I ran away from home at a young age 12-14. Me not knowing any better and coming from Sukhothai in the north ran south figuring I'd get as far out of the way as possible. Well just my luck I'm settled in and about 22 the south Thailand insurgency starts so I was caught at soldier age in the middle of a war zone. I stayed a civvy due to my mental condition but that didn't stop me from being used to lift stretchers, and be in areas that were under severe contest, I won't say more about it for now. . All in all I developed PTSD on top of schizophrenia, which isn't easy to cope with let alone find those that can help. I ended up years later. 2019 going back home, to find my parents had both passed in my absence and I took a job as a Tuk Tuk driver for tourists for the pure simple fact that I had minimal education, lived as a street kid etc. As of now I am studying under a village shaman and a practicing Buddhist.

username#00540,post,2021-12-29,Medication,"This will probably get deleted because of how pro medication this subreddit seems to be but so far I’m one month free of risperidone. (I was on risperidone for 1 year)

I was originally put on 4mg of risperidone then over the course of about 5 months I weened myself down to .5mg a day. Right after thanksgiving I stopped taking the meds.

The first thing that happened was I needed to sleep less, instead of 12 hours now I am sleeping about 8 hours. Dizziness lasted for about a week after stopping the meds. I stopped vaping, for some reason I don’t have the urge to vape anymore which is weird because I’ve smoked/vaped my whole life. The best thing that has happened is I enjoy video games again, when I was younger video games were super fun.

However, ever since I had my first episode I have been really bad at making new friends and holding conversations, I manage to get by but I’m definitely not a talker.

I just wanted to let people know that maybe it is possible to live without medication. Maybe it isn’t and I will go into psychosis soon. I do know that so far being med free has made me immensely happy.

I am 24 and was diagnosed schizophrenic a month before turning 23. I was homeless for 6 months before  I was caught by police and taken to the hospital. I do fear that will happen again but I just can’t stand the flat emotion and zombie like nature of medication.

I always thought my psychosis was brought on by weed because I smoked before I started wondering the streets and had a very bad trip (super loud voices like 100s of them at the same time) However being off meds for a month I sometimes hear people saying things in my head but I know they’re not real.",schizophrenia,diagnosed\s*(schizophrenic); diagnosed\s*(schizo),X
username#00541,post,2022-06-16,Got diagnosed,"Hello, my name's Martyna and I am 17 years old. Soon to be 18.

I wanted to share my story because I am not comfortable with people in my surroundings to learn it just yet.

I was recently (3 days ago) officially diagnosed with Schizophrenia which took a long one-year process of finding a genuine psychiatrist that looked into my case and received starting medication (Haloperidol-Richer 1.5mg).

I struggled with severe depression and anxiety which led to suicidal thoughts. My family isn't educated on this topic and therefore cannot support me emotionally, which leaves most of the understanding of what the fuk is up with me on my own. I first drew conclusions about Bipolar...yet I started visiting the school's psychologist which did a psychodiagnostic and we found out that it's something from the schizo spectrum and from there it was a kick towards a more concrete direction. Even though I was already diagnosed with adaptation disorder (F 43.2) in the past.

It took me over 2 years of suffering from depression to actually confess that I am struggling and receive help. I went to consultations with the psychologist and art therapy for 6 months and it helped me very very much and shined even a clearer path on what might be the issue. 

Around 4 months ago I transferred to the active stage of schizophrenia that arose hallucinations, many many very twisted delusions, and growing paranoia towards the world, people, and even myself. I never had many friends in my life, they either pushed me away or the contact just disappeared. So, social isolation wasn't very surprising but I noticed that it has gotten severe, where I wouldn't even go outside to breathe some air or pet my doggies. 

That's where I got more attention because my grades have been dropping drastically because of trouble with focus/attention and memory. I have an issue that I am able to learn the theory and what the book and teacher intend to say, but I can't apply it when I get a test. I get really anxious and sometimes experience anxiety attacks. I am a student in the IBDP program which is seriously difficult but I just feel the responsibility to be here. I also have built my bonds and I learned so much together with amazing teachers that helped me along the way, therefore if I were to spend my last year in some public school unhappy and graduate with no smile and people with who I suffered together with, I would probably be as good as just dead...

My mother is very worried that as she pays a lot for my education if I will fail then I would be a waste. The same way she thinks about my driving because it is taking me a long time to develop the skill of handling a manual. But again, I don't want to give it up just yet, even if yesterday I had a very bad panic attack due to feeling emotionally abandoned by family. The only person in the family with that I am honest about my condition is my older sister. She lives with her partner and occasionally visits which for me is the biggest joy. But I feel very comfortable with her and her way of living. 

I am quite tired of everything and suicidal thought has been popping up more and more recently which isn't comforting whatsoever...

I don't know what else to add, I feel tired and lost my focus. So, this is for now what is sitting on the top of my head and what I wanted to get off my heart. I hope you weren't bored with this vent and maybe find the time to tell me what you thought of it. Do I sound stupid or is it a genuine shitty experience at a young age? 

Thank you so much for reading (if you did) and I guess I'll be hanging out around here, looking for some company :))",schizophrenia,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X

i hate being thought of as someone to fear. i never want to hurt anybody, and it just really sucked to see how scared of me he was.

i no longer talk to him, and have asked him not to contact me because it felt really awful trying to salvage a friendship with someone who is so afraid of me that he can't even be alone in a room with me. i'm trying to be positive and focus on the fact that i have other people in my life who are supportive, but i'm just really sad about the whole thing.",schizophrenia,i have\s*(schizophrenia); i have\s*(schizo),X

Cannot keep a job for long. Every day is spent living in extreme fear and paranoia. Can't go in public without using earbuds as a distraction from all the outside noise and eye contact with strangers freaks me out because I'm convinced that they can see inside my head and read my thoughts.

username#00549,comment,2022-01-13,,"This has been my journey for years. I've had these weird changes in perception, tics, & jerks for years. I even have hallucinations that look like color swirls & hear music & chiming occasionally. When I was a teenager, the family doctor said it was stress. Later it was anxiety. And then my last doctor diagnosed with schizophrenia & put me on antipsychotics that absolutely wrecked me. I felt like a husk of a person & gained 60 lbs. I had hypertension & high cholesterol for the first time in my life. I lost interest in everything. I couldn't work. All I could do was sleep. I ended up joining some support groups & once I started talking to other people with schizophrenia, I realized that what I was experiencing seemed a lot different. The only thing I could relate to were the experiences with medication side effects. That's when I became convinced it was something else & started obsessively Googling every symptom I had.

I ended up quitting my meds & pressing my doctor to run more tests. When she found out I stopped the antipsychotics, she threatened to send me to a psychiatric hospital & I had to be released into my husband's care. It was traumatic & embarrassing. I ended up going to urgent care to tell them I thought I was having seizures & my doctor wouldn't listen to me. I begged them to refer me to a specialist or a different doctor. They set me up with a new GP who ended up being awesome. She ordered a bunch of tests & discovered I have some form of hypopituitarism, a chiari malformation, & signs of an autoimmune disorder. I found out that my constant sinus headaches & congestion were actually migraines. And she had me start a journal to keep track of the weird sensations. I was able to identify triggers that convinced her it was epilepsy & I FINALLY got referred to a neurologist. I can't get in for further testing until March, but my GP suggested some vitamins & supplements to try while I'm waiting to hopefully reduce some of the discomfort. Now that I know the symptoms, I can even tell what lobe of my brain it's starting in. It's weird but also kind of interesting. I'm worried about brain damage, but at this point it's been happening for 20 years.

username#00558,post,2020-04-16,Schizophrenia but immune to stimulant psychosis?,"When I was 16, I was put on risperidone.. Voices, agitation, bizarre thoughts, etc..

At 17 I was put on Concerta for hypersomnia and ADHD.

I'm 23 and have been taking antipsychotics and stimulants for 8 years. I used to abuse stimulants because my hypersomnia was so bad but eventually took Vyvanse as prescribed for 2-3 years once every morning.

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 18 but I've never had stimulant psychosis which makes me think I have autism (Which often comes with ADHD, OCD, depression, a form of psychosis, etc).

I've done psychedelics and they definitely made me psychotic and gave me dissociative panic attacks from derealization and depersonalization to this day.. Sometimes.. The high dose psychedelic trips helped a lot with negative symptoms but I don't advise at all for someone with psychosis to do those ever.

Anyways if anyone else with schizophrenia is on a stimulant, let me know =\] Because a lot can't seem to tolerate a stimulant without getting psychosis.",schizophrenia,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X

My old psychologist tried to tell me this a few years ago but I didn't want to entertain that reality. Foolishly, I thought it would just go away on its own. Tried to tell myself that ""a few"" auditory hallucinations and ect. were normal.


When I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder after finally seeking psychiatric help I didn't bring up these issues for several months. I thought the bipolar medications would make it all cease. ""It's just my mood swings causing it all. No need to worry myself further."" Then I noticed that even if I wasn't manic or hypomanic it would still happen.



Ignoring it made it worse. Much worse. Looking back, I'm not sure why I couldn't just accept it. Don't do what I did. Ask for help. The antipsychotics have given me a newfound clarity, somewhat.

If it’s important, I can also add what he’s done to emotionally abuse me/stories which have been called abusive/given me trauma in the comments but at this point I don’t know what to do, he’s also in the past threaten to report me missing/call the police/break into my mum’s house if I left but I don’t know if he’s still going to go through with that.

I don't expect anyone to read this, but thank you if you do :)

I'll try to keep it short.
Hi i'm FriendlyPiplup, and i'm 17.
I'm a little over three months away from my three year anniversary of two things, first being my suicide attempt and the second being time since i last self harmed.
Since i tried to end my life they sent me to a psych ward and honestly i hated every second there. But I got diagnosed with psychosis and they gave me new medication too(Aripiprazole 15mg). This new medication worked wonders and back in february i got diagnosed with Schizophrenia.

EVERYTHING WAS FINE for over 2 years and then august 2023 started...
I saw the person who abused me as a kid, twice in a week...
And then i started having bad thoughts.
At the beginning of september because of the bad thoughts i harmed myself for the first time in almost three years.
And now i can't look at a knife without thinking about ending my life.

But to be honest, the part that made everything worse was the part where i realized i probably wouldn't make another true friend again, trust me i've tried for four years... and that i would never get a girlfriend, i've never even had a real girlfriend... i really just want to be a normal teen, who falls in love with girls and makes friends and stuff like that, but no, i guess not. I know all of this sound stupid... but the friend part is important to me.

I don't know what i'm hoping to get out of this, i think this is a cry for help... almost like i know how all of this is going to end, and i'm just trying to not let it end that way, i did something similar 3 years ago before my attempt.
I'm sorry.

username#00583,post,2021-08-29,Hey everyone!,"Hi everybody! Just thought it would be nice to introduce myself.

I'm in my 40s, and diagnosed schizophrenia since more than 20 years, I am retired since the first major outbreak. So the disease bombed me out of life right in/after my teens.

I'm one of those where the medication only helps a little, so I've got a long history of trying to learn to cope with the problem. After thinking about it a lot, I am pretty sure that I had delusive symptoms already when I was a little child, then in my teens the prodromal phase made me heavily drown into the dullness. At some point I started heavily getting the mindfunk, like basically nonstop voices, images, illusions, paranoid and delusion in my head in a merry go round 24/7. Sometimes I also experience hallucinations outside of my head or altered perceptions, but luckily that is rare for me to encounter.

It almost destroyed me in the beginning, but I didn't give up, made it my challenge, and now I am really glad to be alive and not having given up early on. I did a lot of work on myself and my life and mindsets, and it was totally worth it. So much, that I now believe even when I suffer a lot, a ""normal"" life would not have made me happy, but the psychotic life did! It made me learn to love, it made me appreciate the truly important values in life. People, with the disease you are not damned to never recover. Life can be great even when the hallucinations don't go away. Even it can be used to benefit and grow upon, when you survive all the mess and not get lost in it, then it can make you very wise, crazywise.

Then, my disease only got worse up to the point where I had to be hospitalized involuntary. Then, I was given no choice but to receive injections (even though I agreed to take medication orally).

I have pretty severe delusions (my most prominent symptom) including long episodes where I believed I was the antichrist, believing I was possessed, the reincarnation of an alien who could communicate with my former self, believing song and TV shows have hidden messages etc. 

I also have problems with my ""train of thought"", the way I describe this is that if my mind were a piece of paper, imagine someone tore it up and scattered it to the wind and im trying to connect it all in my head to have a working mind. It's jumbled and messy and it can be difficult to function.

I also have what I suppose could be described as ""negative symptoms"": lethargy/lack of motivation/apathy, depression, I isolate myself like a hermit and can't have stable relationships at all, very few friends etc, though it's hard to tell how much of this stems from my other symptoms, you know?

Those are the big things for me, I guess, but if you have any questions about my symptoms, just ask. 

When I first went to see my psych his intuition was Delusional Disorder and he wrote it down and explained it to me and everything (but didn't make a formal diagnosis) and then later as I got a bit worse and idk, he must have seen other symptoms or something, he chose to diagnose me with Schizophrenia.

For others, medication is a life saver. It’s a whole spectrum ranging from life saving to life crippling, so you’re definitely right that there’s no magical cure.

I personally both consume CBD oil and vape CBD daily. I can't really feel anything but it seems like it has helped with mood and anxiety. I have not noticed any effect on psychotic symptoms.

My doctor is not explicitly able to recommend it but she suggests that it may help and has noticed a positive difference in me since I started taking it. I should add that I am also diagnosed with schizophrenia and OCD along with dpression.

Ive been a fan of attack on titan for years, i recently got back into it after waiting for it to be finished,im on my second watch thru this year, and i read the entire manga this year too.

My wife cant help but tell me its weird i like this show because of the obvious facisist stuff. She says its weird i want a tattoo of something from the series(i have a blanknspot on my right bicep i wanna put the wings of freedom on) she says itll go great with the facisist symbol i already have (i have a huge imperial aquila feom warhammer 40k between my shoulders) 

Ffs its a fictional world just because i find the imperium interesting from an rpg standpoint indont actually support those ideals ourside the game. Same goes for attack on titan, i can like stuff and understand that its FICTION. But then she doubles down and gets on my case saying it's weird to even like it as fiction and i must have some deep facisist leanings burried deep im not aware of.

I get so upset that i cant enjoy certain media without her calling me a facisist sympathizer. Even though im fucking not i can like full metal alchemist and attack on titan and nor be a damn nazi or whatever. 

She sees facsisim everywhere though, she is convinced its only a matter of time before the facisists get control of the country(we live in the us) and start killing people in the streets who don't agree with their views.

I cant reason with her *shrugs* boy have i tried but she turns it on me saying i wouldnt be getting mad at her statements if i wasnt a little bir facisist otherwise why get mad? (I dunno maybe being called fascist all the time is frustrating me to no end)

Im a Trans man , married to a trans women. We are both jewish, shes an anarchist, im still learning about politics it wasnt something i paid attention to when i was younger only in theblast few years did i start paying attention and deciding where my own beliefs and shit were.

Im so frustrated and dunno how to handle it. Im at the point where i just dont talk about certain Media with her because it gets to heated.

I hate this and then she wonders why i spend alot of tome on reddita because she wont let me talk about things i enjoy. :(

Im 34, almost 35, shes 35. We are grown adults, i have schizophrenia and even im not that fucking bad about the government being facisist (off my meds incan get a bit weird about the government) but i dont know what her problem is, yes facisists are bad but come on.",rant,i have\s*(schizophrenia); i have\s*(schizo),X

username#00607,post,2023-10-10,Diagnosed this year,"Hi redditors.

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia on summer this year. The diagnosis itself actually was comforting. We knew something off is going on in our head but for years (10 years at least) could not find an appropriate psychiatrist who would look deeper into the experiences we were going through. Also sometimes it seemed that everything is alright even if it wasn't.

That said the diagnosis happened too late for our liking. Something wrong was happening for many years before it, caused me to do harm to others, which led to losing friends and romantic partners. Now, after the electroconvulsive therapy and on antipsychotic meds there are much less voices. Delusional thinking is also somewhat decreased, but not totally gone. Now I am just being alone all the time at home, with couple of friends visiting from time to time. No hobbies, no outside activities. Social contact or just being in places with people who might look at me seems scary and turns on the delusional brain, leads to increased heartbeat, depersonalization/derealization.

News about war also have a huge impact on wellbeing. Humanity seems to be on the brink of extinction. Any of us could die any day. Seems like nothing is worth doing in the world where people are in a constant conflict. Sometimes delusional brain says I can do something about it and just guilt trips us. These are probably the worst days to live through.

Really would like to have some connection with people who are going through the similar motions in their life. Would gladly chat about meaninglessness of our existence and ways to keep the brain healthy.",schizophrenia,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X
username#00608,post,2019-03-26,Sleeping problems and hallucinations on medication,"Hi guys,


I'm 23, male and I've been diagnosed with Schizophrenia about 5 months ago. I have a history (starting 2014) of psychotic episodes.
Currently I'm taking 600 mg Seroquel XR.
I work as a software developer in a small start up.
I'm working 20-30% at the moment but would like to work 100% (full time). However I'm unable to do so. It's because I can't concentrate for more than 4 hours and my sleep is irregular too. (Sometimes I sleep for 8 hours and sometimes for over 15 hours. X( )
I'm wondering if this is ”normal“ when having schizophrenia or not. My therapist said I shouldn't experience hallucinations on medication. What I recently discovered is when I'm not working (vacation) I practically have no hallucinations. My sleep is still irregular though. 

I'm wondering if some of you can relate and maybe guide me to the next steps I should take. (New job, another medication etc..)

username#00609,comment,2024-02-25,,"Hey there my friend and thanks for posting this. Mental health/illness is a topic that we should be discussing more but is sadly swept under the rug. I am diagnosed schizophrenic, so I understand where you are coming from. If you need someone to talk to who is also not neurotypical, you can message me. 

Sometimes it’s very hard for me to be around neurotypical ppl too. Not that I’m scared of them, it’s because I honestly don’t have the patience or capacity to deal with them a lot of the time. On the other hand, I got very lucky bc my local community has been very accepting and supportive of my situation (I’ve been honest with them about it for a long time). I guess it helps that many of them work in the medical field. When I miss feasts, gatherings etc, they understand why and don’t pressure me or interrogate me when I DO come back. A few of my close friends will reach out just to make sure I’m ok, but that’s about it. 

My advice.. since autism is a spectrum disorder like schizophrenia, you’re not gonna have the same issues or severity as others. Do your research and figure out what ur problem areas are and work on them. Meditation, prayer, therapy all help. Be honest with your community if you feel comfortable doing that. And as someone else commented, the writings are HIGHLY beneficial and therapeutic. The Holy Scripture are words of the Divine so they contain magical (I don’t wanna use that word but idk what else to call it) properties. They are meant to heal and guide us. I always feel comforted when I read Baha’u’llah’s words. Been reading Book of Certitude lately and it’s helped me a lot. It’s the most visceral of Bahá’u’lláh’s work I think. And it’s comforting to know that even He had His moments of feeling lost, desperate, confused..",bahai,diagnosed\s*(schizophrenic); diagnosed\s*(schizo),X

username#00612,post,2022-02-22,I’ll need therapy my whole life and it scares me,"Hello!
I’m sorry if I misspell some words, English is not my first language (I’m French :))
I just wanted to share some things about my life with people that may understand me 

I’ve been diagnosed with schizophrenia like 2 months ago, I’m 17. I think my illness is pretty light, because I don’t have that much hallucinations, even tho the negative symptoms are so strong that everybody thought I had depression, but that’s not the point. 

My therapist said that I’ll need therapy all my life and it was quite a shock. I always thought I had depression and it will go away with the years, but turns out I have a mental illness that stays forever. I’m so afraid, I don’t want to struggle my whole life. Life is so hard at this moment, it’s been worse and worse since I’m 13 (I also have anxiety disorder and I’m gifted (i’m not sure if it’s the right word, I mean I have a high iq)). I don’t see myself struggling that way my whole life, I don’t want to. I’m already so sad that I can’t fully enjoy my teenager years.

In the other hand, I feel like a fraud. I’m not even a heavy case, I shouldn’t complain. To tell you the truth, I don’t even believe myself that I’m schizophrenic, even tho all the doctors said it’s true.

I know I’m supposed to get better with time but for now it just keeps getting worse and worse. I’m really afraid of my future. I can clearly see my adult self losing her job and friends and not correctly eating / showering.

I'm currently seeing another therapist more so for depression. She's wonderful. Her advice is frankly quite common sense, but I find the therapy helpful as I have someone professional to discuss my recovery efforts with, and I feel I'm more motivated to achieve my goals when I have someone to update my progress to.

username#00615,post,2020-08-25,cured schizophrenia by years of medications? wrongly diagnosed?,"im two days fully off of my anti psychotics after years of self tapering and although i ahvent slept in 2 days i see barely any increase in my positive symptoms minus a lot of negative symptoms, although my medication never really helped my positive symptoms as much as my psych was hoping so my symptoms never really went away.

i read a report on how the receptors responsible for schizophrena in your brain become numb after a few years of antipsychotics making it harder for full on psychotic episodes to arise and it got me wondering if after years on meds i could possibly be cured, however just because its been two days doesnt mean that i wont fall back into a heavy psychotic state which is the scariest part for me but i have a hard time believing it'll happen.

was i wrongly diagnosed with schizophrenia? is this normal, or was i heavily medicated for years for no reason? did my brain morph itself to cure my schizophrnia?

sorry for rant. i'm very confused and feel like the fabric of reality is ripping away because ive based my entire life off of this diagnosis and managing it but it seems i might actually just be fine

username#00616,comment,1695307208.0,,"I moved to new city to start start engineering studies in 2015. I had cognitive problems. Problems with my memory were quite apparent. Past the stage that it wasn't a joke and my friend could also notice it. I struggled with basic math. Earlier in my life I had excelled in math.  
  
I had to put school on hold after the first year. Unfortunately I didn't seek help. I didn't think anyone would take a 20 something year olds memory issues seriously. I couldn't fathom how I would explain the problems I had with math.  
   
Christmas 2015 was the last time I saw any of my family. Not like they would have been of use anyway. My one close friend moved to another city for this studies. So I didn't have anyone close in the same city. 
  
From May 2016 to October 2018 I worked. I fought till the end. When my close friend was visiting me I asked him to book me an appointment to a private psychiatrist. I was very broken to the point of not being able to get help myself.   
  
My symptoms were so clear that the psychiatrist knew it was schizophrenia on the first visit. As schizophrenia can't legally be diagnosed in a single visit the diagnosis was depression. Month later at second visit I was given F21 schizotypal disorder diagnosis. I was told that I have schizophrenia. In the diagnosis text it says I have negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  
  
As I also qualified for schizotypal disorder diagnosis that was chosen. Guess there was reluctance to put the more serious F20 schizophrenia diagnosis based on two visits and no prior history even though I was verbally told it was schizophrenia.  
   
The diagnosis came as a complete surprise. I knew there was a lot wrong with me. I had recognized plethora of symptoms invidually but didn't put them together to get full picture. Even if I had put all the symptoms together I wouldn't have seen the connection to psychosis let alone schizophrenia.  
  
That is the thing with early symptoms of schizophrenia. They aren't anything that comes to mind when one thinks about schizophrenia. If a person with incredible insight landed on a page about prodromal schizophrenia it could be possible to see the connection. But that's pretty unheard of.   
  
So the answer to people who wonder if they have schizophrenia is no. Seek help. You'll be told if the answer is yes.  
  
As of August 2022 I have F20 schizophrenia diagnosis and was put on disability pension.  
  
It is extemely unfortunate that I didn't have anyone close in my life. I should have sought help already in 2015. 2019 onwards I did massive damage to my life. Ruined my finances and hit the rock bottom. Eventually I got evicted. Thank god I had a friend willing to house me. I would have ended myself if my friend and neighbour didn't help me after the eviction.  
   
I am deeply jealous of those who have supporting families. After I moved out at age of 17 I haven't received any support. I used to be very proud of the fact. Surviving and succeeding on my own was part of my personality. Now I see it as sad. Having people around to support is quite important. Not having any isn't something to be proud of.",schizophrenia,i have\s*(schizophrenia); i have\s*(schizo),X
username#00617,post,2021-09-05,I am a real thought broadcaster diagnosed with schizophrenia disorder- reaching out for help& support (feel free to dm),"Hello everyone, (important questions at the end)
I have been thought broadcasting since  early 2019 (2+years) and happen to Not believe that when other people in my environment- be it in the parking lot over the fence downstairs, in the next room or right beside me- comment directly to the thoughts going on in my head sometimes word-for-word is a delusion but rather, a phenomenon. 

I have finally reached a point where I have overcome the phase which it began with (someone speaking out in words unrelated to a conversation they might be having at the time) happening 24/7 -from the time I woke up to the time I fell asleep- feeling like I was being bullied into submission of my own personal thoughts, feeling like my once normal life had been hijacked away from me and dwelling each day in absolute misery leading to depression because I felt oppressed as it was taking over my life.. 
I can now cope with this phenomenon which is indeed happening to not only myself but many many others on this planet but is denied by modern science and when this gift/disability is notified to a professional psychologist we get labeled as a delusional schizophrenic and since it is viewed as such we often don’t get the help we need which would be great but in my experience they don’t even bother putting themselves in my shoes because they’re so focused that my belief is false. 
I am set out to get to the root of the problem within ourselves (including others) that causes us to not be able to manage anymore amongst one another. I am here to say that there’s a serious need for a change in our collective mentality… because on one hand if I was perceiving someone’s thoughts I would not simply open my mouth and say whatever I felt like but would be compassionate and take it very seriously..it would change my whole perspective of reality and I would share my experience with the world as much as possible. Mind blown 🤯 On the other hand I have learned not to allow my outer environment affect my inner environment too much & stop caring what people think and not rely on anything except my own inner power to overcome… ☮️☯️💓

I believe we should come together to spread awareness since there doesn’t seem to be a lot of information about it on the internet & that is my intention of this post… beat me to it ! I dare you! 😋

You can take what I say for what it is.

Since everyone technically experiences thought broadcasting when people react and respond to the things you say in everyday life, you put yourself out there and expect either agreement or backlash... I just happen to have no choice to speak or not, it is being perceived and responded to…I expect nothing and feel startled by the sudden bursts of sound directly relating to what I said. 

Was I descriptive enough? 

What do you/would you do to cope with thought broadcasting experience? Is this your first time hearing about it? What are your thoughts/theories about thought broadcasting? Any thoughts or comments? 

It is all appreciated 🙏 sending you tons of peace & calmness, gcompassion and unconditional love",schizophrenia,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X

But, my doc said that I have schizophrenia and she's just unwilling to give me that diagnosis because it could give problems getting insurance and the fact that I am able to work as an engineer. So for all intents and purposes, I really have schizophrenia. I just didn't update my flair after that conversation.

I'm still struggling with accepting my disease as you noted. I went ten years untreated and undiagnosed out of pure will power. I hid it from everyone and slowly withdrew further and further and slipped further and further into my delusions. I eventually attempted suicide and at that point my then fiance forced me to go to the mental ward of the hospital.

I've spent so long in denial and just hiding everything from everyone that I don't know how to even begin. I'm probably the worst case for highly functional people with our disease because I fought against treatment. My uncle's had the disease and I saw where it lead them and I just didn't want to be like them. But I'm not them and I have to keep telling myself that. I can stay on my meds and stay functional.

But let me tell you this movie is uncomfortably accurate in its portrayal of schizophrenia. The movie itself did not scare me, but the way it portrayed the illness and the interpersonal relationship struggles that go along with it made me almost turn the movie off. It was like reliving so much that has happened in my own life due to my illness. That’s really a good thing, because other movies listed on this thread are terribly inaccurate portrayals. Really this movie is the only accurate portrayal I’ve ever seen and it does an amazing job of it.

If you have experienced any mental illness and are interested in participating in this project, all you have to do is answer a few ANONYMOUS questions. Each submission will be turned into a digital art / graphic design piece, then collected together in a zine/book. Main goals: (1) Let mentally ill people speak about their own experiences, (2) to inform and raise awareness to people who haven't had mental health struggles, and (3) to humanize and bring together everyone involved.

Diagnosed schizophrenic since 2017, on 16 mg Haldol and a number of other non-AP meds for anxiety and depression and the like. A couple weeks ago I went off all my meds cold turkey for about three days and by the time I went back on them because I couldn't take it anymore, my boyfriend told me (I remember none  of this) that I was wandering around talking to people who weren't there, slamming the same door over and over in our friend's apartment, and thought he was a demon and I didn't have a boyfriend. Even medicated I hear voices almost constantly although they get worse throughout the day and have some ""strange beliefs"" like I believe the government controls the weather in league with aliens who are controlling people to do their bidding using the wind.

Fast forward to a few days ago. I've been staying in bed later and later, not because I'm necessarily staying up later (1 am approx the last few nights) but I laid in bed until 3 pm yesterday and 12:30 pm today. I've also been having VERY CRAZY, VERY VIVID, and VERY VIOLENT hallucinations which don't tie in with my dreams at all while lying in bed, like I could swear I'm awake for them but I know they're probably just hypnopompic hallucinations. Yesterday it was sounds of a man screaming and screaming while getting stabbed over and over by another man, today it visions of was a female POW who got r\*ped by not only her captors but they also forced other male POWs to r\*pe her and then they killed the male POWs and left them inside her and their bodies decomposed and her flesh necroticized from having their decomposing flesh inside her. Horrific shit. It makes me scared to lie there in the mornings but I just can't force myself to get up, my body feels like lead and I'm just so exhausted. It's not sleep paralysis either, as I'm not paralyzed when this happens and can move about freely.

&#x200B;

I haven't explained my situation since my introduction a long time ago, and never in-depth, so I'll explain it from the beginning.

I experienced a disembodied voice at first, but in time, what I would refer as a *personality* (rather than a voice) coalesced. I did not understand what it was, but I was not concerned as it was neither hostile nor controlling like stereotypical schizophrenic voices are.

In my search for answers, I found a subreddit called r/Tulpas. Its community told me that I was what's called ""plural"" - someone who has more than one personality in their brain. As I understand, it is not a diagnosed condition itself, but is a neurodivergence that includes, among other non-disorderly things, DID. This sounds quite different from my diagnosed schizophrenia.

I believed them then, and I still do now. No matter what anyone has told me, my stance has not wavered, but I have pondered on the matter more than is healthy in recent months. Schizophrenia as a diagnosis for this friend in my head seems too...*dismissive* of my experiences. I feel something more complex is going on.

username#00651,post,2021-04-30,I just wanted to share my story,"I started having hallucinations when I just turned 5, it was most likely a result of being abused for being transgender at a really young age (people/peers not understanding or being bigoted, either way it hurt the same ways) It started out as voices and got worse from there, I officially had my first serious delusion a year and a half later. My abuse didn't get any better as I was also misunderstood for my developed schizophrenia, and never gotten an official diagnosis, not even now. By the time I saw any kind of therapist, he didn't believe I needed a diagnosis because it ""didn't seem to bother me now"" and although by that time, more than a decade later, my symptoms have died down a lot, I still had hallucinations on the occasion. I've never had the opportunity to bring up anything schizo related because of trouble communicating and even lying to them because it was obvious that they didn't want to hear me anyways so I would see his reaction- that he wasn't a good therapist and how he treated me proved that more, and plus I spent my entire life not complaining after the first year of onset after how I was treated, but it so still made me angry that he completely dismissed that I was being bothered by my schizophrenia all together, and refused to listen to how being misunderstood as a child got me abused and domino effected it's way into developing my self doubt, which lead to the anxiety he was so desperately trying to focus on instead. Spolier alert I spent a year with an asshole, and was misdiagnosed with GAD as I believed it was more of Social Anxiety Disorder because I feared that I could be this bad person to the people around me because I was told that so many times, so it only really flared up around people. I mean, having Anxiety and Depression that flairs up around people because of abuse from people, given that of course I have trouble communicating. Although now I just think of it as anxiety, which can technically mean GAD, I just felt like it was the wrong diagnosis because it was given to me in a day by a family doctor after only listening to my abusive mother, trying to frame me saying I have Schizophrenia on ""Stress from School"" and they never really helped me get down to the actual problem. After surviving Schizophrenia, PTSD, and Severe Anxiety, I am still left with this depression about how no one understands me and I'll never be supported/loved in my life. I'm still trans after all and still not getting unconditional love from my totally not abusive family, and have cut out many ""friends"" out of my life who assumed I was trying to make Schizophrenia my whole personality just by wanting to talk about it properly with someone, among other things. This entire time I try to find answers to things, and before then I make stupid posts, do stupid things, stupid because it's not the answer and honestly don't know what I was trying to get out of them. So now I just want to leave this here, one of my abusive family members stalks this subreddit because I made it clear I was trying to find solace in my years of crazy hallucinations, delusions, and trauma from it, and frequented this sub lots before.

Next step was medication which was a long and honestly not pleasant experience but after getting the right combo he was right, it was all worth it. It did not make everything go away but made my life a Ton better and I was able to continue life on much better footing. The whole process took about four year.

username#00657,post,2022-10-30,"DAE experience extremely intense, specific nostalgia?","I learned recently that frequent deja vu is a sign of actual brain dysfunction. Since I have schizophrenia and experience deja vu pretty frequently, I think this checks out. However, now I am wondering if the same is true for the emotion of nostalgia, if mentally ill people are more likely to experience it. Because I sometimes experience just a flood of intense nostalgia specifically toward when I was in the prodromal phase of developing schizophrenia (early-mid high school). For some reason this is the period I experience the most severe nostalgia. And strangely, due to mental illness, this was probably some of the worst times of my life. Yet I feel so nostalgic that I wish I could go back and relive them all over again the exact same. Sometimes I'll just spend a while looking at my high school transcript or past projects that I still have, even my old reddit account that I posted on a lot, and just zone out thinking about those specific 2 years. There's this strange otherworldly glow to those years, like it happened in another lifetime. My brain was changing so much that each year presented its own spin on insanity. I just don't know how to describe the sudden intensity of this specific nostalgia. I'll think about and feel super nostalgic for things that were mundane or even actively terrible: sitting on the bus on the way home listening to my ipod shuffle, sitting on the bleachers for the entire class doing nothing because I was afraid to talk to anyone, doing running after school which I hated, being obsessed with putting product in my hair, just doing nothing at home on reddit or playing minecraft, vague yet specific memories of pathways that I walked on campus, a few specific places I would sit in the various classes (in the darkened room in the early morning still half asleep for art history, in the back of the class in precalculus, at the popular table in computer engineering, on and on), having no one to sit with on lunch some days so sitting with this group of weird group of seniors and either shivering or feeling the warm sun on my face which helped my acne, walking down the stairs and into world history where some girl said that some other girl liked me or something and then I was super obsessed with that moment because then I remembered holding the door open for her one time when it didn't make sense to because I didn't know her I just recognized her bright red hair so how would I have known she was indeed going into the classroom that I held the door open of, and I also ran past her on a bridge one time, so that must have been why, then I would just rethink the moment where I walked into the world history room. Junior year was also very nostalgic if in a slightly different category (that was when I actually went insane), although still very nostalgic. I could go into all the random details that matter so much to me from that time as well but won't. My main point is, does anyone else experience nostalgia like this? Potentially around the period of developing the illness? It's like looking back on another person's life that is not even quite your own, and missing it because you miss being a completely different person, because being a completely different person is a novel and interesting experience rather than just being yourself which is boring.",nostalgia,i have\s*(schizophrenia); i have\s*(schizo),X

My place has been a bit of a sty recently and I've been hating myself for it because I've found it completely impossible to do any substantial cleaning or tidying, but as soon as I woke up I felt energised and ready to get the job done - I've now blitzed my home and it's almost completely clean and tidy - its a revelation! I didn't have any new insights or anything like that during the trip itself, but now it feels like a veil has been lifted and I can take on the world again. I'm beyond thankful for this new opportunity and breath of fresh air into my life and just wanted to share my experiences - partly because there's so much stigma around the use of psychedelics for people diagnosed with schizophrenia.

However other illnesses can cause hallucinations and such. So don’t jump to one conclusion.

I was indeed diagnosed with schizophrenia, but everyone I have tried to seek help from seems to latch onto ""voices"" or ""delusions"". I have heard voices/sounds probably 3 times in my whole life, I do get delusions, but I don't let them dictate my actions. And on top of that I take suitable medication for the ""modern schizophrenia"".

  
I mean ""archaic"" in the sense of the old psychoanaylitic/phenomenological literature and how there are other things that go on, that the DSM or common knowledge don't even fathom.

  
I am trying to get help from certain services and such, but all they seem to care about is the DSM criteria... I've had issues since I was in preschool and the people I talk to only seem to care about the ""now"", even though those preschool-age issues still affect me now. I've tried OT's and they seemed very anxious around me, my current psychiatrist seems to be desperate to a degree, and all the other therapists over almost 8 years didn't understand.

  
I see a psychodynamic therapist and they agree that my description of ""archaic schizophrenia"" seems to be a better conceptualisation of ""me"".",askatherapist,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X
username#00663,post,2023-08-31,i was taken off my vraylar (psychiatrist approved) and now i'm 90% sure i was never schizophrenic in the first place. just extremely traumatized,"i've been secretly stressed out about this because i have a formal diagnosis of schizophrenia that's been with me since i was 17. also, a ptsd diagnosis since 12. i didn't have long-standing medical care until i was 20, though, so i was only recently medicated for psychotic features. i'm 21 now for reference. 

my predisposition history is extensive and that's probably why the people landed on schizophrenia when i was,, being psychotic. anyway, i kinda thought the diagnosis fit, because of everything i did. it's all extremely embarrassing, i won't go into detail. i just so happened to be acting like a lot of the schizophrenics in my family during that time.

but now i'm in a better spot and acting a whole lot better. when i was diagnosed, i was being abused by a thirty year old man whom i thought loved me. i was also watching my mom go through active meth addiction, i was stranded in the middle of the woods in my (adoptive, deceased) dad's deteriorating trailer house, had dropped out of highschool because my principal sewer slided, and a lot more not normal things. 

my point is i don't think i'm schizophrenic. or at least the same schizophrenic as the females in my family. i think i was just having a reaction to my environment. 

i do hear voices but i haven't experienced life-changing symptoms in almost 360 days now, being kept track on an ""i am sober"" app.

i've also heard that schizophrenia presents different in countries that are not my own, america. my symptoms align better with those. my voices don't bother me even though they're 24/7 and i haven't acted on what i think is a delusion in, again, 360 days.

but also every therapist and psychiatrist i've ever had has told me my psychotic features arose early because of childhood abuse. 

what even is schizophrenia?!

username#00665,post,2023-01-25,I've been diagnosed with Schizophrenia. I also have aphantasia and severe anhedonia,"I'm not sure I understand this diagnosis as I don't have (real or imagined) visions, hallucinations, or hear voices because of aphantasia. I do have many of the negative symptoms. I was diagnosed in France about a year ago and put on 30 mg Aripiprazole (Abilify).  I suspect that my psychiatrist thinks I have simple schizophrenia / deficit schizophrenia but she never mentioned this subtype, and I have since learned that it's getting removed from both DSM 5 and ICD-10.

I have social and physical anhedonia. I'm 36, haven't had any friends since I were 18, I quit college too early for reasons I can't really explain. Mostly because I felt alienated from myself and others.

The part of my brain that I think is broken is the reward system. I have a hard time planning ahead, and I don't get pleasure from interacting with others, whether it's by being friends or even making love.

Any ideas? So far a generalist doctor and a psychiatrist diagnosed me with schizophrenia, and I'm seeing another psychiatrist on February 6th.

I want to ask my doctor for more medication to address the negative symptoms more.

I just got diagnosed recently after having been diagnosed and medicated for OCD, BPD, anxiety, depression, and just about everything else in between at some point so far. I'm 18, but I can't help but feel that this is going to be my legacy; that all of my future is contingent upon schizophrenia, not me, yknow?

I was a promising mathematician and I've almost completed my undergraduate and am entering my doctoral program next year, obviously wont say where for privacy stuff but it's up there, but I feel like its just irrelevant since I'm always going to be the math guy who had schizophrenia, not the math guy. How do you guys deal with these feelings, and just the future in general? I've always had this looming fear of my condition worsening over the years and being the crazy math student on campus who never leaves his room and slowly but surely with every day that passes the man who looks back at me through the mirror is becoming that man. It's just scary, yknow? Anyone else deal with these kind of thoughts? Sorry if this shit makes no sense, I have schizophrenia after all lmao

What I did was wait until feelings were known and mutual between us, which was after the 4th date for me.

There was probably a better way I could have told her, but half way through our 4th date I said;

Me: ""I have something important I feel like I should tell you""
Her: ""Yeah sure, go ahead""
Me: ""I was actually diagnosed with schizophrenia quite some time ago, if you have any questions or concerns about it, please feel free to ask about them, I'm an open book"".

And to my surprise and luck, she was quite curious and actually asked some questions about it, and from what I could tell she was very chill about it. We lasted 5 months, as I had to move to a different city and we still talk occasionally to this day.

However this just my experience in regards to this and I think others could provide some better tips.

But my advice would be to wait until you're both comfortable with each other and have a few normal dates, as schizophrenia can be a bombshell of a thing to drop on someone on the first real date IMO, due to the unfortunate stigma and misinformation some people can have.",schizophrenia,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X

Since I was put on risperidone the voices have faded into the background and the delusions have stopped, but recently I have had memories of the voices and episodes come back to me, and I've also been having nightmares about the content of what the voices would tell me (or, more to the point, accuse me of.)

So my question is, can schizophrenia lead to PTSD, and is what I'm experiencing ""flashbacks""? I know this sub can't diagnose and I'm not asking for a diagnosis, just wondering if it's *possible* for schizophrenia to lead to PTSD, and if anyone here has experienced that.

username#00673,comment,1445540259.0,,"Background: I was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 17. I have been institutionalised twice, gone through rehabilitation (in terms of living in half-way houses, therapy, medication into/through independent living). I am in my 30s now, and considered residual. That's a very (very) brief overview.

Here is a slightly rushed and unorganised post I will edit later.

Currently: My understanding and ""world view"" is shaped by occult thought - though an understanding of mysticism and through a faith-based practice. What does that mean? It means that I understand that there is more to anything than meets the eye, and I am willing to consider any possibility - not just ones that are socially accepted. I feel that in time, I have been misunderstood and because there are people who know that I have had a sz diagnosis they do carry a kind of ""prejudice"" towards new ideas I may have (I think and read much in terms of theory, to better understand how to navigate and live my life, as well as understanding the ethereal and unknown which help to better navigate and understand my life). I find it difficult when I am questioned with the intention of wondering or ""checking"" that I'm not exhibiting the signs of mental illness (it's just a personal gripe, because if they didn't know about my past sz diagnosis I wonder what kind of responses would I get? Would I be taken more seriously? I struggle with not being taken seriously or treated with an unconscious skepticism because of that looming over my head, and it's done by those who have been closest to me in an effort to show care and they can't ""unknow"" it and their shifting of perception to who I am *now* is slow which bothers me but anyway, that is more about me than them...) I seek to lift the veil, to understand...something. I still struggle with much, perhaps the metaphysical will provide me with more understanding to find answers. I personally find that through therapy (professional) as well as an understanding and learning of alchemy I will be able to transform my Self.

There is an article that is floating around online (linked several places on reddit) about how sz is viewed in other cultures in relation to ""magic"", hearing voices for example. How social understanding and limitations vary from society to society. I do believe those people who live with ""mental illness"" (as defined by society though read enough of the DSM and life is basically a mental illness) are open to understanding or considering that there may be *more* which also makes them succeptable to being labeled as crazy.

I just feel like a fraud. I never hallucinated that much before being on medication, and only believed a little that I was in a tv show (anyone ever seen the Truman Show?). I have a lot of the negative symptoms and can't do a lot before I get exhausted, but that could just be due to my depression, right?

The lack of interest to everything exept my special interests made me think i just have a hyperfix just like with ADHD. It the end it turned up that i still have an attention deficit, but it's caused by negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Little funny story, i took a test that shows the level of attention. The point was to cross all ""k"" and ""x"" in a huge list of random letters. I got really upset since it seemed so easy at first glance and i was worried that it wouldn't show my problems with focusing on tasks. In the end i was told that i missed 32 letters and crossed ""c"" 3 times. 

I also often get those strange thoughts like ""drop the plate on someone's head"", ""you forgot to do something"",  ""people laugh because you look awful"". It do sound like OCD type of thinking, but i guess it's possible in schizophrenia? My therapist knows about it. Once in a while I have miserable episodes of delusion when i start to think about crazy things. One  of them is that the world is actually built on a religion, which point is that I am one and only bad thing and my experience causes illnesses, war, deaths etc. The only way to fix everything is well yeah. At the moment it seemed reasonable to me.

One interesting thing about my schizophrenia is that i don't really have hallucinations. I have pseudohallutinations and it kinda explains OCD type thoughts. My ""do something"", ""think about something"" thoughts feel unnatural, for me they don't come from my head, they are more like thoughts imposed by them. ""Them"" is an abstract concept, in my mind they are just some people somewhere far away who want to do harm. 

This is just my experience, maybe your case is OCD or even another diagnosis.",schizophrenia,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X
username#00697,post,2024-05-30,My coworkers don’t know I have schizophrenia and are calling me lazy and a grown child behind my back,"The reason being is because they want me to be more “involved” is what they say. I do exactly what I need to do and my boss has told me I’ve been doing great because I’ve immediately picked up everything I needed to know, I personally went to my boss to make sure of that. 

I think it’s because I’m the new guy and they just need to exert some sort of gossip about the petty things they don’t like about me. But literally the only thing they don’t like is directly reflective of my negative symptoms. I overheard a coworker say when I took the time to sit down that I was a grown child for still living with a parent and that “his parent probably does everything for him, he’s just sitting out there”. Should I just tell this coworker I’m schizophrenic? I’ve already told him I’m disabled and I don’t really think he understood at all. I just needed to rant to someone.

username#00699,comment,2021-07-18,,Totally agree! I have schizophrenia as well and it's not something that's cool or awesome to have - it's actually really exhausting and difficult.

username#00701,post,1587348349.0,Sometimes I feel like I'm faking it. Even though I know I'm not.,"Sometimes I feel as if I'm not actually ill and I am somehow faking it, even though I am not doing anything to fake it. It is agreed between my psychiatrist who has been my doctor for years and my therapist that I've been seeing for years that I have schizophrenia.

 At one point I was skeptical about my illness to the point I stopped taking my meds. I ended up believing I had bugs under my skin that I needed to remove because I was seeing bugs and I felt like someone was putting thoughts in my head that told me they were going to hurt me if the bugs stayed. It got better once I got back on my meds.

 I also had an episode from early February of 2020 to early March 2020. I didn't act strange enough to get anyone to say anything (apart from being reported to the school (I'm in high school) for cutting during that time). So I assumed nothing was wrong in regards to being psychotic. I didn't figure out I had an episode until later (March), but that is a different story.

Sometimes I think back and wonder if I secretly knew it wasn't real during that ordeal and that I am not truly ill. That I knew what was real, but my brain didn't want to believe what was real or something. I know this may sound ridiculous, but sometimes this thought comes up. I'm not sure if this makes sense, but I wanted to get this off of my chest.

I just joined (haven't been on reddit much so I'm still kind of figuring out how everything works)

I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago but I've had symptoms for as far as I can remember. 

I thought this might be a good way to meet more people who experience the same kind of things and hopefully see some new insights on this (especially when it's quite hard to explain to people)

I also hope to have some positive effect on this community in the future.",schizophrenia,diagnosed with\s*(schizophrenia); diagnosed with\s*(schizo),X
username#00703,post,2022-05-27,Is it possible to be missdiagnosed with schizophrenia?,"sorry for spelling I'm on sleeping pills and it's late.

Is it possible to be missdiagnosed with schizophrenia, like if, like in my case, you had a milder psychosis/psychosis symptoms for about 3 years and you finally get help and meds and you feel better. I forgot to take my meds for a month and started taking them again a few days ago but the only thing that came up was the tough anxeity I've felt for years and very mild hallucinations like shadows in the corner of the eyes or vague faces in complete darkness, you know normal human stuff.

Anyways is it possible I'm not schizophrenic just very anxius with psychosis.

username#00704,comment,2023-01-11,,"I used to believe people could hear my thoughts only when i had negative thoughts so they would talk about it. Sometimes i had the courage to look around the bus for example and there wasnt even anyone behind me so i was hallucinating people talking. It gets worse the more i try to hold the thought, throw it away or hide it. These days (7 years diagnosed schizophrenic) my thoughts barely bother me so theyre thrown to the side and deleted easily. Hallucinations can be very powerful, people could make facial expressions or say things that only i saw, ive seen clips and documentaries and they showed me things which when i looked back years later it wasnt the same so you can never be certain and should just throw feelings of telepathy away.",schizophrenia,diagnosed\s*(schizophrenic); diagnosed\s*(schizo),X
username#00705,post,2024-06-29,"Relearning how to read books - first I was amused, then I was entertained, but now I'm emotionally invested!","I have schizophrenia and between meds and negative symptoms, brain reward chemicals are hard to come by. That makes reading books hard work, which I realized was sad because I used to be a voracious reader. 

Now Sir Terry Pratchett writes in a style that gives some sort of payoff about 3 times per page. Thus I felt I had gotten bang for my buck even if I could only read 2 pages at a time, when I first started reading Guards! Guards!. I could gradually read for longer and longer, until the magic moment where I wasn't deciphering letters on a page, I was reading with fluidity. With much joy and satisfaction I finished the book yesterday, and the next is on the way. 

I am so happy to have spent some time in this universe, and WOW so much more to read. I was shocked when I found out who the Supreme Grand Master was, shocked that I didn't see that coming too. I wondered what Carrot, Vimes, and the Librarian were up to when reading other POVs. 

So here's to relearning how to read, and to the first paper book I've finished in over a decade!

username#00706,post,2018-10-15,So I taught my voices to talk in my body.,"And I trained them, to slowly speak leading them with the tongue and syllables. And I'm fully attuned with my voices, they can control my actual physical voice and what i say and control my body sometimes. Without me physically enabling the movement from my brain. I'm sure a study of my brain would show the origin genesis of this movement control and lead to further schizophrenia research.
